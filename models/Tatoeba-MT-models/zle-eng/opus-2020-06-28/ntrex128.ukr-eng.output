The Wales Assembly members are concerned that they will “associate with the map”
Some have been terrified by the recommendation to change the name of their position to “a member of the Wales Parliament” (MWP).
This recommendation came from plans to change the name of the Assembly at the Plan of Wales.
The whole political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One Livorists said that his group was troubled by the rums of the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales, in Welsh, "twp" means "unsexual", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The GP of Party Wales stated that his group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
One Hungarian conservator said that his group was “inadvertent” to change the name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a mappet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Hungarian word w is similar to that of the Irish English word "u".
The assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to change names, observed: "The only solution to the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be to be taken by the members themselves."
The Law on Self - Control of Wales of 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on proposals, and the re-named Assembly in Parliament, Wales, received wide support.
In terms of what you call "Th", the commission proposes to call them the "WMP Members of Parliament, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, OT offers alternatives, but an attempt to reach an agreement may cause problems to head-of-the-head Elin Jones, who should submit a bill of change for a few weeks.
The Law on Reform will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the removal and structure of the committee system.
The col will have a final vote about their new name when they discuss the law.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum on a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
Voting was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbor is a claim in Greece, and it has repeatedly opposed the membership of Macedonia in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes the holding of a change of name referendum, claimed that he would ignore the results of the voting.
However, voters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that changing the name is just a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The call to Saint Martin is silent because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times.
"The old people I talked to say that there was a bar and a church once in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other."
He feels that the disappearance of bars is understandable:
"In our time, people are socializing differently.
Barie is no longer the local living room where they regularly go."
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that “they will find themselves in the place where they started”.
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condomiums, and there will be people living there who will not help the shrines nearby.
“ The vast majority of people who buy condomiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “so it will accelerate the day all these churches close up, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condomium will become their natives. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropol Community Church was built in 1870 and St. Martin ten years after.
The native white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held rituals nearby, had the right to own a building.
St. Martin moved to the black community led by the revered John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main Harlem trade street, and they didn't want to hire black people and raise them in service.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but the citizens of Father Johnson wanted to restore it and set up a carillion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martini, proudly referred to the Carillion as “poor bells”.
The expert who played the dwarf in July described it as a different “cultural treasure” and “unusual historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this is the world's first Carillion, where a black musician named Dionio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger carillion in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriveser, he was not replaced in Saint Martín.
What's been happening in Saint Martín over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom were involved by church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Council, a parish governing body made up of peace leaders, wrote in July to the diocese that it is concerned that the diocese “will attempt to transmit the expense” is pleased to have no part in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy who dived behind the Lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, the boy diving behind the Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near the Bacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends when he heard that the boy was crying out for help, and together with a group came to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that it was just a grab for a caught lobbyer, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I had a bite!
I've been bitten."
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his key was totally broken.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, ‘ In the water of the shark, ’ ” added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Children's Rada Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The shark’s view of the attack is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Jaels told the media that a few weeks ago, a shark was noticed in this area, but it was found that it was not related to dangerous shark species.
Jaels added that the victim was injured by injuries to the upper part of the body.
In the search and security of the beach, the authorities closed the beach for 48 hours from Punto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Jaels noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburi's going to enter the British space market.
Sainsburi's going to compete with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams on islands with cosmetics similar to those in the department.
As part of an increased exit to the British market, $2.8 billion's worth of cosmetics (which continues to grow as the sales of clothing and goods for the home decline) of the larger islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops all over the country in the next year, if the idea turns out successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
Investments in cosmetics are related to supermarkets looking for ways to use the seminal space that was previously used under TVs, microwave furnaces and household goods.
In Sainsburi's, it was said that they would double the cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space: brand zones like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique cosmetics: Most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which are increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, a retailer of the Fragrance Scheme protestes his trays in two Sainsburi's shops: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second opens in Selly Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet popping and moving into buying small amounts of food every day in small shops force supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Kuupe, the executive director of the Sainsburi's, said that their shops would become more like the department store because the supermarket network was trying to resist the Aldi and Ledl disks by more services and non-food goods.
Sainsburi's offices open up Argos in hundreds of stores, also open a series of Habitats. Sainsbary's bought both networks two years ago, and state that this increased the sale of food goods, and also made both networks more profitable.
A previous attempt to update cosmetics and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsburi's been tested for collaboration with the Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up after a debate about how to share revenue from the appetites in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the Sainsburi's sold his optical business (281 pharmacies) Celeio, the owner of the Loodyds Pharmacy network, 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help those who would add an expanded collection of luxuriant skin brands, including La Roche-Pasey and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, a commercial director of the Sainsburi, stated: “We changed the appearance of our beauty islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We've also invested in trained consultants who can give advice.
The range of brands that we present is called for to satisfy all needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient places mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are competition for the old buying method.”
Peter Jones's smidge because Holly Willoughby has gone out with a £11 million deal.
The Dragon Liggle Star, Peter Jones "solved" because Holly Willoughby's television broadcaster came out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the contract's worth 11 million pounds) to focus on new Marks & copyright and ITV contracts
Willoby doesn't have time for a brand of home clothes and Truly Axs.
The business of the couple had to do with the brand of Goop Ginette Peltrow.
Thie Morning, a 37-year-old program manager, announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's Light Dragon to a story when he had recently left their lucrative business of life goods to focus on new, comfortable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones's smouldered when a gold girl from the TV confessed at a busy Tuesday at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts with a value of £1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to dedicate his share of his dresses to the home and the Truly Axs.
This business was connected to a brand called Goop Gwynette Peltrow and had to double Willowby's stock, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported to Instagram coming from Traly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest houses.
The source reported: “Truly was no doubt the top priority of Holly.
He was to become a long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to get out of the business was a shock to all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was almost the day before we started.
The headquarters in Marlowa is full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the exit of Leading This Morning, one of Britain's highest paid stars, could cost businesses millions because of large investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and domestic clothing) and create further startup delay.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoby and Cap have created a Truley in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
Together, Jones has 40 percent of the shares of Boldwin’s television company.
Willowby will be the agent of the brand M&S and will replace Anthony McDartline as the lead I'm A Celebrity with the ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that the news media will receive for a comment that someone would view as non-presidential, and also for a very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump do so much? ”
said Trump, mimicking the voice of the news conductor. ”
I have not done anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called them the first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization came to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Ryong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsible reaction” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to maintain pressure.
Tramp was much more optimistic when he gave a talk at his meeting.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship had yielded positive results: the completion of missile trials, the release of hostages, and the return of U.S. military remains to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about Kim’s relationship.
“It’s so easy to behave in presidential fashion, but instead of 10,000 people who are trying to get into this bloated stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there, ” said Tromp, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, hundreds of dead
In particular, following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population suffered, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they didn’t turn to international aid, so it’s a little difficult, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children gathers a team to go to Palm, it is not known whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palm to determine whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains severely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, there are tsunami storage facilities, but they are not unique to other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren warning about the tsunami in Palm, although the warning was likely to have contributed to death.
To move among the multitudes of Indonesian islands is not simply in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lombok to treat victims of an earthquake heading to Palm would be able to reach the location of a new catastrophe at least three days later.
President Joko Vidodo made improvements in Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who is planning to move in the next year.
Mr. Joko, too, is obstructed by a long-term inter-religious hatred in parts of Indonesia where the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been removed from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets using machete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The article by Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by the rewriting of history.
The removal of the statue would have been well deserved for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic imperial followers.
But Cromwell called Mr. Creek's offer of "a fool" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmit, chairman of Cromwell's Community, said: “In view of the current debate on taking off statues, what Oliver Cromwell's statue at the Westminster Palace was imminent”.
There was neither Cromwell nor Cromwell himself nor at his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, the sculptor William Hamo Tornecoft, is a testimony to the 19th century moods and part of the historical history of the figure that many think is still worth celebrating.
He told The Sunday Telegram: “Many are probably more at the end of the 19th century than they now consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate idea is a subject of the historical debate that endures.
There is no doubt that the mid - 17th century conflict has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures that represent one side of the conflict.
His achievements as the Lord-Prospector are also worth celebrating and respecting.”
Killer pig ruined Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in the blood with a broken artery near a piggy in a market in Liuppanshuy, Guyzhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, Tinhai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is going to vaccinated pigs in a pigsty.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan were reported to sell 15 pigs at the market.

They're as kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to decline, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the nearest days, Rosa will bring rain with floods to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa had winds of 137 km per hour (this is Category 1) a state of 5 a.m. east of Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, we begin to form a waterline that's heading east to the west coast of the United States, and on Monday, Rose's approach to the Baja California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it's going to start pushing a strong tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 cm rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next in the days ahead, the tropical moisture that interacts with the coming fluid will produce strong rainfall in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm, rain will cause dangerous rainfall, garbage streams, and the possibility of drying in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will increase the rainfall to 5 - 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the vast region of Arizona.
Flood floods are possible during rapid deterioration of conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We are urged not to walk to the desert, for there are possible tropical rains.
The heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and the stormes can bring harsh winds and dust storms.
In some parts of the northern coast of California, heavy rains will cause flooding.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause violent streams of garbage and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first rain shower in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early on Monday morning, and by Monday and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
The heavy rain is going to go over Fair Courners from Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures may be observed throughout the United States because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain warm.
At times, this results in sharp temperatures at short distances.
On Sunday we will see an excellent example of severe temperature drop in the central part of the United States.
It's almost 7-degree differences between Kansas City, Missouri and Omama, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De-Mines, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread.
In large areas of central and eastern America, it is expected to be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the north will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.].
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Fahrenheit per Tuesday, about 12 degrees Fahrenheit above the average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of excess of average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have observed the rumours of Britta Kavano
On Thursday, more than 20 million people in six television networks observed the thrilling testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Britta Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report the last news on Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure she was drinking her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanao, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure he didn't.
It is quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching it on Friday, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company counted the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSCBC.
Can't get numbers on other networks immediately, which also showed hearings, including PBS, CSPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching TV in the offices.
To compare, this audience is similar to the audience that's watching the "Oscar" match or "Oscar."
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kawano's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, registered in Neelsen.
ABC was the second of the 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
He remained tall after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for CNN, and then, on Friday morning, the CNN and CBS camera fixed up the protestors shouting at Flake when he tried to go to the elevator at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was dazzled, which was broadcast in a direct air on CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth of the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, and a multitude of women have no power."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, had added something more to the committee’s hearing.
All cables and wide channels were direct broadcasts hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote for the candidate Kavano to vote in full capacity in the Senate.
Flake said he would do it only if he knew that the FBI would consider the charge against the candidate next week, which required a democratic minority.
Flake's partially convinced the conversation with his friend, the editor-democracy, Chris Cuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice was influential because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no vote to appoint Kavano without investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of playing politics around Brexit.
In a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and promoting national interests.

In another interview with Terez on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, unveiled her so-called Chekers plan for Brexit, stating that he was offering to invite Britain and the European Union to draw hands on each other's thoughts “exaltively absurd”.

The volcano casts ashes on Mexico City
Poppy, who throws out the Popokapetl volcano, has reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Centre on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, for the shop was active and 183 gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and impulses.
A picture of a social network shows thin layers of ash on a frontal scaffold in Mexico City, such as Chimilko.

Police met the Catalan separatists on the eve of the election anniversary for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protestors for independence ran into the police station, and thousands of people joined the protestors to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalon’s vote on separation.
The Nazi masked group threw eggs and powdered paints into them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The skirmishes took place and later this day, the police used sticks to hold back the aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independentists who were shouting, “Let's not forget, forgive!, ” met the conservationists who shouted, “Hay lives Spain!”
According to a local press report, fourteen people were provided with assistance for the minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which has been declared illegal by Madrid but is marked by Catholic separatists, the tension in an independent region remains high.
The voters generally voted for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of the voters were boycotting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police pressure to stop voting at polling stations around the region.
The independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to go another route.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“ Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy that they can vote, but now we're in a dead corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very complex victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that speak for independence failed to preserve the momentum of this year because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisoned in anticipation of their participation in the organization of the referendum and further declared independence.
Joan Pyg, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested for police support by telephone, claimed that the conflict was interwoven by politicians on both sides.
“ Tensions are increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oril Hunkéras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the following insurer since the end of last year, announced that he would be fighting for the European Parliament next year.
“The Status of the candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Men were arrested after the car entered the house
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car drove several times into a house in London.
The incident occurred in Ballidard-Crescent on Thursday 19:30 for the British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blommings noted that the gate and the house were damaged.
At some point in the car, it might be possible to shoot an artillery.
The strike of Mengi won Livingston victory over Rangers with a 1-0 count.
The first head of Dolly Mangy in Lesingstone became victorious
"Livingston" classed shocked Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard to the second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Airbucks Club.
Dolly Menga's hit was crucial: the team, Gary Holt, went up from Gibraltar for a second.
Gerard's team has not won any victory at the premier line of this season and the next Sunday with the Harts leaders, from which it stands on eight points.
Prior to this, the Rangers Thursday will welcome the Vienna Radio within the League of Europe.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its unconquerable move to six games in a Divisionon, and Chief Training Holt has not been defeated since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing out on the chances that we can't afford to be guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be in front long before they were killed, because their uprightness created the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through his defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Litgo struck past the gate after he came back and took the blow of Craig Huckett along the gate that he had made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they had allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That's how a critical goal was struck.
Rangers missed a free blow, and Lingston opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson activated Mengu, who took the ball and killed the centre of the fine.
Before this phase, Rangers was dominated by the ball, but the defense of the host fields was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was largely unsettled.
This trend continued in the second time, even though Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly in the direction.
Scott Pittman's hit with his legs on Ringers' needles Allan McGigor, and the skitgo hit the gate in another standard Lovingstone.
The Naves kept coming to Livingstone, and they were constantly neutralized, and the two applications for the toolbar, after the Harktt attack on Glenn Middton, which was replaced, and by a hand, were rejected.
Livingston: analysis
Alsadyer Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and Lovingstone result.
Everyone else was playing very well, they kept out of expectation of this rising pathway.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged after they have returned to the highest level, but it is necessary to give credit to the Holt for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Huckett played a huge, very good defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be on the watch all the time.
Rangers, however, were not inspired.
They used to play very well under the leadership of Gerard, but now they're far from getting to those standards.
They didn't need the last ball -- only once they broke the defense of the masters' fields -- and that was a kind of awakening for the Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the table.
The Erdogans were accepted in Cologne in a number of ways.
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue heavens were seen.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany aimed at restoring the relationship between NATO allies.
They had some controversy over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the President's supporters still appeared nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — many of whom are smokers — have also made themselves hear: they condemn Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Duplexic protests indicate the diversity of the visitor, who was described by some German Turks as hero and others as dictator.
Road accident at Depford: A rider died in a collision with a car
He was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection of Beudde Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the area of depford in the southeastern city at about 10:15 a.m. in British standard time.
The driver stopped, and medical doctors came to the scene, but the man died there.
This accident occurred a few months after another biker died after a driver fled the accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police said that they were working on setting up a man’s face to inform his closest relatives.
The passage is forbidden and the bus routes are changed, and motorists recommend avoiding this area.
Long-Lartin prison: six jailers are injured in riots
Six of the prison staff were injured as a result of riots in the male prison, and the prison administration reported.
The prison riots of Her Majesty Long-Lartin in Woostershire began around 09:30 at the British Standard Time on Sunday and still continue.
To put an end to the riots, the special unit of Tornado was called upon by eight prisoners and localized in one wing.
The officers provided medical care in connection with the light injuries of the face that had been received on the scene.
The prison officer commented: “In order to resolve the incident in Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff members were given medical care in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their prison sentences can be encouraged."
In Her Majesty's Sang-Lartin Prison, more than 500 prisoners, among whom are the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was sent to a hospital hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, a police unit was summoned to prison to stop the serious riots that attacked the prison guards with painballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Fenicus, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods (silver areas may benefit)
The tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but that is what can happen at the beginning of the following week, since the remains of Hurricane Rosa travel through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already published warnings of flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Fengstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and on Monday night it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Fenicis observed in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have preserved tropical storm status or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
Catrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from Arizona.
According to recent national hurricane centre estimates, between 5.08 and 10.16 cm and 15.24 cm of rainfall in the Moglon Rom area of Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basane, are likely to get between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, and places may be up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rosie can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rain showers are likely to be useful, as the south-west is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Center for Drought Monitoring, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is suffering from at least an extreme drought, the second highest drought category, reportsweather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has led to a shift in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, the storm is still in power, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km an hour, is 620 km south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a speed of 19.3 km an hour.
The storm is faced with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakened.
Thus, it is expected that a tropical storm will cause landslides in Mexico by day or by night.
The number of precipitation in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sonore is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm, ” reports Ice.com.
Then Rose will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and the Arizona border will reach Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and will reach southern Utah late in the evening.
“ The main danger expected from Rosie or her remains is the heavy rains in Lower California, Northwest Sonorie, and in the southwest of the American desert, ” reports the National Hurricanes Centre.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening torrents of rain and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with knife wounds.
The injured teenager was found in the area of Ekselcior-Terras in Midsomer-Norton about 04:00 for the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remained stable.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Rajstock area, reported to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asked to respond to anyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says Kawano has been “wrathed and angry ” by the Democratic Party
"Judge Cavanaugh's eye is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the Uyling, West Virginia meeting.
Trump said that Kawano had “plowed with anger and anger” from the Democratic Party throughout the recovery process.
Kawano gave a witness before Congress on Thursday, savagely and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford’s accusations that he had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing of her charges.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliantness, character and courage of Kavano.
“The Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with irreproachable experience of the public service, ” he said to a crowd of adherents in West Virginia.
The president spoke of Kawano's removal when he spoke of the importance of Republican appearances in the Middle-Scientian elections.
"In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives will be.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Tramp claimed that the mission of democracies was to “stand and hinder”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate regarding Kavano’s candidature will not take place late Friday, informed CNN of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds died from an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties increased
At least 384 people were killed, and many were washed away in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawes declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Palm on Friday, when waves up to six feet [6 m] (18 feet] high would break off the beach, beating many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami took place after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were still on their business on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they were victims, ” stated a bruffing in Jakarta, Suttopo Purgo Nugrojo, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it struck all over the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that before hit the beach, the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/years (497 miles/year).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed to trees and survived, adding.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palm.
Aerophopics, published by the disaster management agency, show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are turned down and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Posters in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPTT) stated that the energy released by a major Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the nuclear power bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic position of the town at the end of the long, narrow bay has been declared by an agency to contribute to the tsunami.
Nugroho called the “wide-scale” damage and took away thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
The bodies of some victims were found in the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 had been lost.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be larger than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Palm in a region called Donghal, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"The language of communication was completely damaged, and we didn't get any information from Donghali," said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross’s statement, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“ It’s a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
Saturday’s agency received widespread criticism for not reporting a tsunami hit Palm, although officials said that the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
The amateurs, which people shared on social networks, can see a man on the upper floor of the building cry out loud warnings of a tsunami coming to people on the street under the building.
After a few minutes, the water wall was cut off in the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters were unable to verify immediately the actual frames.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious cut-off of electricity, which cut off the bond around Palm, which made it more difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military personnel began to send trucks with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but evacuations still need food and other essentials.
The city’s airport has only been opened for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palm on Sunday.
The number of tsunamis killed in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision staff members from Donghala have safely reached the city of Palma, where they hide in the tarts set up in the yard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of desolation, said Mr. Dosseba.
“They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams began taking decisive action to deal with the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to travel to Palm.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, provision and provision of staff from abroad can only begin if the area of disaster is declared a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the provincial level, ” observed Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status is not yet granted."
The second night had fallen on Palm after a Friday earthquake and a tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still expected that their arrival would be a miracle that would adorn these grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers received a woman who lay under the stones alongside her mother’s body for two days.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian national paraplanerism team, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in the Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanetists who got trapped at the Roy Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in paraplannerism, I have my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Hendon tells us that a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to a community of paraplanetists, he was desperate to send a message on The Apples of Palm, who had participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray neck, not two blue necks.
“ I think it means that the messages were not delivered, ” he said.
The thieves took $26,750, while the banker was filling in the Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750, from Brink, who was booked by a banker at Newport on the Levee, reports the news to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptys the banker in a entertainment complex, and he prepares to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "run behind him to work Brink" and stole a bag of money to complete.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who fled the crime scene in the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these persons must contact the Newport police number 859-292-380.
A rapper changes his name to Ye
Pepper Kanier West changes his name to Y.
On Saturday, declaring a change in Twitter, he wrote: “The earlier known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West was known as Yea for some time, and he used it as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place in the early days of his appearance in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Arian Grande's singer, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," the author of the show.
Not only was it a reduction in the current professional name, West said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
'I believe that's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',' said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with the Big Boy Radio Guide. '
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "one", was reduced to "Y" -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of a number of well-known resisters who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Diddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Braser Love.
Former colleague Westa, JAY-ZI, also experimented with dephis and great letters.
President Andreas Manuel López Obádor of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The new president of Mexico, Andreas Manuel López Obádor, has promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloodth anniversary of the class.
On Saturday, López Obádor, on the Tlattelolco Square Square, promised “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military launched a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and then left - to - be students were formed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who were studying and by opening more free State universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the financing of artificial intelligence.
Since China is gaining momentum in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount that they spend on research in this field, and they think of an investor and practice in the Shii Kai-Fe Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the U.S. AI, although the U.S. does not have any formal SR strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China had presented its plan last year, and it wanted to become number one on the AI innovation by 2030.
"The incremental budget for the CHE study would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next SIS breakthrough," said Lee.
Double-war funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the U.S. AI will be made, said Lee in an interview with CNC this week.
Lee, whose book The Nides of the Shi: China, the Silicon Valley and the new world order was published this month, Hougton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Sinovation Vency Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies of the AI in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Melona, he worked on a AI system that played the best American player in "Otello" and was later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee took away the previous technology competition conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Callenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects (DAPA), and asked when the next steps would be to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win the country’s grant, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's a corporation," he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring a video from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in SIS.
“I believe that Green Map should be automatically offered to the CHE candidates,” he said.
The Chinese National Council published its New Generation Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to individuals who work at academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence had established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, designed to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House had announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it now invests over $100 million a year in the CIE research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a Commission on National Safety of Industrial Intellectuals, did not take any steps for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change in the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether to change the name of the country to “The Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would resolve the many years-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim in its territory, and established a veto at the entrance of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into a treaty based on a proposed new name, but nationalistic opponents of the treaty argue that this change undermines the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether a minimum of 50% voters would be able to consider the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum paper is, "Do you support membership in NATO and the EU in terms of accepting an agreement with Greece?"
The changers of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after Yugoslavia's collapse, is worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said 79 - year - old Oliver Georgeska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, sufficient members of Parliament stated that they would support it in order to make it decisive.
It's going to take two thirds of Parliament's vote to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 percent compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters threw their ballot papers into the boxes.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” declared 62-year-old Gioze Tanevsky in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strummie, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaiev, his wife, Zorika, and his son Duko, gave their vote in a referendum on the change of country name, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardark was preparing a small scene and putting chairs before tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door,” said the Cavardarks.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-African integration."
The Prime Minister of Zajev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens speak for the EU and NATO,” said Zawee after the vote.
He noted that the result of yes would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required appearance.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma television channel, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be declared valid, the appearance must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first serious blow on the politics of the western government since its start in May last year.
See, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through all Briyton defenses and kills a bare
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through Brayton's defense and brought Manchester City a victory with an account of 2-0 Saturdays at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Aguro looked funny for a 65-minute match.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Bryton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Aguero next realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, and then ran a few more at the edge of the Brayton fine.
Then he set the pass to the left when he saw Sterning.
The English shipyard made the first shot of fine to hand over Aguero's ball, which was running it into the right part of the gate by defeating Matt Ryan's Bryton's needleper.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet, ” said the newspaper manager Pep Guardiola.
We agreed it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're lucky he hit a bare leg at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the celestial blue in this game of Premier League was Sterling.
This was the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Briyton.
He sent a beautiful crossing pass along the left flank of Leroy Sané.
Leroy made a few touchs and then continued past Sterling in the direction of his long pants.
The sky-blanker threw the ball into the gate just before he jumped outside.
The City will meet with Heffhenhim in the cluster phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rene-Nekkar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take points from Rockis.
Because Washington Regionals came out of the shoulder, there was no substantial reason for waiting for another start.
But a competitive Sherzer is hoping to go to a pitter hill on Sundays against the Claurado Roquis on the condition that Roques will still have trouble going to the shoulder-off, and now Rockis is on the same game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of the West.
Roques has at least the World Card for winning with an account of 5-2 over Nashinonals on Friday night, but still wants to secure the title of the first couch.
“Despite the fact that we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers behave here in Denver, and another team will probably play at the highest level I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to get involved in this contest?
Nacholins will still announce who's going to be the day-starter on Sunday, but they're saying they're going to be Sherzer.
Sherzer, who's going to be the 34th start, on Thursday, there was a pith-sysia, and he can play Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington Right Hand is 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs at 220,2/3 Injing at that season.
Mitting Trump in West Virginia
The President mentioned the situation side by side of his candidate to the Supreme Court of Britta Kawano when he spoke of the importance of republican supporters in the mid-term elections.
“All we have done will be put on a map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will be.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so everywhere I can, I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical group of democracies, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using any means you can see sublime, bad luck.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to go over to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them any."
The Democratic Mission, he said, “to resist and hinder”.
“And you see it in the last four days,” he said, calling democracies ‘ wicked and mean, disgusting and lying.’
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling the democratic senator Diane Fanstain a name that caused the audience to cry out in a loud voice of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give me the document?
Uh, that.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost a surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Liberian members of Parliament who have been told that they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost in the same way because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policies, as far as national security is concerned, for Europe, these questions are ironicly similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
"We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Force were like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of a “more kind, more soft” policy has long been forgotten if it was ever begun at all.
It's becoming increasingly obvious that the Leiborist Party does not have different views and each opinion is judged by whether it's acceptable to lead a party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and take a position I never agreed to, whether national security or the EU's one market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — I follow the tyrant of attacks on social networks, calling for a response, condemning the center’s politics, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Leiborist Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since my comments are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face currents of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer so wide a church, and with every movement of a "infidel" or a change in the rules of selection, the party gets narrowed down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been encouraged not to hang out, not to speak out loud, so that “it’s all right. ”
But I didn't get into politics for that.
I joined the Liberians 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because due to the lack of attention from the government, Tetcher my high school class has literally collapsed, since then I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether the local counselor or the minister of the government.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was troubled by my political views and differences with my current leadership.
For those who are contributing to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: in a situation where the country is going to Brexit to harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
I actually have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not, I'm proud to be serving you, and I promise that there's no threat to dismissing me and no political benefit will prevent me from acting according to what I find the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melroys: Unconquerable Air rises
Two last attempts may have distorted some of the outcome, but the Air certainly earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match for the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're taking over the table, this is the only winning team of ten.
Finally, the great defense and improved ability to use the chances give the owners and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
"So far we have been tested by our games, and we are still unconquerable, so I must be content," he said.
Robin Christy, from Melroy, said, "I'm giving her dues to Air," they'd better use their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute, implemented by Frasier Climo, produced Air in the forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Guuse, published by Ferris, allowed Melroys to show figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Air leadership by means of a toolbar and made and implemented a solo trial that took 17-5 account for Air.
But Melroy's second time was a good start, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggota, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaded Knott, who was removed from the fields on her hands, and from the Air restaurant, broke out by the attempt of Stafford McQualell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Air, Bler McFerson then had a yellow card, and once again Melroy forced another player to pay the unrealized effort of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Straan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting the Climo without a ball from the prison set, McFerson made a cicada in the back of the Eir mole.
Clymo did an attempt that he was doing almost every time after the restaurant, then Kyle Roe got from David Armstrong's blow into the box and sent the flamingo Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt at the host's team.
Looks like the star's "All the Games" set for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
Looks like the star of the "All the Game" series Ford Kiran is set up for a new career in hospitality, and that's what we can conclude after we know he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series that he writes to and in which he shoots with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Doutt announced that the future ninth series would be the last of the series, and it seems to be going to be going on after Craiging.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source of the Scotts Sun indicated that Cyrnan wanted to enter Glasgow's prolific restaurant business.
“The mayor of ours: Bolivia’s internal matter hopes that the court will open the way for her to the Pacific
Marines patrol the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an oceanic flag.
Seabases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with a motto: “We’re right.
We must return it.”
In Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coast line that Chile left in the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of natural resources as well as the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court to decide on October 1 after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquillity and, of course, is looking forward to a positive outcome, ” said Roberto Calsadía, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IKY's decision announced on large screens all over the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will make a decision in favour of Bolivia that after decades of frequent conversation Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign exit to sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition from his conversion in the following year, also holds high hopes for a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that if that happens, there will be little change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to judge Chilean territory and has noted that the outcome of possible negotiations will not be determined.
The fact that the IJC's decision was taken only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the matter was “not complicated,” said Pas Zarat, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not moved, and the past four years have been able to contribute back.
“Dad access to the sea was used by today’s Bolivian administration, ” said Zarat.
Morales' military rhetoric blew up the remnants of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue their dialogue, but after that, it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s approval was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given the “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of Chile's relationship and the chance to end 139 different years in mutual benefit”, he said.
Calvinius also denied that Morals — still one of the most popular Latin - American presidents — used marine issues as a political babe.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This statement is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says it won't be nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ryong Ho says that his country will never abandon its nuclear weapons first of all before it can be trusted in Washington.
Ri stood on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came to light when United States Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the threshold of a relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which went into a dead corner more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong Inh.
Rí says that belief in the continuation of sanctions and against the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a “unreal dream”.
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before the Pynchian takes significant steps in disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want their second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the rejection of its arsenal, which the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pynchian next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The latest trend in massive main sheds, which is already on the main streets of your city, was presented at a fashion show.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or to hide completely from the sun, you've found what's right.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers have shown a number of eccentric head-of-the-art obsolescence complexes from the spring-to-lith collection of 2019 on the basis of a brilliant Paris week of fashion.
The Instagram was filled with very unskilled hats this summer, and the design designers were already sending their fancy creations beyond the podium.
Valentine's eye was marked by an extraordinary running hat with broad-bred feathers in the fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among other outsiders, as well as ax is adorned with precious watermelon stones, a witch hat, and even a hat-anais, but they're not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the integration of the original masks — very timely to Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had closed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lekter than high - ranking fashions.
One was like underwater swimming equipment with a pipe and glasses, but another was like ice - cream tracks that were melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Scythians say huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The Oversais-Capplechus entered fashion with the help of La Bomby, a straw hat with about six inches [60 cm] wide, which was seen on all sides, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cartoon brand behind a very inefficient hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag about the size of a dome model that carried it.
A bag of yellow and red with a fur coat with a refire and a white leather handle was the central element of La Rivira's collection of the spring and summer of 2019 brand Jacquemus in the Paris fashion week.
The famous historian Luke Armelze explained to F your father: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the influence of the designer is so great that it is difficult to ignore demand for a permafrosses.
John Edward: knowledge is required for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain high standards of education, and in 2018, they were again receiving excellent tests that complemented individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SNWS), which seeks to provide the best services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, a career they have chosen, and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school choices.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, he will understand it.
If you're talking to her in her own language, she's taking it in her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that in independent schools, language is held in ratings with the best ratings.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages got higher A.
The data collected in 74 SCHS schools showed that 72% of students received a higher price in Chinese, and 72% were students in German, 69% were students in French, and 63% were students in Spanish.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as an object of choice is presented in the same way as NlIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A poll conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons employers cannot close the vacancy associated with lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for a future career.
Since more promising positions require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if someone learned a second language, it's going to have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a few languages priority over competitors.
According to a survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak in foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken in twofold percentages (15%).
That's why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Learning a few languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important languages in Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools it will always be possible to select several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares and arms children with skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment language continues to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youths.
I'll tell you what you're doing.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts from Lakes in San Diego
Fantists who want to see Lebrona James for Los Angeles Lakes started almost arrived.
The Laukers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play on Sunday at the first pre-session match against the Danver Naggetts in San Diego.
How many minutes it's gonna play, it hasn't been resolved yet.
'It will be more than one, and less than 48,' said Walton on the official Lakes website.
Mike Trudell reported that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-separate games in Lakers.
"This stage of my career in preparation, I don't need pre-seasonal games," he replied.
Tramp Myths in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election meetings in the town of Whiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings next week of the Tramp, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate he proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump wants to form support for future mid-term elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time will it take for today’s conference of the Trump in West Virginia, and how can we look at it on the Internet?
Whiling Tramp in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours east of Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online down in the direct air on YouTube.
Trump probably refers to the intensive hearings that took place this week regarding the candidate to the Supreme Court of Britta Cavano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the delay in the vote of the Senate for a week while the FBI is under investigation.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans with their popularity before November elections.
The representatives of President Trump said that these five meetings next week were aimed at “acting volunteers and adherents, since the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of the people they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
“The control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible because the season of the pre-election campaign is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to call his name.
At the Wesbank Arena Stadium, in Uyling today’s meeting, adherents from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
A Saturday visit will be the second in the last month of the Trump visit to West Virginia, where he obtained over 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, who's under polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to raise his rating in surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder's Cube 2018: The U.S. team's set up to fight and hope for Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended in a unilateral victory, the afternoon Sabbath trances can become just what this cup of Rider lacked.
The high - pitched pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse works?
"They've been in front of six points, and now they're four points, so I think we're taking it a little bit as a pulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe prefers, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Stete says, feel a little bit of wind in their sails, too, have much to encourage, not least the form of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everyone has made three points out of four.
A sweat with his killer blows from the Mayan to the granny shows an example.
These larynx cries of celebration became more loud when, as he continued his round, he made a decisive path and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas were left on two points.
His sweat, which allowed them to win the match on 15 holes, met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really should really try hard and worry about your own match," said St.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 Holes to become famous.
The only player with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood — has been the overwhelming story of Rider’s Cup.
An unusual but fascinating couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid god in the morning on Saturday and afternoon on Friday and on the nine last moons on Friday morning.
This race and the way their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and back makes them believe that they will win on Sundays and that there will be no more popular players than Flilwood or Molinari in order to secure a potential victory for Europeans when the sun arrives over Le Golf National.
We want both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of the triumph of Europeans is still early.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson left Sergio Garcia, an officer of morning trout when he was in a match with Alex Noren.
One god and two dates on the first nine holes brought a Spaniard and a Swede into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for trouts and forsams because of the interaction between couples, because of the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and also interesting to see how strategy can change in a single moment.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this fort session has also shown that the U.S. team is going to fight what some, especially Americans, are questioning.
Europe leads with a 10-6 account on the last day of the Rider Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturdays, forbolas and forks, it's ahead of the United States with a 10-6 account.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari has won two victorys over Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who's trying to get the trophies that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning trout with a count of 3-1.
The U.S. won two matches, but it was not able to reduce the breakup.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sundays to keep the trophies.
Flilwood is the first European new girl who won four points in a row, while Mollinari (such as Mulwood) after a sensational weekend is only the second pair, which scored four points in the first four games in the history of the Kutka Ryder.
By destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the forbolas, they united themselves to defeat the proud Wood and the new American Bjoson Deshambo with even more effective 5th.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturdays, showed random bursts of genius, but at the moment, he lost 19 out of 29 of his matches in trout and forsams and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning trout, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the trance to get a 2nd - 1 defeat from Justin Johnson and Brooks Coepki, which is the first and third world ranking.
Europe couldn't do anything in its own way about this nice, fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three times, the chief winner Jordan Spot and Justin Thomas set up a standard for the Americans with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory over the Spaniards by John Ram and Ian Poleter in the forbolas and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLory with a count of 4th3 in the trout, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup, the team returned with a deficit in four points in blues, although the Furick's team only needs a night to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the scaffolding on Sunday seems as if it were beyond their reach.
North Korea says that "no matter" will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was exacerbating mistrust in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had been using “no action of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile trials, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“One, we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the United States, ” he said.
"No trust in the United States will be assured of our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm in unilateral order."
Even though Ri used to repeat familiar North Korea’s complaints about opposition to Washington, D.C., to the denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for its progressive steps, his application was important because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, which was done by the Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong-Inn's joint statement and Donald Trump's first statement in history of loneliness between the real U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for a “ductiveization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump to promise security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea is looking forward to the formal end of the Korean War of 1950 - 53 years, but the United States has declared that the Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to weaken the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on denuclearization first," said Re.
“ It is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, where the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister called attention to three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moone Jong In in the last five months and added: “If the party on this issue of denuclearization would be South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not go into such a dead corner”.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of the other day when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the mainland was inevitable after the "Mr. evil President" Trump called Kim "the man-craket" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to destroy North Korea, commended Kim for the courage to use disarmament measures, but said that much more would have to be done and the sanctions would have to remain in force for the denuclearization of North Korea.
In Wednesday, Trump noted that he didn't set a time limit for this: "This will take two years, three years or five months without meaning."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward the Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. attorney Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and reluctantly until we see total, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has steadily increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding of nuclear programmes and the Phenyun ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly screens and then said that next month he would visit the Pynchian again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented on his progress, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for his “Hangster requirements”.
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to cut down the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States was taking “responsive measures”.
He said that Kim said that he needed the “departures” as security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and the steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year's new Harvard University course provided all its students with more sleep, and it's an effort to combat the growing culture of learning all night after a caffeine supply.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a sleep professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate the course after giving the lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the day, one girl came up to him and said, "Why am I told this now, on the final course?"
“ She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, ” shared the teacher at The Telegraph.
At a course that was first introduced this year, students explain how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barrey, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University of Medicine, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been found that students had been seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one chapter is a picture of a room where students click coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports performances, and the importance of alcohol associated with sleep.
Another chapter describes how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The next map of the interactive icons computer encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking,' added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride over sleep all night still exists, he added, and he noted that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is on the increase.
A sufficient sleep of good quality must be a “separate weapon” of a student to deal with stress, burnout and anxiety, even with a set of unnecessary weight, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hungering mode that causes constant physical hunger, he told us.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other colleges last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole computer.
The next step, he expected, would be to ask all the students to go through a similar program of teaching before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students give reminders of going to bed, as well as offering an alarm clock and being aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and light bulbs, and that it can disrupt the circus rhythm that leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mangie's naked lads are upset by Gerardard's boys
Rangers survived a second bitter attack: Dolly Mangi hit Stephen Gerards in defeat with a 1-0 account from Lovingstone.
The Aybrox team was eager to win its first victory at the exit match after the February triumph over St. Johnston, with a count of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard's second defeat as 18-game manager, and Gerard's team left eight points behind the Scottish Premiersipu Harts.
Menga killed seven minutes before the break, and Ringers, who lacked inspiration, did not look as if it could match the bill.
Now, Rengers's down to sixth position, and Livston went up to the third, and they're only preceded by Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may be faced with another problem, as the lineman Kalum Spencer was forced to cultivate the wound of his head after he had been thrown into the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that once passed the Air into the semi-firmal of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same warehouse "Liv 11", which took one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way that his forcesmen suffocated rivals at every step.
Maybe Reyngers was dominated by the ball, but Lingston worked harder with the ball.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Mangie into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit at the gates of Allan Macgrah, but the semi-protector wasted this great chance of sending the ball past the gate.
The deep free blow of Kegan Jacobs hit Craig Huckett's skin, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, hit the back of his pants.
Rangers really got control, but at the last third, there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been entitled to a penalty of a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lowes, but Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombians.
Rangers succeeded in making only two strikes on the gate in the first Tayma, but Liam Kelly's former Aybrox Gate shot Lassani Kulibili's head and the peaceful blow of Ovier Ejaria almost failed to take care of it.
Although the upper head of Livston may have been in conflict with the course of play for 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserve it only by their hard work.
Rangers failed to handle Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng to just finish.
During the break, Gerard replaced the Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the Vincent tried to get to Morelos, but this amazing Kelly was punctuating from his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play a game that they like when Litgo and Hulkette make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved performance in the last stages, but McGurgor was good at resisting Jacobs before Litgo hit the corner.
Glenn Middton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson looked again.
Almanach, the inventor of Geiger's counter
And now the page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, this day, and time goes... in Germany, was born by a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Guangger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's accounts have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, the 1950s Coronado film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable views of cowboys.
Man: "What's all this?
Rogers: “This is Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear what the effects of radiation in minerals are on the atoms."
Evans, "Well, well, it's really breaking up right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.

And then these cells are able to watch protein, which is common to many types of cancer, and then they're brought back to the patient.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that these cells can be “seed” for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-entering these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzosski of the United States National Cancer Institute of Betezda, Maryland, observed: “Our results show that we received a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 "makes several types of cancer grow," he explained, including breast cancer, ovarians, lung and color cancer.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “instructing” them to target cancer cells, worked to treat one of the leukemia.
Upon appearing in the study of the SNL show at the MAGA baseball station Kanier West, a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
Why Calling for a Negative Response
The students in the study of the SNL show (Sunday Night in the Direct Efire) edified Kanier after his solemn performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and claimed that he would be fighting for presidential office in 2020.
After a third song, called the Ghost Tower, in a baseball station with the inscription, "Let's Back America's Former Glory," he burst into a tyrant in which he was loathing the democracies, and again declared his support of the Trump.
"Of course, sometimes white people ask me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned with racism, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL started off with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Bretta Cavano's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on the summons of Christine Blaise Ford about sexual assault.
Although the West was not broadcast directly in the air, the video with its tyrant was made into social networks by a comedian named Chris Rock.
Whether Rock wanted to ridicule the West by placing it in place is unclear.
Also, the West complained to the spectators, who had a bad situation behind the scenes, because of the main set.
As Washington Examiner reports, the West stated, "When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
They said, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball game."
They've been kidding me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the downtrodden are silent."
And you go on and say, "Do you want to see a place where the downtrodden are quiet, I'll put my baseball superman on, because nobody can tell me what to do, and you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat one another with love."
According to the Variety weekly, his comments at least twice called the negative response of the audience in the hall, and the SNL agents looked like they were broken, and one of the audience said, "The studio has a dead silence."
The West was invited to replace Arian Grande, a singer whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the airship.
The West caused a lot of surprise to do the song I Love It (I like it) in the Perrier's suit of water bottles.
The West supported the head of the conservative TPUSA Kends Turner, who wrote in Twitter, "One of the boldest, one of them."
Instead, the conductor, Karen Gunter, wrote on Twitter that the West "is what he is, and it's just great."
"I will not reward him, either by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art," who, I think, is practicing and distorting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, a rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, and now he's "who used to be known as Kanier West."
The West is not the first performer to change his name, he's following the example of Diddy, also known as Paff Dedey, Paffy, and Piode.
Now, Snup Dogg had previously been called Snope Lion, and the music legend of recent decades is known to Princes has changed his name in symbol, and then became "Aratist, formerly known as Prince."
Prosecution of attempted murder after assault at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a knife wounding another man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident occurred at the Belligecmore restaurant.
The accused is expected to be tried on Monday by Belfast Masters.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is in charge.
Kit Herington condemns the idealization of brutality
Heerington's whale became famous because of the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval pheasy series "The Mountain of the Thrones" of the production of HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor who condemned the characterization of the Macho hero, claiming that through such heroes on the screens, young boys often seem to have to be cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that, in his opinion, " something went wrong," and asked how to address the idealization of violence in the age of the hashtag's popularity #MeTo's protuse, #ie, etc.
A whale who had recently married his Green House colleague, the 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said that he was "slowly determined" to deal with the problem.
"I am now set up to be quite decisive, when have we come upon a slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their grown-ups because of the shadow of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing violence because of images of unusually courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What is natural, and what are we born into?
Why does television and the street teach youths that they feel pressured to be such men?
I think today is a really important question, "How do we change this?"
It's obvious that young guys have got out of the way."
He also pointed out in the interview that it would not take place in any of the bakeries and the "Gree thrones" skates after the show was completed next summer, because "the battles and the horses are finished."
From November, Kit's going to play the "The Right West" play of Sam Shepard -- the story of the film producer and his brother-in-law.
As an actor recently admitted, he respects the meeting with his wife, Rose, the best thing he's ever had to do with "The Top of the Thrones" series.
"By the time of the filming in this show, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my life to come," said Kit.
In the fentesy series that got the reward for Emma, Rose played Igrit, the love of the hero, John Snow.
A couple were married in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China claims a sharp increase of 14% in new diseases
In China, 14 per cent of citizens with HIV and AIDS reported a sharp increase.
As reported by the health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people worldwide.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the trend.
For a long time, in some regions, China’s HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, official health officials at a conference held in Yunnan said that the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China has grown by 100,000 compared with the previous year.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for China's LGBT.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT is often discriminated against.
According to a study, 70 - 90 percent of men who have sex with other men continue to marry women because of domination in the country of conservative values.
Most cases of transmission are due to improper use of means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free access to HIV drugs, seeing part of the solution.
Maxine Beters denies the discharge of the data of the relic senators on the network by her regular employee, and gives a sharp "unsafe lie" and "conspiracy theory."
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Watters, denounced the voting statements that one of her regular employees had posted the personal data of three U.S. Presidents on their pages in Wikipedia.
Democracy from Los Angeles claims that these statements spread to political audiences and websites.
"Break, lie, and then an even more disgusting lie," Weters said in Twitter.
It is reported that the information published contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Götsch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from Capitol while listening to the Senate Commission for charges of sexual assaults against Britta Cavano, a candidate for the office of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The flow of data occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedStet, there was information that the source IP was linked to the office of Tuters and was able to locate the data of its staff member.
"These baseless statements are absolutely not true, they're not true," continued Wetters.
"The employee of my office, whose personal data and security are threatened by these fabricated and lying claims, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely false, they don't match reality."
The application was quickly unveiled, and among others was a former White House press secretary, Ari Fleescher.
"It's a denial full of anger," Fleether wrote.
"This suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need for anger.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmovable."
It looks like Flyscher was doing parallels between the Weters response and the democratic critic at Judge Kavano's address, who was accused of looking too angry at the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is fighting to take the Beters for the results of the mid - election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is the news, if it's all true," he wrote.
In his statement, Weters noted that her office had already reported "the responsible State authorities and the law enforcement authorities on these false claims."
"We will do all we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered before the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all of my employees."
Agent Johnny Ingleish: A New Mission is an out-of-the-way parody of spying with Roven Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look for in every new British movie the laughs of Brexit, and they're in a new part of a series of comedian poplars on Johnny Ingleish, the first movie called "Johnny Ingles" was released back in 2003, and later the series was re-established in 2011, with "Johnny Ingleish: Restart."
Will it be a ridiculous, ironic self-responsibility that we're wrong, a new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingleish with his moving face and his blind eyes, the second time he was given the opportunity to create a mess with his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
Johnny is, as we know, a heartless secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit from the Cluzo inspector, a little bit from Mr. Bina and a lot of things -- from that guy who played one note of the song with the film "Walking chariots" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The type of character is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that always left behind a mess that Atkinson once played in the long forgotten television ads of Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Inglesha, there are some nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingleish, in his knighty armor, was approaching a helicopter, and his helmet was sung by his shovels.
It's a very good idea to discover Atkinson's talent to set up a sandwich, but humor is going through, and in some cases it's too much, especially if you compare it to "serious" movies like Agent 007 and "Micsia is impossible," one of the comedys who also have come from the comedy.
It seems like jokes are designed more for children than for adults, and I don't think I'm going to be as creative and thoughtful as Atkinson do in the dumb Binna movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Great Britain.
In the British supercrete network of spies, hackers cross and reveal the names of all the field agents, which became a complete surprise for the current agent. (Aldon, unfortunately, only played an epidetic role in the film.)
This turned out to be the last theft for the prime minister, a haughty person who has already experienced a devastating criticism and depression because of a lack of popularity. ( Emma Thompson tried to convey the image of Theresa May to the fullest extent possible, but the script failed to reveal it fully.)
The intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she had to get someone behind her.
The choice falls on the awkward Johnny Ingles, who now works as a teacher at some super-divided institution, and does not officially teach children to work undercover (this part of the spy school for Ingles was a few successful jokes for teenagers).
Inglers are quickly taken to Whitegol for a term briefing, where he reconvenes with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is also playing Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine captain (the rock of an exaltated man does not exactly correspond to Vicki Pepperdin’s talent).
So when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to take a scooter, Betman and Robin come back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistoletov, who's playing Olga Curilenko.
And at that time, the prime minister goes into the magic of a charismatic billionaire who made his fortune in technology and technology and claimed that he can solve the problem with the British network, which is the evil Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Ingleish and Buff are on their way and again resort to their ridiculous ways: overcooked waiters, they fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad to Volta's luxurious pit; Ingleish sets up a real mess when he tries to use virtual reality helmet to find out how to plan Volta's house.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but by his kindness and violence, he is like a movie for children.
I'm going through a movie.
Like watching other movies about Johnny Ingles, I asked myself the same question: Can the British movie industry not offer Rowe Atkins an role that really corresponds to his talent?
Leiborists deny the preparation of the plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
The Lesborist Party Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan that allows the British to work four days a week, but they're going to get a salary in five days.
It is reported that the Party wants to commit company leaders to hand over the money saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, to the employees, giving them an extra exit.
So the workers will have a three - day weekend, and they'll bring home the same wage.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the Party's economic program and directs the country's resources to support the labour force.
The four-day workday shift was approved at the British Congress of the Tundinion, and it is expected that workers will be able to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
The source of the Labour Party reported the Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-day work week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as to the Party's overall industrial strategy."
The winners didn't first approve of this idea, because the Green Party promised to have a four-day workweek in the pre-election campaign of 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at present approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The Party's political program doesn't have four-day workweek implementation, so we don't look at this idea right now."
"Tier" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election convention of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was determined to take back power from the "no-one directors" of the utilities and the "receivers."
The shadow chancellor plan also means that shareholders of water supply companies may not get all their share of capital if the Labour Administration sets up a "accounting" on the basis of imaginary disruptions.
He also confirmed the intention to include workers before the company leadership and to create inclusive stock funds to transfer 10% of the usual shares of private sector firms to employees who are looking forward to annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell the 60 Minutes (60 minutes) whether they can investigate the case of Cavano, which leads the FBI, change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Britt Kawano, who conducts the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge is postponed for at least a week, asking whether the Republican senators will continue to support Kawano after the results of the investigation have been made public.
In a Sunday show of 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked the Rectors John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges occurred and came out, asked him, “Did you really do that?”
He was firm, firm, uncompetentious."
The thought of Graham seems to make no difference.
"I believe that the presentation of Kawano's charges is provocation," he said.
"Doctor Forde, I don't know what happened, but I know that: Brittat strongly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford. --
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what's going to happen."
What is Global Capital Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Capital Festival of Festivals — an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally dramatic mission — to eradicate global poverty.
During the seventh Global Urban Festival, there are tens of thousands of people in the Biglands of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Hardy B, and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival – the organizers want to eradicate the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
Global Urban Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Trust Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to an event (only if you don't want to pay VIP ticket), visitors have to do a bunch of jobs or "works", like learning in a volunteer project, write an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else to help draw attention to the aim of the organization -- poverty eradication.
So, is there any result, because in order to achieve the goal, the Global Capital has been left for 12 years?
Is it really the idea to reward a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "cyclativeism" where people feel that they really change things by signing an electronic petition or by making a Twitter publication?
Since 2011, according to Global City, they have recorded 19 million "works" of their supporters to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have caused world leaders to declare their planned financial suspensions and programs worth more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited the results of its 390 financial commitments and public applications, with at least 10 billion already being collected and lost.
According to estimates by the group, funding has already directly affected the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
One of the major financial commitments is the Food Power Foundation, which is theoretically related to Britain, which, under the framework of the project, investors and renaissors made commitments to help children grow up and promised to help Rwanda 35 million dollars to cope with malnutrition after they received more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Cities.
"In support of the British government, comets, governments, and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," stated the representative of the University of Nutrition Tracy Wallman, speaking in front of the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “works” that had called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government had announced the allocation of funds for the Food of Nutrition project, aimed at improving the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global Citilen wrote this, "This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we'll fall down and fail.
But, like civil rights activists and anti-apartheids, we're going to be successful because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Hardy B, Gianelle Mona is just a part of the star performers who will be present at the New York Festival this year, and will be led by Deborah-Le Fernes and Guy Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs claimed that the United States could use naval forces to use clouds to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to the U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted at Washington Examiner, "for necessity", Washington can seek the help of the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including Middle Eastern markets.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria’s conflict, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy plants.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to mediate in energy, as in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the executive, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy's virtues can ensure free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian power does not enter the market," he said.
He spoke to participants in the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that views itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
Then he compared the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy effectively and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "universally developed," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
As these claims echoed, the Trump administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing out of the Russian electricity market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
President Donald Trump himself is trying to convince the German government to abandon the “inefficient” project to build the “North Flow 2” that, according to Trump, will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the “North Stream 2, worth $11 billion and double the capacity of the existing gas to reach 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cu m], is an extremely economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington strongly opposes the project for economic reasons, as an example of dishonest competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and consumer pressure to choose suppliers," stated Russian energy minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with U.S. Minister of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support of the project.
The German leading German Federal Union (BDI) called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like when the third country interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federal Union, after the last meeting of German chancellor Angelie Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will seriously think of the pore of Presidentship in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that "seriously think" about the election of the president after the intermediate election.
During a public meeting in the city of Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a possible withdrawal.
And as The Hill Warren said, "There's time for women to go to Washington to set up a government job, and there's got to be a woman on his head for that."
"I'm going to think seriously, after 6th November, about putting my candidature on the presidency."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his assessment of Donald Trump's presidency, stating that he would "take his country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was honest in his criticism of Trump and his offer of a candidate as a Supreme Court judge, Britta Kawano.
On Friday's Twitter, Warren wrote, "It's clear that before the FBI vote, an investigation should take place."
However, according to a survey published on Friday, most voters do not think that they should be fighting in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Saffolck Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of potential Massachusetts voters spoke against the senator's nomination.
Thirty - two percent supported the release.
The survey found that former Governor Delal Patrick was more supportive and that 38 percent of him was said to be president, against 48%.
In the course of the discussions on the candidates for other well-known democracies, which can be held in 2020, it is also called former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Baiden claimed to make a decision before January.
Sarah Peylin refers to the PTSD Trek Paylin during a meeting in support of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after entering the military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is doing right now, what he's going through after his return, can only understand the other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said in front of the meeting to support Donald Trump in the city of Tals, Oklahoma.
Peylin called Treck's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention" and said that her son and other war veterans "come home not as they used to be, more brutal, and want to know if they've respected what their soldiers, pilots and other military forces have done for this country."
According to the police director of Vassilla, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Mondays in Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as obstructing the news of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and districts in Colombia support protection policies
Eight states and a district of Colombia support a new policy in the United States that denies refugee status to victims of banditry and domestic violence.
According to the NBC News, 18 states and districts sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support a lawsuit that needs shelter and is being prosecuted in court order for this policy.
The full name of the lawsuit in the Grace v. Sashens case for the American Civil Rights Union, in which the federal policy was challenged and which was filed in August, is not open.
The positionwoman said that her partner and his cruel and thug sons beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20th.
She was held illegally in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace's lawsuits stated that residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (often seeking asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status cancels the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, according to which non-documented immigrants could request asylum.
General Carl Reisin, general prosecutor of Columbia, stated during his Friday speech that the new policy “has ignored decades of state, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that the decision to apply for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set forth in such a statement, and the prohibition is in violation of this principle” is based on a court consultant's analytic note.
Then, in an analytical record, prosecutors argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States harms the economy because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and fill the necessary labour resources.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sachens issued an order for immigration judges, stating that they were no longer able to grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," said Sashens during the presentation of politics on June 11.
The purpose of providing shelter was never to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers desperately try to find those who have survived, while the number of people killed in Palm has doubled.
For those who survive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming down her boy with a fever at the evacuation center of the destroyed town of Pal.
"Every minute quick help brings the bodies in.
Clean water is not enough."
Some people return to their destroyed homes, take over their underground belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake, with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were full.
Some of the wounded, including two Heris, with his back and shoulders broken, rest near the building of the army hospital in Palm, where patients are given help under the open sky because of repeated shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how a strong push had pushed the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
I think I've been stuck in the debris of the wall," told Hers correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to town for a wedding.
'I heard my wife beg for help, and then came over the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of having "surpassed psychological pressure" by means of "recurring propaganda,"
A week after the American daily publication of advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the United States Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday went to China Daily's China edition in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after having accused China of influencing elections to Congress on November 6th, and China rejects these charges.
According to the Reuters Agency, U.S. officials, the Trump statements that he accuses Beijing of interference in American elections mean a new phase of escalation from Washington, D.C., which is aimed at pressures on China.
Although foreign governments may place ads to activate trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, where they have already taken up imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive artist in China was not intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republic Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, United States Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China, said that China was hurting American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstad wrote in the Sunday release column of Des Moines Register, "encourages the pressure to publish advertising that contains propaganda in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of free speech and press independence for the American people, by posting a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"In contrast, on street schedules here in Beijing, you will only look for individual voices of dissenters, and you won't see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is a cause of concern, which you can conclude that China's media are under the safe control of the China Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it.
Analytics warn that in the case of Javano, Republican women are setting up elections against themselves before elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge, Britta Kawano, after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an undesirable reaction to the upcoming elections, especially in women.
Around this situation are passions, and most Republicans publicly claim to want to turn to voting.
Such things can't just go back," said in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science Maxwell Searow University School.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, where Senator Jeff Flake (republic of Arizona) was urged in the last minute, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
As reported in Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and reader of the progressive MoveOn group, Catherine Jean-Pierre on Friday, said, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protestors were singing "Lostfall is coming!" during a demonstration on the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to confirmation of the Kavano candidate, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview on Stew Rotenberg's news website, an out-of-party political viewer said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"It's said that's right now, and that's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in women voters from 18 to 29 years of age who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford gave a witness in connection with the charges of being a Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, the analysts predicted the negative reaction of the voters if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
As NBC News reports, earlier this week former president of the National Committee of the National Party, Michael Steele, said, "It's a bad story for the Republican Party."
As Guy Cesel pointed out in an interview with the news channel director of the states (U.S.P.) (U.S.R.) (contributing to the campaign of democracy) "is not in the vote of the committee, the final vote, or the fact that Kawano was on the dock of the defendants, but in the way that they responded to the situation and how they acted further."
However, the thinking of the Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavano, has been divided, and a little bit more is for Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41 percent of respondents believe or more in the testimony of Ford, while Kawano’s testimony suggests that 35 percent of the respondents believe or more quickly believe in it.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Kawano was giving or most likely to give false testimony, while Ford said the same thing to 30 percent of those surveyed.
According to The Guardian, the FBI, after urging Flake, conducts an examination of Ford’s charges and another advocate, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under oath to the Senate Legal Committee about how Kawano attacked her while she was in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
Ramírez claimed that a candidate for the Supreme Court had shown her his genitals at a party during their university studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The Internet inventor plans to run a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, starts a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is to develop an open-sourced Solid, the idea of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users will be able to select where to store data and who to access information from.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, it was joked that the purpose of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about the startup. "
It's a historical moment."
The application uses the Solid technology that allows users to create an `interactive online repository' or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, lists of current items, calendars, a library of audio recordings, and other tools for your use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Space in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online repository is that it fully responds to the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities by means of data."
According to Director General Inrut John Bruce, the company has the goal of investing resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform built at IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team didn't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models were going to change dramatically in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission was to “safe the commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrut Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and Director of the World Wide Web Assembly, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistic about the next stage of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration for the Church’s Church’s delivery of the Cross Victoria Order in the years of World War I
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the order of Cross Victoria for fighting during World War I, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded for his participation in the attic under Belings and Leocure on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from a snipe bullet, never learning that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it super symbolic, that the discovery of a memorial stone took place 100 years after his grandfather made a feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion across the Saint Katin Canal, “the fog of very thick and under heavy fire of Polish cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he hurried towards the fire and with “vigorous courage ” led the three front, one to the left cannon, and destroyed three cannons of enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German Sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did something that he could never have repeated and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Bruntwood Manual Bynd.
Michael Vann said, "It's very proud of being part of this parade," and he added that "the real hero's courage is showing him the honor of so many people."
MMA's fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown "Pep's Beetle"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to see the event-rich Bellatar 206 tournament, and you're denied the opportunity to review the main event.
The San José Tournacs, which was held in San José, showed 13 battles, including six main programs that were broadcast during the night in Britain in 5 channels.
At 6: 00 a.m., just before Gegaard Musasey and Rory McDonald were prepared to come together, the British TV viewers died out of wonder when the battle appeared on the screen, instead of broadcasting, the pepa pig.
Some spectators were not excited about this because they did not sleep until early in the morning waiting for the battle.
One fan wrote in Twitter that switching to children's cartoons seemed to him "anything to be a bad joke."
"As decided by the government of content that was broadcast at 6: 00 a.m., it was not appropriate, so they were forced to let a child transfer," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Public Relations, when asked about the television program,
"Pep's pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Cocker promised to work on a broadcast schedule to capture viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think that if we talk about retranslation, we can do it," said Coucker.
"Please, it's Sunday, 6 o'clock in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have a Sunday, and they're Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we got a lot of messages that we answered, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical fault, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, this proved to be a lack of compliance with government rules.
I can promise you that no more of this will happen.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to send a signal to the fans, but we've been delaying these attempts.
It's really a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daly, the Olympic jumper, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that he wasn't all like him until he went to high school.
In his participation in the transfer of Desert Island Discs to Rado 4 by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he had made a frank statement about the gay rights to give "departure" to others.
He also claimed that because of his fatherhood, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The manager, who had been running the program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to a hospital for several months.
When she came to Leverne's first program, Daly said that she felt worse than others when she was a child, because "the community didn't feel when a boy and a girl loved someone."
He said, "So far, the sense of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that there was something "watchman" that would not disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
Two-time bronze Olympics became a famous LBGT-soldier and took advantage of this year's partnership games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was honest about his views, because he felt happy that he could live in an open place without any consequences, and wanted to give it to others.
The world’s three - time champion admitted that the feelings of a man, American filmmaker Justin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Daly and the Oscar laureate, who was 20 years old, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at this young age" (at the first Olympics he was at age 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have survived the same rise and fall.
In June, the couple had a son called Robert Rey Blacke Deiley, and from then on, according to Dale, his "education" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think about getting gold," he said.
"You know, there are things that are far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father could not accept the end and asked if they had bought tickets for the London Olympics 2012 because they wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't sit in the front row because you're not going to be around," he told Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not infallible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I knew that was what I wanted all my life to dream about: diving before my fellow countrymen at the Olympics, and I didn't feel any better than that," said Daly.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Gordium) in the execution of Hiser Smol – which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still stirs up ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 English summer time.
On Saturday, Mickelson, who wasn't in uniform, was taken out of the T-shirt for the Rider Cup.
American Phil Mikelson sets up a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tournament game for "The Coke of Ryder," but he has to restore his form so that he won't be unhappy with this event.
Michaelson, who's been involved in a high-level tournament that takes place once every two years, got Captain Jim Furick out of the game for the time of the trout and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-year-old winner cheered up the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to control the emotions.
Because Michaelson wasn't famous for even being on the side of his career, a 48-year-old athlete didn't fit the hardfield of Le Golf National, where Rapha is usually punished for wandering.
And if it's not that far from the field, at the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet with a champion of the Open Championship and an accurate hit by Francesco Molinari, who won all of his matches this week in the match with his new friend Tommy Flyllwood.
If the Americans who drop off on three points after 12 single matches do well to start, Mickelson's match may be decisive.
He expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped me on his back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow would be ready," said Furick.
"He's no doubt in his power.
Michaelson is a member of the fame hall, which has done so much for teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play at two matches.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's what happened, and so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field, like anybody else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, he's going to beat Nick Falldo's record, which's the biggest game ever played at the Coke Ryder.
This is where he can finish his career at "The Buck Rider," which has never met his individual achievements.
In Michaelson's account, 18 beats, 20 defeats, and 7 outcomes of the night, but Furick said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's exhausted, he's funny, he likes to have fun with others, he's a guy that's cool to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time finding it, and this week, and watching it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that a big break-off doesn't decide anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a tangible break-in to the solitary matches of the last day's tournament for the Coke of Rider is not yet a guaranteeer of victory.
Dutch debuted in 1997 at a game in Valderram Club, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans in five points, but won the match with a slight break with a result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big breakoff in Valderram's field; a big breakoff in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram's field where we won," said Bjorn after watching the winning games "Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10.6.
So history teaches me and every team player that's not solved yet.
We'll have to play with maximum pay tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need.
The game will be completed only after the result is displayed on the tab.
We have the goal of getting this trophie, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're well aware of who's against us, the best players in the world."
Bjorn said, "I'm never going to run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can do differently.
And tomorrow we're expected to have individual matches, and that's something else.
It's great to play the field with your partner when everything's going well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can check on what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how players are configured tomorrow: at the limits of opportunity.
You're leaving your partner without support, and now he's also supposed to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, opposite Jim Furick expects his partners to play better on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spate and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
By Furick's very way back on the last day, he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when the team from Europe created "The Truth in Medina."
'I remember every bloody word,' he said in reply to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, had organized players before the last day of the contest.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to start successfully, as was the case in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the initiative moves on to someone’s side, the middle - distance players face a special pressure.
We put the players in the teams, like we're going, like, to do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is charged with trying to lead the counterattack against Rory Mackilroy, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poleter on the first half of the European teams.
"The partners themselves, and in that order I chose because I wanted to share my efforts evenly throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players in individual games.
The introduction of a new German warship was postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be put into action in 2014 instead of the old Cold War warships, but according to local media, this is not going to happen by at least the next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the rapid increase in spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, obtained from the director of the military, the introduction of a ship called the Rangeland Pfaltz, the main ship of a series of the most modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, is postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was about to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery had affected the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, which were ordered by the naval army in 2007, have to replace the old frigate of the Bremen class.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some technologies that will reduce the visibility of, among other things, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of maintenance, and it is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
But journalists Die Zeit warn that due to the constant delay in over-modern warships that would increase Germany’s military power in the sea, at the time of entry into exploitation, they will also become obsolete.
A large frigate of F125 fell into the headlines last year when German naval forces officially refused to enter into action and returned it to Blohm + Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of a ship’s shipbuilding company upon delivery.
Few of the reasons for the return are known, but German media have mentioned the significant “delicts of software and equipment” that have made the warship impossible to carry out military operations.
The challenges of software are of particular importance, because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class crew is made up of about 120 sailors -- only half the number of military personnel who served in the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been discovered that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, making its operational characteristics worse and limiting the possibility of further modernization.
It is believed that the Reynland Pfitz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) for vessels of the same class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to inadequate equipment, another problem has been the cumulative cost of the project, which also includes the cost of crew preparation.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have become a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion United States dollars).
The problems of obtaining new frigates were particularly significant in light of recent warnings of the collapse of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, the Bundestag of the Hans-Peter Bartels Armed Forces reported that the Navy had “nearly few ships capable of carrying out combat tasks”.
The driver claimed that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for some time, since the old ships had been released from exploitation and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret at the fact that none of the frigate of the Badden-Württemberg class was able to fill the Navy.
The National Trust will observe the bat’s secret life
A new study on land tenure in Scotland is designed to determine how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Researchers hope that the data they receive will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in the future.
In Invertere Gardens in Wester Ross, scientists in the National Trust in Scotland will observe species such as the potato netopian and the pygmy netopian, as well as the ears of a simple and watery night.
Special check-ups will be located in strategic land areas to observe bats behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers in the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
An experimental analysis of all recorded sounds will help determine the frequency and relevance of bat calls.
Then it's going to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser in the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the results of the research will help determine which habitats are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (e.g. tree formation) and determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bats have been greatly reduced in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and disposal of areas that deprive them of their nesting grounds.
Other negative factors include winding machines and lighting, glue paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and attacks on cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, nighttime hunting makes their ears more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacle flight trajectories.
In Scotland, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres [760,000 ha] of land throughout the country, the problem of bats is a serious one.
Ten trained experts regularly conduct research, site testing, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even been made to create the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in the Trive site in the Damfried-and-Ghallova region, where it has eight of the 10 species of bats that live in Scotland.
Dr. Thompson's office manager says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the territory of Trives, excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need a lot of information about bats, and the research that we're doing here and elsewhere will help us learn more about what's needed for them to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check areas for bats before any technical work is done, since the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the breeding of the young may cause up to 400 females with their young, likely causing the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law, and animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrella, an officer at the Scottish bat conservation center, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers prepare lawsuits against the German edition
Krystian Ronald called the charges of rape as "nocle" and claimed that people were "inclined to draw attention to themselves," using his name.
His attorneys are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newsmagel Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspicions.
American Catherine Major accused the Portugual Cable and the Juventus football club of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to De Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldda allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the charges of 33-year-old Ronalddo were filed with 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video-translation, calling them "noble."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slanders, and this is the statement made by the five-year-old Lord Golden Sufficient on the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people are trying to pressure me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," added a football player, smiling.
According to Reuters Lawyers, Ronaldda's attorneys are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges that they call "unforeseeable reports of suspicion in private life."
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that a football player would claim compensation for “moral damage in size which represents a serious breach, which is probably one of the worst cases of personal rights violations in recent years”.
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Ronaldda and Major Club, he returned to the player’s room where he allegedly raped her, which was referred to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Major claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell on his knees and said that he was "99 percent good guy" who was raised by "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldda confirmed that he had sex with the model, but according to mutual consent.
Majora also claims that she went to the police station, and then to the hospital where her injuries were taken, but later she agreed to a pre-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and avoided “public humiliation”.
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous agreement because she continues to suffer from an incident that she said had a place to do.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the FK “Real Madrid” from the FK of Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the Italian football grant, the Justice team, for 100 million euros.
Great Britain's "decently sorry" for the loss of automotive manufacturers.
Great Britain is always going to regret if you lose the status of world automotive leader after Brexit, and the minister of economics, Greg Clarke, is warned about it.
He added that he was moved by a statement made by the UK TOYT, who told the BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would be forced to suspend the production and work of its factory in Bernaton near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clarke assures us.
A Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the effects of a delay on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The construction in Bernaton, where Auris and Avense, U.S.A., was made of about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, director general of Toythar in Bernaton.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit to the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the mini model factory at Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fear of automotive manufacturers is that Brexit, without an agreement, can pose risks to supply chains.
The Toyta production line is operating in quick supply mode for details and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for companies on demand.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be delays in the supply of details at the border, leading to delays and shortages of materials.
And as they say in the company, you can put more than one day in Toyota's warehouse, so you're going to have to stop manufacturing.
Greg Clarke noted that in terms of establishing a relationship with the EU by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), “there are also schemes for avoiding problems at the border”.
"We need a deal, we need to make the best agreement, which I think will not only be able to succeed at this moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the program Today at the BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of the representatives of Toyjune company, as well as of other automotive manufacturers, we need to preserve the well-formed supply chains."
The company of Toyta has been unable to tell how long production will be stopped, but in the long run it is expected that increased spending will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and make jobs easier.
Peter Ciliris, head of Unte's professional company at a factory in Bernaton, which has been working here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can tell you from experience that reduced jobs are not being renovated."
The representative of the government said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The encounter of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, marked in the White House
According to representatives of the White House on Sunday, the responsible meeting with the Deputy Attorney-General of Rod Rosenstein can be “put back for a week” while the discussions are held on the case of Britta Cavano's candidature as a Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of the Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's intervention in the election, the connections between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential interference with justice from the President.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., we are discussing the possibility of the release of a deputy prosecutor who would jeopardize Muller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had expressed himself about using microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of bringing President's 25th Amendment powers to a halt.
Stanstein did not confirm this information.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House on a background report that the official was about to retire.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that he would not want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a time-bound meeting with the Senate Legal Committee, where she was to give a witness to Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump arranged to conduct a weekly FBI investigation of charges against Kavano, which further denied the Senate vote.
Professor Trampa, Sarah Sanders, went to Fox News Sunday television show.
And she said to a question about a meeting with Rosenstein, and she said, "This meeting is not scheduled, maybe it will take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'll keep an eye on the press for the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct media bombings in the White House since September 10.
The leader, Chris Walles, asked why.
Sanders replied that it wasn't often about the bruffings that were not connected to "the public game" by television reporters, although he added, "I won't be able to deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, adding, without referring to the source, "Statist speaks for himself."
Sanders pointed out that the briefing is going to be done anyway, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the U.S. President, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate with the press a lot, and it's going to be particularly visible over the last few weeks, and the opportunity to talk to the U.S. President is no worse than a press conference."
The tramp answers questions regularly while taking steps outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, how he treats journalists scattered and sometimes oddly.
The Scottish State Secretary of Health addressed a letter to employees from the EU in connection with the fears caused by Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health, in a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work at the National Health Service in Scotland, expressed appreciation for their work and asked to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already made commitments to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman stated: “It was during the summer that the British/EU negotiations on the issue of exit continued, and the autumn must be decided upon.
But the British government is increasing preparations for a possible solution without an agreement.
I know that this period can be very disturbing to you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I value the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the health services for the patients and the communities that we serve.
Scotsnia is your home, we want you to stay very much."
Christian Ebercrombie’s surgery after head injury
Christio Ebercrombie's head injury to the Sunday match against Vanderbit Comodorez, who his team lost with an account at 31:27, reported Tennessean.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline, where he got bad," said Reed.
According to a side line of training and medical personnel, Ebercrombie was given oxygen before it was taken to carry out further testing.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers informed Chris Harris of WSMV, Nasville, that Ebercrombie was operating at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added, "until there's any evidence of the type and severity of the trauma."
Abercrombie, second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the team of Illinois.
He's done five catch-ups on Sunday, before he gets out of the game, so he's got 18 interceptions in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay more government customs if they buy their real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more duty if they buy their real estate in Britain. According to Tori's new plans, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This event is neutralizing all Corbin's efforts to involve young voters
Higher government customs will be met by those who do not pay taxes in Britain
In the Ministry of Finance, it is hoped that an additional £120 million will be spent a year helping the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying the U.K. real estate will pay more tax, and additional expenses will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to engage young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The increase in customs will involve both physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who have to sleep under the open sky.
An additional item, accompanied by a two - year - old rise in the second residence and real estate assigned to rent, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected.
According to experts, 13 percent of the new estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream about their own home.
Many wealthy areas of the country, particularly in the capital city, are abandoned because a large number of foreign buyers live most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the lowering of the state customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large building companies of supporting high-price real estate by purchasing land without continuing to use it.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and loss of eviction without good reason.
He also suggests expanding the authority of the local council on the construction of a new home.
Theresa May said, " Last year, I promised that I would be better off in my career of restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross, "Too to be the lead trainer of Scotland's congregation."
Jack Ross, the chief trainer of the UK Sundland, says that "over everything wants" to ever lead the Scottish congregation.
A 42-year-old Scottish man was going to re-establish a club from the north-east of the country, which is now in the third place in the First soccer League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to Stedium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the St. Merren to the Prime League of Scotland.
"I wanted to picture my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second collection room, but it's over," said Ross during the Sportsund program at the BBC State Radio Station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of collecting Scotland at the Hampden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful in the post of chief coach of the club."
Ross's predecessors to the Sundland FK, including Dick Lawyer, David Mys, Sam Ellardace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Piet, and Paolo De Canio.
Former chief trainer FK "Alloa Atleit" claims that he did not feel nervous about moving to a big club to follow such authoritative names, previously rejecting the proposals from the Banksley FK and the Ipswich Town.
"At this point I'm going to think that I'm successful if the club comes back to the Prime League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical support, this club no doubt corresponds to the level of Premier League,” he remarked.
"It's a difficult task, but I don't think I'm going to be successful."
Ross only builds a coach's career for three years, and he worked as a second trainer at the Dambaratton FK, and he spent 15 months at the FK Training Staff, "Garts."
Then he helped Alola get around after the FK got to the third couch, and in the next season, St. Merren went from the exit stage to the title of the winners of the first couch.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at the C.C. "C.", "Cleid," "Gharlpool," "Folkerk," "St. Mirren" and "Gamlton Academy."
"I was on the roadside," he recalls, referring to the move to the Alola FK.
"I sincerely believed that the coaching work was more suitable for me than for the game.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, well earned, and reached a certain height.
But playing is very difficult.
There are many difficulties that each week can be overcome.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a master trainer, I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable in all my adult life as I've ever chosen this career."

Research: 17:30 Sunday — An Ideal Time for Beers ’ Hat
The summer’s heat has helped increase the profit to British pubs, who are not the best of times, but have increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 percent, while the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business advice, observed: "The sun's weather gifts and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July passed the same pattern as the previous month, when the pavilion was raised by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants went even worse.
The black drop of 1.8 percent in July was increasing.
Pabi and bares, which are about drink-oriented, so far as they have the best indicators -- increasing their income is equal to the loss of restaurants.
Pabi, who are served with food, has also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It looks like the only thing that's interested in visitors is drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent a month, and the sale of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the Free and Intelligent Business Department in RSM, observed: "All these trends have been observed since the end of April.
Weather and massive social or sports events remain the main factors that affect sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their income. The annual decline of sales by 4.8% is a major concern over the need to reduce costs.
The long heat of the summer is not the best time for food-to-food facilities, and we'll see if the moderater temperature we saw in August can give them such rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing of new brands to market.
The Galileo sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, Bares and Restaurants sector in Britain is a reflection of the collected and analysed performance of 47 working groups, whose combined trade exceeds 9 billion pounds. This is a commonly accepted industry standard.
Every five children have a social network account hidden from their parents
According to the research, 1 out of every 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, is hidden from parents and teachers in social networking accounts
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of false pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about possible sexual placement
20% of students reported having a "core account" to show parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account on social networks that conceals from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of false pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photos.
The news raised concerns about possible sexual placement.
20% of students reported having a clean "core" account to show parents, as well as one or more private.
The mother, who happened to come across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call for rape.
A study by Digital Security UK and Healthmasters' and Headmisses'Conference (HMC) organizations in private schools found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles in social networks, half of which admitted that an additional account was secret.
The head of the HMC Mike Buchanan Association said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online environment where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elyd Doyle will be the "representative of athletes' interests" at the Scott Atlantic Council
Elyd Doyle is elected to the Scotts Atlantic Council as an independent director during the annual general board of government members.
Doyle is Scotland's best-founded and easy-to-flyer, and the head of Council Jan Beatty called this step a great opportunity for those who lead a sport movement to take advantage of its wide experience at the international level during the last decade.
"Elyd has a huge respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain, and the world, and we are convinced that the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to act as an athlete, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - year - old Olympic champion who won a race of 200 and 400 meters in 1996 in Atlanta, and now a sports watchman for BBC, lost the opportunity to go through a transit cherma attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors claimed that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thanks for the words of support!"
In an ad, women's milkball was compared to cows, and the thinking of Internet users was divided
A mammoster manufacturer encountered a controversial Internet user response to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to existing cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent multi-milk milkballer," an electronic consumer consumer manufacturing company, Elvie, issued an ad in the form of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker offers to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cowess under a song that contains these words, "Yes, I'm feeding myself, but I don't have a tail" and "As you see yourself, it's not my hand, it's not my breast."
He goes on to say, "Smooth, suck, suck, feed, suck, suck, don't waste milk."
However, the ads, published on Facebook’s page, caused a heated discussion online.
The video has got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet users' reactions have proved to be mixed, and many people have noted that advertising doesn't appreciate milk production in industry.
"It is not a very clever decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are chosen to be taken away from them a few days after they were born,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie’s milk detector can easily be hidden in the feeding gastro (Elvie/Moteer)
So here's another comment, "It's clear that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not involve them in the promotion of a milkbag for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is far from reality."
Some of the women's videos appeared to be "very funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have acquired such a thing if I was still breast - fed.
As I sucked my milk, I felt really like a cow.
The ads are a little crazy, but I didn't find any secret meaning in it.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad directed to moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the breast industry."
At the end of the video, women are showing milkballs hidden in their bras.
The concept of a publicity campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
But Elvie's sucker works perfectly quietly, doesn't have wires or tubes, and it's easy to hide in a feeding bra, which allows women to move freely, keep children, and even go outside.
Ana Balareen, a partner and executive creative director of the Mater advertising agency, commented on the situation: "The Elvie Monitor is so revolutionary that it requires a vivid and provocative presentation.
Having a parallel between women who are curing milk and true cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way showing an incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker will bring.
Elvie monitor is not the first time in news headlines.
Within the framework of the week fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on a podium with this product while showing clothes from the fashion designer Martha Jacobowska.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although monthly cross-borders have remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics on the part of the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers themselves acted without documents, and now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to hand fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week Matthew Albens, the head of the Immigration and Instant Control Bureau, testified to Congress that dozens of people had been arrested by officers of the Bureau who had applied for care of minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal, and many of them are foreigners who have committed wrongdoing.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to asylum workers, in order to deal with children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days later.
Many of them will be able to use a video conference connection rather than come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, by court decision, are not entitled to asylum will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawmakers claim that these problems are increasing in larger facilities, such as Thornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or say good - bye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S. occupying forces, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In addition, before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Secretary, Valid Al-Mual, urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though war had been taking place in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as a deputy minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian land in the fight against terrorism, so "to deal with them would be appropriate."
"They must leave immediately without imposing conditions," he claimed at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
There were about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured them that the conditions for their return were right, and he accused them of some Western countries of spreading untrue fears that refugees did not dare to return.
"We have called on international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We are observing efforts to fly a strictly humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria to restore countries until the political agreement between Asad and the opposition to end the war has been concluded.
United Nations diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great arena of rebels, has created the possibility of continuing political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish treaty, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by the Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province of three million people.
Mualel, however, stressed that the treaty had “the clear terms” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the fighters associated with Al-Qaeda Front Al-Nusr, who would “be destroyed”.
UN emissary Staffan de Missouri hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will be composed of representatives of the government and opposition, in order to develop the postwar constitution for Syria and to create conditions for holding elections.
Mualem laid the groundwork for the Syrian government to participate on the committee, stating that his work should be limited to “reviewing articles of a valid constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Changed
According to this logic, Trump may be re-elected in 2020, if many liberal viewers are likely to expect it not to be fully authorized after a scandal and imprecise.
No doubt it would be "the most far-reaching end of the presidency all the time."
At present, spectators do not give signs of weariness.
Since 2014, the number of viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
And according to Nielsen, at Fox News, on average, 2.4 million viewers in the business line, relative to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Madow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel was at a peak of 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when the main news was under discussion.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Bere, executive producer of the "The Last candidate" drama on the ABC channel about the Secretary of State who becomes president after a destructive attack on Capitolia.
Nell Skwell, an experienced humanitarian writer and author of the book "Lisdomy Things: As well as a few severe truths about entering Hollywood Men's Club" offer a different theory.
She remembered her trip to Boston before her election in 2016.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said.
Chaos's having fun.
Of course, unlike any other contents on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Roy's case against Wade, the possibility of combining immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Departure is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you've been watching a group of experts discuss the use by Bob Woodworth of "good known" sources for their book "Storch," Paul Manafort's jacket of the ostrich skin for 15,000" -- and that's how it was written in The Washington Post -- and the result of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy, published by Stormie Denis.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of reality is partly related to what you get every night being fed by something new," observed Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wehelhouse Entertainment, and author of TV programs called Raebardu, on the rotation of the actress, and on the daily stage turnouts on the "Tramp" show, the support of Kim Chen Ina.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can be hopelessly distant.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleis in his house on the northern coast of Kauai this week, there was a warm sun weather (27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C]), but he sat at home watching MSNBC and writing CNN.
He was not able to break free from the TV — not when Britta Kawano was brought before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in his hair.
"I remember we were creating all those crazy shows of our time, and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flese said to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External cost-sharing in the most extreme mid-term elections in Congress
It is no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are additional monetary influences, since two valid conventioners are looking for one chair because of a review of the boundaries of the election districts.
In the struggle for this suburban region of Pittsburgh, the borders of which were recently changed, a democracy enters, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won the other district at an additional election last spring.
Lembre opposes another legal congressman, Republican Kit Rotfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders correspond to the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the circuits were in favor of Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Pre-election contests in the new 17th district led to strong opposition between the financial units of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic Party (NRC).
The name of Lemba became very well known in Pennsylvania after winning the minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections of Congress in March, which were widely respected by the public.
President Donald Trump won this district with 20 points.
Political experts gave little advantage to democracies.
U.S. has considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support but has changed its mind.
Diplomats were reminded of the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously upheld Pekin’s position.
In June 2017, Trump met warmly with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, who had a hotel in Panama before his partners removed the personnel hired by the Tremp Organization.
Officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through “the recent decisions on Taiwan's ignorance”, reported the Secretary-General to the Department of Gezer Neyerte early this month.
But the situation was only against El Salvador, which received about US$ 140 million in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce financial aid and target visas would be painful for Central America, with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to internal councillors from North and Central America, conferences were held at high levels on security and economic prosperity last year, and were considered a step forward in efforts to keep migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level officials of the administration had given an idea of what they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the question of the sanctions against El Salvador had stopped at this point.
According to diplomats, vice president Mike Pens is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October on what the Administration considers this event to be very important.
At the same time, three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new hard reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on details of the internal discussions that three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, were in an anonymous condition.
The information they gave confirmed a non - analyst who was close to the administration, who also spoke on an anonymous basis.
Learn History
The next problem may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller about possible interference with justice from the Trump, a strong indication of why public information is now available.
As part of his investigation, Müller is said to check out the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the influence of Congress comes into the hands of others, the Trump will have to report to the conventioners, as well as to the voters and, ultimately, to the other parties.
There's a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that Tramp's fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make choices that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to set up a coup d’état against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The move of history is determined by these turning points, and the relentless movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now in contact with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Trump releases the deputy attorney general of Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper reported that last year he was offering a secret recording of discussions with the President and was sharing his thoughts on the topic of subordination of the post.
She called the information in The Times a bit inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation against Britta Kawano, which recently opened the FBI, does not prove to be thorough or honest, or if Kavano's candidate for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold the Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't believe we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Ambassador’s house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.

Graham Dorance with Rangers optimistically awaits a meeting with the Vienna Radio.
The Ringers FK accepts the Radio on Thursday, after an amazing night in Spain in a game with Villarreal early this month, victory over the Austrians will provide a Scottish club with good chances of leaving the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, Graham Dorrances was able to play for the first time in the season for his team only in the game with Villarreal, which ended with account 2:2, but he thinks that the Rangers FK can use this as a tramplin to achieve more.
"This has been a good result for us, because Villerreal is a powerful team," observed a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, we can probably think of a fair result as a night.
In the first time, the enemy was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
Thursday will have another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, and our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the painkillers, and I'm sure we can get a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, was a difficult one, starting from my injuries and ending with the changes at the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can go further, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of retirement insurance
Even though the surveyers had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize self-care, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study of the Nationalwood company said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of those surveyed spoke about it with the children.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwood, in the area of life insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not inform your parents in advance.
Consult your consultant and family to determine where and how to get care, because that choice can become an important factor when determining cost.
Take advantage of a financial consultant, and he can recommend how to cover the cost.
The sources of funding for long-term care include traditional insurance policy, hybrid policy of accumulation of life insurance, or self-reliance at the expense of your own money.
If you have a legal record carefully, this will enable you to avoid legal action ahead of time.
Prepare trust for your authority to monitor your health care and to ensure that your professional wishes are met if you are unable to do so personally.
We may also recommend that we make money - sponsored arrangements.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will pay his bills in case of disability.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palm on Friday, and they report to the government authorities, but the number of casualties could increase.
By leaving the communications system, the humanitarian aid officials can't get any information from Dongual, a district north of Palm, which's closer to the 7th ball earthquake epicenter.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palm.
Consider some of the basic facts about the town of Pálo and Dongala on Sulavez Island.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawes, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulaves, with a population of 379,800, according to the figure of 2017.
When there was an earthquake that caused a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donguala is a more than 300 - mile [180 - km] reagent along the coast line in the northwest island of Sulavez.
According to the 2017 census, the administrative region in the lower part of the province has some 299,200 inhabitants.
Fishing and agriculture are the main areas of the economy of Central Sulawes, especially the Dongala coastal region.
The mining of a tonic is also important in the province, but mainly focused in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulavez.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, over the past 100 years, Palau and Dongual have been hit by tsunamis several times.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed as a result of the Dongle tsunami.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongle, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a safe, active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of Aceg, in northern Sumatra, struck a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people — more than half of them — along the coast of the Indian Ocean.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the southern side of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, caused a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points was recorded.
More than 1,100 people were killed.

Hundreds gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Saiful Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in eight deaths — a rare penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953 for federal crime.
It is said that in October 30-year-old Saips driving a house-to-Doot papa drove up a cycle track along the highway in West Sayid, Lower Manhattan, and started beating up the bikers and pedestrians that happened to him on his way.
According to the report of the intention to be able to kill in New York State’s southern district to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipi “surrenderly” killed eight people and “surpassedly” committed serious bodily harm.
According to the court records, each of these charges involves the possibility of death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of the jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal accusers usually make in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The accusers, who described Saipov’s crime as “suffering, cruel and malicious”, said that this attack was the result of“really planned and thought out of purpose”.
The victims of Saiful Habbulalevid Saipov's trauma, injury or killing, were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevez, Anne-Lor Descadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruy, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alegand Damihan Paklukco, as described in the mission report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case in the South district of New York, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the federal death penalty was imposed in New York City in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saip’s court records, Uzbekistan’s native did not demonstrate his conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saip’s indictment, he was told by the authorities that he had been inspired by the video IDIL that he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked for an IDILE flag in his hospital ward.
He did not accuse himself of being charged with 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipus, said that they were "very disappointed" by this decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than admit guilt and sentence life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only increase the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims," said Patton.
Saipia’s defense party had also earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative Party’s Deputate believes that NAJAL FARRAJA is responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Faraj promised to “mobilize the People's Army”.
The former leader of the Union of Independence of the United Kingdom stated that politicians should “result under pressure” from the Euroskeptics because a member of Parliament, Terez Mei, offered to stand for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bowe's Conservative Party deputate on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would come out if Mr. Faraj had been Secretary of Brexit.
The attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile its deep-rooted ranks was further attracted by the fact that the deputies from the Conservative Party who opposed the exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite the brexit supporters, those who are fighting against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not give up trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative response, and will force the Eurosketists and the labourists to choose between what she offers, and the chaos.
Mr. Bown said he wanted to "absolve from Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraju to leave the shadows and take over the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge of it, we would have gone out," he said.
Wellingborough's delegation added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, said, "We fought in world wars, not to subjugate.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowon rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed, saying, "The idea that the British changed their minds and didn't want to go out is completely wrong."
The Conservative Party member and the Brexit Manager, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prem Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not backed up by our party and our activists who are actually walking through the streets and fighting for voters' votes.
Please put away Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "Premier ministers keep their position when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should “feel under pressure” if they were to give up the decision of the referendum of 2016.
"Now is a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he claimed.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which is going to betray Brexit, to experience pressure.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never come to rest until we become independent, self-governmentd, proud of the United Kingdom."
In the meantime, opponents passed Birmingham and then held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists waved the Conservatives v. Brexit when they started this group.
The Lesborist Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservators because security problems arose after the conference opened up through their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
'It's the whole farce.'
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to think seriously about being a president.
U.S. Senator Elisabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would "seriously think about being a president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday at the West Massachusetts general meeting, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is fighting in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Della, who was co-headed by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered to be the main candidate to fight Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon her 36th meeting with the voters in general meeting format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the election as president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that, there's got to be a woman on his head."
They arrested a suspect of killing out of a weapon of basketball, LUS Tigers, Sims.
But at Baton Rog, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that on Friday, a suspect was arrested in the murder of a basketball fighter, "LUS Tigers" by Wade Sims.
The Baton Roz police office announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of a shooting asking to help identify a person on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot at a company at the University of Suthern on Friday morning.
"Wed Sims was shot in the head and killed," stated 247 reporters to police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade took a stand for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was at the scene of crime, was carrying arms, and was shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody at the police department of East Baton District.
Sims, who was about six feet tall and six inches tall and was standing in a juvenile league, grew up in Baton Roz, he played 32 games with 10 stars last season, and spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the playing field, at 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Grace Hemilton reduced the backlog in the fight for world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fetel
From the moment that Walter Bottas left Lewis Himmelton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had been a good start from the field position, and he was almost past Himmilton, trying to keep his position on the first two turns and giving the Fate an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fetel went to the pit-stop first and left Hemelton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to decide.
Mercedes's pilot passed one more circle and came out behind Fetel, but Himmilton bursted into the lead after a certain wheel maneuver, leaving Ferraris' driver reluctantly left the inner space because of the risk of being pressed after double maneuvering he managed to escape on a third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferrappin started off from the back row of the net and stayed in the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He then held the bulk of the race, since he did not change the tires so that he could quickly come to finish up and move Kimie Raikkonen from his fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at a pit stop on the 44th track, but he couldn't increase his pace by the last eight, so he would sit down at the fourth place.
"This is a hard day, because Knave was laid out on full weekends and showed grace when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team did a very special job to sit first and second, ” said Gimilton.
Body Language Not Impressed
At the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dayan Feinstein for her firm stand that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blezi Ford accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Britta Kawano of sexual abuse.
During the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about the events in the Senate that he said demonstrated human "property, ignominy and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who are showing the meanness, the disgustingness and the lyingness," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information that's being released, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It is not me."
Remember?
Diane Fanstain, did you publish the information?
Remember her answer... Did you communicate the contents of the documents? - "What?
Oh, no.
I have not declared.”
Wait a minute.
We've announced? No, we haven't announced," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Fainstein received a letter containing a detailed statement of charges raised by Ford v. Cavano, and at the beginning of September, his contents were released, but Fainstein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information he had received from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have failed to please the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone get worse."
By continuing to defend the candidate before the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence, the President assumed that the democracies were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to return power by any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the disgustingness, they're still the one who's offended, the one that needs to be crossed to get power and control." — Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Balphast Jainants" 5:3
James player Patrick Duyer dropped two jacks in his match against "Dandy"
"Dande Stars" was rehabilitated for a Friday defeat in the elite league from "Belfast Jainances" by winning a five-thirds match on Saturday.
James's got an early advantage in two sixs because of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowler's clads.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the account at the home match and then Dwyer took James back in the front.
The Dande player, François Bushar, compared the bill, and the two naked Lucas Lundwald Nielsen, ensured their victory.
This is the third time in the elite league season of Adam Kif's team, who won the war on Dundee with 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, and the three previous match wins the James team.
The first Shaibu Duyer dropped in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendalla McFal, and after four minutes, Boville, who had received the shalab from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After an intense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Sullivan returned the householders to the game, and on his sixteenth minute.
Dwyer preferred James before the first break, throwing his second chess at the end of the first period.
The heads of the fields were regrouped, and Bush on the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again compared the bill by throwing down the Sabbath when its team was nearly superior.
Because of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen's efforts, at the end of the second period, he first brought "Dandy" forward and won his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jamess team, which has already lost four of the last five games, plays a travel match against Milton Kins.
Air traffic crasher died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
After he spent his life flying a plane with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after the tsunami earthquake hit Friday in Sulawes.
Strong underground shocks continue to shake the area, and many people found themselves trapped in the city of Palm.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Guanavan Agung refused to leave his post in the airstrip, which was being torn apart, at Mutiar SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in Palm.
He stayed in place to make sure that the Buik Air flight of 6,321 airlines, which was then on airstrip, was safely up the air.
Then he jumped out of the air tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
In time, he died in a hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Service Provider, Johanes Sirayt, claimed that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipapana to Kalimantan to be taken to a larger hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palma.
"We are very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the disaster relief agency in the country claims that access to the cities of Dongual, Sigi and Botong is limited.
"The number of victims can grow because many bodies are still in the debris, and many of them cannot be reached," stated a representative of the Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo Agency.
The waves, which reached six feet [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials would be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Reese Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom, said Sky News, "Every minute quick help brings the bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-marques are burgled everywhere."
Jan Hefnd, head of the International Red Cross Committee in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but everything can get a lot worse."
President Joko Ododo came to Palm on Sunday and said to the country's military, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing over 550 people.
Air Niugini, as reported in Micronesia, was the accident of one man who disappeared after the plane fell into the area.
A report that carried out a flight disaster in the Pacific Lagos disaster in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared, although all 47 passengers and crews were reported to have been evacuated safely from an airplane that was sinking.
At Air Niugini, it was said that one passenger could not be found on Saturday.
A report reports that its representatives seek to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about a passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and the team after the plane fell into the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
At the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the south of the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low over the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others had managed to get into crash exits on a thin plane by the belt in the water.
He told me that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he had suffered a slight trauma to his head.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked near the dock’s modernization were also helped by rescue operations, delivering people to shore with an inflated boat before the plane sank to the depths of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades 111 people have died in air crashs related to PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rolett witnessed as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used his mobile phone records to replicate the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim's night of murder.
Rolett, according to The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received data on the location of several mobile phones, which showed that Telis was with Chambers that night when she died, which was contrary to his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sandford witnessed and claimed that he was out of town on that day.
When the accusers were asked if Telis was telling the truth, when he said that he was in the pinnacle of Sandford that night, Sandford said that he was "better because my picnic was in Nesville."
Another contradiction was that Teliss claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rolett explained that some time after Chambers Telis’s death, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"He's wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense has to make its concluding arguments on Sundays.
The judge expects the trial to be passed on to the jury later that day.
The Big Bridd: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop-conspirators want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The Higg Breed of Bristle says that hip hop-hop changes its nature – has retreated away from political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed the revival of this trend in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
In New York City, the nanny sued for a release couple, getting a "racist" message
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for a discretionary release after she received a wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "just another black girl."
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the lawsuits with "absurrections."
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that a new nanny, Giselle Morris, who had come to her first day in 2016, a black woman.
Mrs. Placco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a report.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she twice sent him to Miss Morris.
As Ms. Placson-Flaxman said after realizing her mistake, she released Ms. Morris, saying that their previous nanny, who was an African American, did not do her job well and that instead she was waiting for the Philippines nurse.
Mrs. Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris's getting a couple to court, hoping to get a release payment, which she'd get in six months of working with a couple she was hired at first, even though she had no contract, and she had to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Maurice was a wise decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco, her husband.
'But would you leave your children with a man who was being rude, even if it wasn't deliberate?'
Your baby?
NAVAD."
Compared the susceptive lawsuits, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and that she had not given up.
"Would you take revenge after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, critical of their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking.
Bond Karen Young's daughter, born almost immediately after the book agreed to print, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before they published it.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success of the Padington story."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, optimistically thought that his work had been rejected, she shared it on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time felt like joy and sadness, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding the Padington, which she describes as a "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the book being so popular.
"He was a pretty modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child!
I think he's looking at Padington's success exactly like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good - bye
After landing, her daughter was taken to two hospitals named Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Ned regularly phoned, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
'And then over called me and said she would die for the next two minutes and I'd say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that doctors gave her to continue fighting, gradually shut down, and left her body.
She died some time before she turned it off.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't push, cry, or cry because my family and people surrounded me.
I should've really kept it in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was grieved over the loss of her daughter, took a plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had experienced.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had put my head down and could not hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during my flight that I began to feel deeply for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grief - stricken women leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries leave telephone cards on the Wally Bridge that people can turn to for support as well as messages that can inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at age 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I am every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydia, told me that her son was a promising cook with a pretty smile.
"All knew him for a smile.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was like, "Both in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that's going to have consequences."
Miss Davis made some cards so people knew there were those who they could turn to and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Miss Humphries, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt depressed, that he was depressed or that way," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely despondent, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or something."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to survive this, "It's been devastating.
Oh, yeah, well, we're gonna have a family.
But we must keep on living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging in his hair: the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we wanted -- limited time and character of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would be falling apart in the face of an unprecedented loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
Inter-elections will go in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to try to run their own person into the Supreme Court of the country through the election.
George W. Bush phoned senators to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 democracies, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kawano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and endorse his candidate as a Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Koreans "swifted."
After Kim Jong In came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea was reduced by a South Korean lawgiver.
Pack Pyon Séug, referring to data from the Ministry of Union of the Republic of South Korea, stated that the number of outflows last year was 1,127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the main factors were the increase in border control between North Korea and China, and the fact that smugglers who carry non-Leaers now demand more money for it.
In Pyongyang, he refrained from making public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually offer citizenship to South Korea.
In Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces repatriation.
The relationship between North and South Korea, still in a formal state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, leaders from two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issues of denuclearization that had been discussed in the impasse.
This happened after a June historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Inn of Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ryong-Ho, against the background of the sanctions, accused the United States of no progress since then.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our country's security, so there can be no language of unilateral disarmament," said Ri Yon-Ho in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Bretta Cavanaugh "isterious" and says he's not fit to work with the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pélosi, named the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court of Britta Cavano “isterious” and claimed that he was not available to the Supreme Court by the heat.
Plossi expressed his opinion in the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking that if a woman ever did this, she would be called "sterious," Pelosy commented on her reaction to Kavano's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally denied the charges of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both of them were teenagers.
In her opening remarks, Cavano acted emotionally, sometimes screaming and throwing himself away, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democracies of the committee, calling the charges against him “an absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation,” organized liberals, who were angry at the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pélosi, his testimony proved that he could not work before the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice against the democracies.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the democracies, he will take his own stand," she said.
Pelosi was offended when asked if she would try to announce Kavano immigration if his guilt was confirmed and if the majority of the people in the House of Representatives would get the democracy.
"I'll say, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just right to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's working now," said Pelos.
Kawano is now a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Plossi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Kawano's possible decisions against the law on accessible health care or the Rou v. Wade case because he was considered conservative.
At his hearings on the issue of confirmation in the position of Kawano, the party questioned whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now the wrong time is when the judge becomes an intrusive, prejudiced person, and we will say how wonderful that is," said Pelosey.
Women must use this weapon.
These were just words that contained a period of months and years of rage, and she could not express them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Stoym, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, but you?"
She continued: “A woman who has worked somewhere as executive director and has been very helpful to me said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the householder, ‘ You can think I’m sad and I’m crying.
I am evil."
And after that, she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are considered to be an acceptable out of anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most intimate memories of my first job in the office where men worked was the situation when I cried on one occasion from indescribable anger, and the older woman was the unwelcome manager, whom I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me into the east cage.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they're getting to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratist from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garta was caught on board a boat called the Monkey Business, after which he left the race, Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not compete for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she told me with laughter in 30 years.
"The race already involved seven other candidates, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called the situation "Bylonsk and Seven Herms."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she had to put aside funds in the congregation, so she made a promise that she would not be able to participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret their men’s support, had given her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she exclaimed.
When she delivered the talk and announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was surrounded by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it very difficult to collect money and made it more difficult for the voters not to go as far as the members of the Chamber of Deputies, and the anger of sexism, and she was willing to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Ms. Schroeder's press reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
And then I was thinking about what they're going to write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. - China trade war can bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S. - China trade war were desperate, and although far from it, the long - term differences between countries can be of benefit to Beijing.
The U.S. president Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year, taxing basic Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
This week’s biggest situation was due to the new 200 billion dollars (U.S.) market tariffs, which virtually cover half of all the goods that come from China in the United States.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently putting a bowl ranging from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to applying similar US measures, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to miss this promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means accepting the requirements, but for Chinese President Cy Zingpin, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
But experts believe that if Beijing uses the situation correctly, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can give China the advantage in the long run by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A fast political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic collapse in any country, and this is actually a greater threat than the observers had admitted before," said analyst Egil Grace, who deals with issues related to Asia at the Analian Center for New America Security.
Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was prepared to return refugees
Syria claims to be ready for voluntary return of refugees and to seek help in rebuilding countries devastated by war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Secretary, Valid Al-Mual, stated that the country's conditions were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal lives.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to help restore a war-torn country.
But he pointed out that they would not accept conditional help or help from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe forces the victory of the Rider Cubku in Paris
The European team won the Rider Club in 2018 when the U.S. team won a total of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has already defeated Europe for six times and hasn't won the Coke Rider since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team gained 14.5 points they needed to win the victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who did his best to try most of the tournament, struck his first long shot at the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and gave it to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever been with a 5-0-0 account since the start of the tour in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit defeated account 5:4 at the lowest rating on the European team of Turbian Olesen from Denmark.
Danstein Johnson, who takes the first stage in the world's rating, gave him an account of 2:1 Jan Poulter, from England, who may have participated in the "Cubby Ryder" tournament for the last time.
The Spanishman, Serhio Garcia, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the whole time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't do anything.
It was a hard year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so glad, so glad to get the cube back.
It's the team's honor, and I'm happy to be able to help," he said, without holding back my emotions, Garcia after winning Europe.
He's sending the Estafé to his fellow countryman, John Remu, who defeated American legends of Golf Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a 2-1 account.
"I feel an incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Well, Woods in France has lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Ruder Club 13-21-3.
Amazing statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Moigeor tournaments, giving up just Jack Niclaus.
Throughout the weekend, the United States was trying to reach the fewe area, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, which showed high-class golf throughout the tour.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a sad speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we did little to dominate Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Association of Professional Workers in golf and the Kubok Rider Round Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
Not to be commended.
We've lost."
