Life is sometimes so unfair.
I'm not planning on doing that anymore.
Tom has a full suitcase.
You idiot!

He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Tell the smart man a mistake and he'll thank you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything there.
Make clear your point.
They don't know us.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
You really think I'd do it?
It's a lie.
The war took away their happiness.

She always has time after lunch.
A herbal takes up a smaller part of the earth’s surface.

This story has comforted me.
Watch out!
I'll miss you.
Take this.

Tom likes everyone.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.

Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take away the dirty thing.

He passed the exam.
You're whose friend?
Tom's too tired to do.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty convincing, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.

They are compassionate.
Why didn't you tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm asleep.
Aren't you ready for a bigger one?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for a job.
Father will return in a few days.
Is it true that Midori plays a very good violin?
Well, that explains it.

Tom's angry with you, right?
I'd like to be a famous football player.
Did I hurry?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn’t get the answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do this.
I borrowed Tom's car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
There's almost no furniture.
I'm ready to go, and Tom's not.
I feel different.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.

When was the last time you bought shoes?

You have to tell the truth.
You may be right.
This one looks better.

Is that annoying to you?
What's in the box?
She's still hot.

What was inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you like about summer or winter?
Aren't you planning on doing this?

It's not as hard as you think it is.
Why are you angry with me?
Let's get drunk.
You need to wait.

You have to stop doing this right now.
My grandfather is talking very slowly.
Did you win?
It can speak English quite well.
I have to go.
Tom didn't seem too anxious.
Tom says he's planning to do it.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me one minute?
Is there anything cold about drinking?

What does your father do?
I'm a loser.
Do you know my wife?
Tom started studying French.

You think Tom's part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom's waiting for me at the station.
I'm putting cream in my coffee.
I can't carry this noise anymore.
Please don't go yet.

I read the letters you sent me.
Have you ever seen an accident?
I know you were joking.
You want to learn how to play the guitar?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait, I'll pay for it.

We all slept.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
What is it?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have money.
I thought Tom got it.

I'm a taxer.
In his right hand, Tom holds his pen.
There are lots of different kinds of coffee.
I'm glad you're okay.

I suspect Tom isn't involved.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll handle Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He was very busy all day.
Tom's coming back, I'm sure he'll come back.
He managed to escape.

Who else was meeting?
He's talking too fast.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
Tom's gonna help you?

I hope you'll come back.
Is there something you'd like to buy?
You told me to do it.
Tom and Mary are rivals.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try not to cry.
You have a very sharp hearing.
Can I do this again?
Are your kids still asleep?

Or Tom Christian?
I want to see what happens.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you do.

He's a office worker.
You think Tom's gonna win, right?
Can't you stop, please?
They followed you.
I'm waiting for your answer.

Open up your kids.
We drank a lot.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom's gonna dance.
Give me your wallet.
You don't have anything.

Why am I so tired?
Wait till the end of my exams.

Makross for judit is writing to BeanShell.
You want to go to the concert with us?
Is that a fire car?
All food and drink are delicious and beneficial, but you need to know time, place, and measure.
I think it's a good app.
I wonder if she will recognize me after so many years.
Sometimes I'm very careless.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him for about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the report in time.
It's unlikely that I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She's traveling around the world.
The guys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary what she should do.

It's a very good movie.
Why isn't nobody answering?
Tom told me he thought he had a flu.
My blood's gone.
You gave me good advice.
It's not that bicycle.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
Tom wasn't called.
No one knows what happens.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you for your attention.
I didn't apologize.
Many young people ate in Hawaii this summer.
Tom is my twin brother.
At this point, there are no comments.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Don't resist.
You'll pay for it!
Do you understand me?
Tom's cut.
Tom thinks Mary can do that?
Is that your hat?

He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why do you need so many shoes?
You're very brave.
I'm totally naked.
No one has heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said, where did he do that?
We study Chinese.
How can I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
There's nothing.
Let me see.
Tom started to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He's running to the station every morning.
They're running out of supply.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So it's somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the plates?
Were you in Washington, D.C., U.S. capital?
Mary kept her balance.
I'm just lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a picture.
I wonder if Tom is angry or not.
I have to prepare for the test.
The plane flew east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
In Soviet Russia, TV is watching spectators!

Are you a vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to me. What am I supposed to say?
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't crash.
I have a question.
What was missing!
Tom said that Mary must still be doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The chief allowed me to leave earlier today.
At what hour is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not asking Tom for help.
How much you paid to do it.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do that.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
It's time for me to go.
I was broken.
Tom got me.
How many people died?
Did these guys do something to you?

Are these rumors true?
That's what we really want, isn't it?
Finally, he made up his mind to make her offer.
Tom was not surprised that Mary was speaking French so well.
I know you're here.
It's half past three.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
That's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost there.
So you have to be at home at 2:30 p.m.
Do you go to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girlfriend?
Tom's just wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We realize that.
It's not a good time right now.
You'll have time for lunch with me?
I'm sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
Careful with Bob, you know, he just went through a difficult period.
Tom married a neighbor.
I'm sick of my head.
Say it again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I study English.
Good weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate that!
You're a little young to me.
Tom's too old for you.
Tom said he expected Mary to do it.
Tom didn't look around.
My parents just arrived at the station.
I waved with my hand.
This year did you buy a Christmas present for Tom?
He's somehow involved in this robbery.
My cat looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat the vegetables that they themselves grow.

Where's Dad?
Who helped you?
I'd love to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog's trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea that Mary fell on him.
Tom's disgusting.
The pharmacist is on Fresno Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear bad news?
I talked to them.
Did Lucy call?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash myself.
Look at me!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one's listening anymore.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put it down.
Tom's the last one.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You're really gonna find them, right?
I can't stand the humidity.
Are you sure Tom's coming?
Where did you get this key?
Can I help you, lady?
I don't think I'm gonna be scared.
Tom's gonna go instead of you.
Do you think fish can hear?
Tom got fired yesterday.
The woman reads.

No one would help me.
You're an Italian.
What is she like?
A pocket thief took a passport from Mark.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including shipping.
I'll miss you.
I went to the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees this.
I went to the wrong bus.
I turned down that offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
You reserved the table?
Where's the money going?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like it.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's about going to a picnic.
We could not buy tickets for a concert until we received money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe another time.
Tom refused to let Mary enter the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
That's why you need it.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a place cannot get the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has good eyes.
She gave me a Christmas book.
I want cheeseburger, col and potatoes of fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do this.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers red with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's down.
He was great.
Tom knows she didn't.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how this is done.
Drink?
Tom's gonna do this with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting started at five o'clock.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary was not busy.
I was only once in Tokyo.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do this.
The attendance of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A little cup of coffee is worth two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this?
We're happy with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He stood in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always say that to me.
Is this Mary's husband?
She'll find out.
The Witness who saw things with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard all.
Guess who I am.
Tom came back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's done.
When I went into the room, she played the piano.
You're very cute.
Where are your manners?
They didn't give up hope.
Tom threw himself into Mary's egg.
When do you expect to come?
Tom tried his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know how she likes colors?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's spring soon.
It is spoken in two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase.
I left the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant hole.
Wear salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane's gone exactly at nine.
Tom speaks French very freely.
John caught the tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out.
Tom's had a cold towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The following month Tom left Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year millions die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address in the letter.
This is the last train.
Who's gonna fight?
I found the meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
Everyone's in chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I have to be more careful.
I've seen them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do this?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I've just been shaking up.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
We're on our own.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis guy.
That's how Tom came to be famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did everything irreprehensibly.
I love writing.
Kyoto is a uniquely beautiful city.
The next month, I'm about sixteen.
You think there's a probability of this happening?
I want you to accept your dreams.
At what time will your final lesson end?
I'm here to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to get in touch with her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was the book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary do it.
We have to help Tom.
It was raining all day.
I'm upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock leaves for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I got her up.
You were right earlier.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with the boss.
It's a banana.
Tom's probably gonna be punished for what he's done.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London was filled with fog.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to conduct it.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil’s capital — Brasília
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay my phone bill.
Tom knows how to cook.
But the music makes him nervous.
What languages do we speak in America?
You deserve some rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's got huge eyes.
There's seven colors in a rainbow.
I think that's why we shouldn't do this.
He's dark today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on duty to-night?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
You or Jane have to go there.
I'd ignore that if I were you.
Tom's gonna be here right now.
It's the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?

I'm real.
Happiness is not the possession of many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed up on the side of the mountain.

I heard him come down the stairs.
That's mine.
How strange!
Can you read the brick?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an idiot.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I could never do that without your help.
I always have coffee and money for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't dream.
I'm the best.
How'd your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Has this just happened?
Mary didn't take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
I told you the truth, I told you the lie.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did that.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a song?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I'm too ashamed.
I'm getting into the details.
Tom said he didn't want to.
Let's go to the ocean.
Do you know what causes the problem?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
Today I have a good appetite.
We're comfortable in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity, I can't be sure about the first one.
She said, "I'm very happy."
Tom's curious to talk to.

What are you staring at?
Can't we go faster?
We're not just football players.

I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
The password is "Mauriel."
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take the garbage out.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can I borrow your knives?
Thank her for your help.

I wonder if Tom told Mary what she should do.
All the dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all the animals are dogs.
Those who may think only one way to write a word are evidently lacking imagination.
I'm sure of his success.
That's not what Tom did.
Where's the next subway station?

I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Answer me right now.
I had a suspicion Tom was homesick.

No one saw Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would have done.

The hotel may accommodate 300 people.
That's why I did the pie.
He may ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What does Tom do in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I have a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a team member.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy preparing dinner.
The horses are useful animals.
Come back quickly.
It's incompetent.
Thomas was trained.
He's inexorable.
He's sure he's gonna run the exam.
Tom voted for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do that?
Let's go!
Attention!
I'm exhausted.
The outlook isn't too bright.
I don't believe anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the devil's literary song.
The trouble is, she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Did Tom say he'd spent the last weekend with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
A child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to control yourself.
We're okay.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We'll lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Say it.
The surface of the balloon, which is an invertebrate space, does not comply with euclidic geometry.
The negotiations were successful.
I'm sorry for that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and upright.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice as old as I am.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I lost the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The language of programming is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watchs do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So you don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom's very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
Do you want to know?
Tom needs to wear clothes.
I need this money.
My tie is orange.
Tom's still crying?
So it'd be better to be taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes went off.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a yellow dress.
It's a bitter taste to love.
The meeting's over.
You should have done this last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I'm eating every year.
I felt helpless.
I like my teacher.
We're on an elevator.
Tom's a professional hockeyist.

I'm not determined enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.

I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The mirrors were scattered over the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She went to school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I have to do that.
State debt goes up.
Why am I not you?
Tom may never do that.
That's a doll.
Get saved!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bicycle?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaca in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're beautiful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's get to know him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest that.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
Computer can count very quickly.
You don't need it.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What weather is there?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Do you want more tea?
This is a Japanese doll.
What did you eat tonight?
You can't even change the papers.
People still using web cameras?
I wonder if Tom had ever asked Mary why she had left school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
The brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.

He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a cheese fish salad?

We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John's older than me for two years.
For better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He could easily answer my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to concentrate.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still here with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw the stones.
She has a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often see him?
Tom would love you.
Are you hungry yet?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in a year two.
Tom's probably gonna do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a brief peace, war again broke out.
It's better not to trust him.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
Where's my laptop?
I don't think there's any problem.
Tom's broken?
You need to jump up.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'm right the shirt.
When is his return expected?
I had a good rest.
He's no less kind than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It'd be good if there were 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He'd like it to not happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have money.
I don't teach anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Go on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn how to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's a man-worker, so to speak.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any tension.
It's a fake.
That wasn't Tom asking Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom's often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, it was broadcast by Grant.
Tom's proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised by Tom’s desire to do so.
English isn't my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we should not do this again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom was staring at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children while she's gone.
I'm going to fuck you.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why would Tom do that?
I know the father of this girl.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I got thirty points.
If I don't, Tom's gonna get mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
A big tree fell on the road, and when I was driving, it blocked my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have much friends.
Do you believe in a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind from birth.
Didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start homesicking?
How do you like men?
Why are people still smoking?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, he's not.
I tried to do just that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sledge.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday must be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I disagree with him.
Maybe you should help them paint the fence.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
You're wise.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should consult a doctor.
I've got the papers on my visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The rope broke out as we walked up the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate fewer hamburgers, you would probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go on my own.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is it?
Where's daddy?
Shut the door.
I'm not talking to Tom in French.
Apples do not fall far from the apple tree.
Be realistic.
Who did you talk to?
The uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Don't you mind?
I haven't seen you for all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
You want to do this, huh?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me look at Tom's book.
Japan’s main islands are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsa, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money at the bank.
I think we should leave now.
We didn't.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
You're gonna break up.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We equipped our office with computers.
We have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom's gonna do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
It's going to be brilliant.
I'm scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do this?
Tom witnessed Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Will you not vote?
You should quit.
I think Tom's a traitor.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play violin?
Can you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom's good to speak French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's miserable.
Both students and teachers were popular.
You can't help the mountain with tears.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
Another coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks to an esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
It sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' dealer.
I'll handle it.
Have you found any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a wizard?
I'm good?
Even a teacher may make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom play with you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom stretched Mary beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He's back at the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The speakers instinctively follow the rules of their own language without even being aware of it.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters set their rifles on an elephant.
Nobody does.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom's wife's a canary.
Do you have allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do this.
I'd like to make money.
I'll shake Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom's not a member of this club anymore.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom started to go down.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know Tom was the one who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You're not going to run.
I am Japanese, but I do not live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where have you spent the holidays?
Did you get a Christmas gift from Tom this year?
I still miss my home, and so many things seem strange to me.
I've got some memory problems.
Where's Mum?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little bit off schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi?
Hurry because you're late.
It'll be hard.
Tom always behaves like this?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got a driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So Mary felt sorry.
I'm just watching the news now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, but Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
I'm all late, except for me.
Stop!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on rocking the boat.
Money won't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
Have you been to work?
What do you teach?
I'm sorry they ate those bastards.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom goes to a party tonight.
I said.
She was heading to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language is comparable to a tree that develops over time, esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he has to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We're going on foot.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you say that I was joking?
So it was terribly boring.
Tom said I'm good.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I need to do a lot of things today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the garbage out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's always great.
It'll be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
That's his obstinate idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom's got a son-to-Doctor.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything to do with headaches?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play outside with his friends.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary messages.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus was on her way.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder than it seemed to do.
Her friends ridiculed her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
The aliens are coming and taking away our work, the Earth for the Earth, the Martian!
Don't worry.
Bell invented a phone in 1876.
You're going by train?
Tom said Mary was nice.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
That's why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and never returned.
Collect your toys together.
It was much harder than it seemed to do.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom says to you.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Are you done?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but as tall as my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love trains.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom's painting well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy and can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I have a fever.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think someone's listening?
There's no need for luck!
Tom, you could say, nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go early.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is, solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do I say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom's wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you were speaking French.
I did what I could.
No, sir, she's nice.
I'm very interested in studying French.
Be good to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
You got a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're pleased with your job.
Are you working around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I got business tomorrow.
I'm not careful.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, but I don't get used to it.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person that Tom is talking about in general is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
She was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom is okay.
I'm not well asleep.
Don't you buy it?
Women are nice.
wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I have a problem with night sleep.
Tom's sometimes upset me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you're going to have a cheaper night in us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair became thinner and thinner.
Yesterday, my sister went to Kobe.
Don't you speak in terms of experience?
He loves ice cream.
I was hungry.
What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I do.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch a rabbit.
All dogs are faithful.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so happy.
Tom and Mary both are very upset.
Will you not stay with us?
It's Communism.
This is where the river is suddenly narrowing down.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do that.
Tom is a very practical person.
I've got a good motherfucking.
I need political asylum.
It was cozy after the storm.
There is no easy way to succeed.
Here's the train.
He loves tigers.
It's raining, so we can't do this.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
You okay?
