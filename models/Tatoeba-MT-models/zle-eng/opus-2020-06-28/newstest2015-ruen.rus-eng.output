FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANR) will jointly hold the third Expert Session, “Assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year, reports to the press release entitled “Lenta.Ru”.
The third meeting is scheduled to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to establish a summary of indicators for the assessment of the impact of scientific organizations.
Some participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the assessment of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the conduct of the assessments.
The third expert session will be a final event in the afternoon of events to create a unified approach for all three Academys to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in doing so, and the final version of the normative instruments is at agreement.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the development of the science-based and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation,” said Russian Federation Chief of the Expert Analysis Office, Elena Aksenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutions of Russia.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. in Moscow on 16 September 2014 at home 14.
Scientists Found a Way to Find Relative Stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied the disturbing mixing and its impact on chemical uniformity in star-based fossils.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow the stars to be found in the same cluster.
The authors published the findings of their studies in Nature magazine, and they are available briefly on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is caused by the disturbing mixing in the clouds of gas prior to the creation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves a star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birth place and the region of creation of the stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from relatives in the cluster.
Modelling results from astrophysics show that these differences should not appear.
In its study, experts using a supercomputer modeled two fluxes of intersonic gas that formed a cloud together.
This facility has been transformed into a cluster for several million years by its own gravity, in which protosthetics begin to form.
Scientists added tag paints to the original gas streams and found that high levels of chemical uniformity were achieved through rapid emotional mixing.
Astrophysicists believe that their study proves that we can look for chemical stars, as well as identify possible regions for the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20-year-olds after the high-speed motorcycle.
The motorcycle was confiscated after passing 125 km/h at a speed of 70 km/h and through the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbar.
A police patrol in Carrat tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that his speed was 125 km/h when he left a service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcycle did not stop and continued on the Berjess Road, then took it off to the Bushland, causing the police to lose sight of it.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were seen next to the house on Walcott Wae in Bulgar.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and lead dangerously.
It must be brought before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

TT-204 investigations completed in Vnukovo in 2012
The Russian Investigation Committee has completed an investigation into the criminal case of the TT-204 aircraft crash at Vnukov Airport in December 2012.
This was reported to the UK of the Russian Federation today.
“The Moscow Interregional Investigation Authority on Transport of the Russian Investigation Committee has completed an investigation into a criminal case initiated in the event of a TG-204 accident at Vnukov Airport on 29 December 2012, on the basis of the offence provided for in article 2, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code / violation of the rules of traffic safety and the operation of air transport resulting in the unnecessary death of two or more persons/”, states a report by the Department.
The cause of the disaster was the failure of the crew to comply with the standard procedures and the increased speed of landing.
George Webster is charged with rape in hotels in Nyrena and Pitlokhri
The man will be tried for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28 years old, was charged during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
Apparently, he raped a woman at the Scotlands Hotel in Pitlochri, Perthshire County, on 7 June 2013.
Webster was said to have attacked her when she was "without consciousness, slept and unable to give consent."
Webster is also accused of rapeing another woman at the Glof Wew Hotel in Neairne, North-Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Lady Ray appointed a hearing before the High Court in Edinburg on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not "kick the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave WTO.
Russia won't go to the door because of the new sanctions.
Today, the head of the TRI, Sergey Lavrov, spoke to the MIGMO students and teachers.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Rosian sanctions, I will not even discuss, fantasize, because everything must be specifically targeted, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like about this once, then we'll decide how to respond to it.
This will not involve the cotton of doors, some kind of insults, the false ones, the Minister has stressed.
First of all, we will resist our interests, interests to protect our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of partners to ensure their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by the partners, the continued chapter of the MID REF.
If they say that they're also painful for us, but we have to go to that to punish Russia," that's probably not very adequate.
As regards WTO ' s withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to be more actively involved in the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolbox to overcome, we believe, the discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of demping anti-dumping measures against the RF industries.
“We are prepared to contribute to the WTO mechanisms and in order to defend our position of non-inhibiting the third energy package of the EU, retrospectively”, said Lavrov.
How can we use cheese in garden design?
The question is answered by Irin Okunewa:
Since the syringes lose their basic appeal after their bloom, they are desirable to plant with other artisans.
It's perfectly connected to a lot of cultures.
In addition to the cheese, plants that are ornamented with and flowering can and should be planted at the same time.
Another plus sirens is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a stambble tree of varying heights, improved shrubs, broad-based bushes, and even the likeness of a garden bosa, a tree with an amazingly embroidered trunk.
Just choose the form that matches more the design of your garden.
In Kareliya, a man in Leningrad province was convicted of selling counterfeit money.
According to a report in the Republic ' s Ministry, a man was involved in his criminal activities in the Olonnetsk and Ségges district.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already been able to inherit from the Volgorod region, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment last spring.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonnet District Court.
In order to end the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, Segejo has been phased out.
In the course of the investigation, a number of episodes of sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013 have been proven guilty.
In late June of this year, the criminal case files and indictments were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court ruled that the term of imprisonment should be replaced by a four-year term, with a general regime.
The sentence did not enter into legal force.
Recall, last week, two more counterfeit money dealers were convicted of paying them at Petrozingsk shops.
Azerbaijan's citizens also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of liberty for five years, the other four.
Each has a fine of 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into legal force.
At Archangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the first horse, Dervis.
The rally, which took place at the regional center, was devoted to the first Arctic horse.
Durish delivered military assistance from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In the Archangelic Memorial, memory was held in a post-memorial monument to the northern convoy, located on the coast of Sedov in Solombal.
The meeting was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children of the Cadet class.
For the first time, we were gathered twenty-three years ago when a foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, it's not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who didn't return to the sea," said the chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Sea Railway.
The event was followed by an orchestra of the city, and the students of the Cadet class gave the veterans flowers and missed Russia’s flags and the sign of victory.
Myting ended by placing flowers on a bookmarked stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of molded boots, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, there were also military equipment on board ships and weapons - 3,800 deep-rooted bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrickin fighter aircraft in a de-disclosure state.
At the same time, the convoy was equipped with 16 WIF ships, of which two were aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not discovered by the enemy and reached its destination, Archangelska.
A total of 848 vessels that took part in vital caravan operations lost 126 transport and about 50 military vessels.

Aware of the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressman Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
“Where trade unions and middle-class jobs are,” says Allison, a democracy from Minnesota, co-chairing the Congress of the Progressive Federation.
That's why I'm proud to present the Employment Rights Act with a symbol of the Civil Rights Movement, John Lewis.
This innovative draft law will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, by stopping the forces of trade unions ' opponents
The amendment of the Employment Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers who are discriminated against in union organizations to seek justice in civil courts and to obtain compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least on American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis, and the sponsors of the bill are to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks of trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states around the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still recall when that country at the same time defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the paramilitary autocracy of Hideki Tojá was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collectively be guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that publicly read: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and profession or activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to restrict this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be deemed unlawful.
When former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend his or her interests”.
Generations of Americans have taken as a good basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the union should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and that their voices are heard in a free and open society.
Like Reverend Martin Luther King Junior said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the forces of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the living level of millions, trade unions had miraculously set up a market for industry and raised a whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions are long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are building up ideals that have historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily locks down a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the introduction of the Luizian Act on Sunday, about which his supporters say he will probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Luizian Bobby Jiadall in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who have abortions would have been required to have the authority to receive patients to the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions so far, while continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be permitted to work legally while continuing to act upon their credentials," wrote Judge John de Grevells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled for a month in which the judge will render a more permanent decision on the Act.
Protectors of the right to abortion were happy to see this decision, the last one against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“The present decision guarantees that the women of Luiziana will be protected from the penal law, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a claim for the suspension of the law from the face of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether a decision was made to doctors from two clinics who were not the plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The right to abortion fighters, together with the American College of Psychiatrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on admissions impose restrictions on doctors that are not essential to medicine.
Abortion opponents object that these measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who makes abortions in Louisiana had the authority to take hospital visits, reported the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other medical doctors in the state were to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, afraid for his safety, would stop doing the procedure, reported the group.
In criticism of this decision, Luizian officials said that they would not punish doctors who performed abortions while their applications for decision-making powers were pending.
This will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product must be Russian-producing trade-related networks, and the “Equitable Russia” Faction of the Oleg Nilov is considered by the Deputy of the State of the Republic of Lithuania.
The Parliament has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, reports the newspaper “Investigation”.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case with goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> In the remaining groups of products produced in Russia, the Riteler will be required to provide at least half of its branches to domestic producers,” reported the Nile publication.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of public regulation of trade in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for a revision to the Tax Code, which establishes a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent in the delivery of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic goods on the counters.
However, experts say that the initiative can have both positive and negative effects.
According to the lawyer for Nalogic, a member of the independent public think centre, Sergey Lithuanianenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
They'll have farmers, farmers, small stores.
They'll be able to sell more, which means profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their products.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget income, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some speed up, contribute to GDP growth.
The dependence of Russia on foreign food will drop several times, in fact, not immediately," the expert points out.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to access local shops because of high competition on the part of foreign analogies.
Now, after the embargo has been imposed, it has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will receive food products after all the necessary harmonization and sanitation checks on the Russian market.
In other words, it's now a "morture moment" when the old players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month, there was an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as increased prices for finished products,” said AIF.ru, First Vice-President of the Pan-Russian Public Organization, “Russian Club of Financial Directors”, by Tamar Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would make it possible to consolidate the sector with local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were at the expense of subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer's struggle will be developed between companies working under the single laws of the industry.
On the other hand, notes Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to “draw” the share of Russian goods up to half the range.
In this regard, there is a growing concern that scaffoldings will receive non-quality goods.
The expert adds, perhaps under the view of products produced in Russia, that would be delivered by foreign products carrying transfused ethics.
Large trade networks, especially those that are better off cooperating with importers, are affected by the negative effects of quotas.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this kind of layout, as demand for their products will decline.
Lithuania does not exclude that the domestic quota law may affect consumers as well.
The point is that some of the products of Russian production may be treated as import analogies, while the shops can charge prices for the second as a deficit.
The fact that economists had been forgotten in the early 2000s was again spoken of by economists in February this year as a result of the continued devaluation of rouble.
Now, in the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importing products has become even more urgent.
The Act is intended to require miners to be considered domestic producers when establishing orders from suppliers.
At that time, we are much faster and more confident about importing, and the production planning system for the required products will be established within a shorter time frame,” says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering up Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can be generated in a powerful way.
The largest share of imports is known to be in beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
And it turns out that 65-70% of them are Russian products, and they're talking about Kasianova.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products helps and can accelerate the import process.
However, this initiative will not, in itself, lead to imports, as it requires a set of measures, which Lithuania is certain to do.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad and thus no full imports would occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
It was also necessary to establish quotas, and production of domestic products was still needed to meet those quotas.
These quotas are the ones that will provide such guarantees,” noted the expert.
Untempored diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment mean that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolly and her brother, James, published a video of the memory of their deceased mother who died of egg cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from egg cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers examined the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarians in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent of them had lived five years after diagnosis.
The leading researcher, Susan Jordan, of the QIGR Berggofer Institute of Medical Studies, reported that the risk of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in the regions and remote locations of the state than those living in urban areas.
NEARLY RESEARCH: New medicines can slow lung cancer and egg cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the risk of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from egg cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment were possible.
"It's the disease that's being treated best by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they're mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes far away from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the long life expectancy of women with egg cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ried to Conquer cancer will be published today at the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elyne Nive, said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open up in the Kugener district.
The construction of a health facility in the village of Tokaybela was initiated in April this year and was a typical project.
The work cost just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Communications and Information, funding for the construction of the site was funded by the national budget under the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the preventive and treatment facility is almost 230 square metres.
Medical assistance will be provided to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Tokkaybelak and the villages of Denomjevo, Püncherymal, Tunya, Fomchi, Toraybalak, Shinar and Chakalal.
The new Feldsher-Akusher post will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long been exhausted and its premises do not meet sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in an irregular state, a newcomer will be brought to trial
A Chuwashai resident will appear on the dock of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboxares, a criminal investigation was completed against a 31-year-old resident of Novocobsarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with his four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birth of the child at Chebbarsara.
After a long stay, the newcomer decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a barren woman placed it next to her bed to feed her chest, but soon afterward she fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell upon her son, killing him from the strangler.
The criminal case, reports the U.S.R.'s press service on Chuvashiya to the court.
Inflation's out of leave.
Do the rose - in - the - price increases make you feel?
As a result of cross-substitution sanctions between the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not be reflected in the authorities' forecasts, convinced by WTB Capital analysts.
Experts believe that the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will result in an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes the RBC Daily.
Inflation is projected to be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014, less than 6.5 per cent in next year.
However, according to the newspaper Commersant, this week the IEA should make “a small but principled” adjustment to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can reduce the estimates of inflation for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected accumulation of incomes.
It was projected that the food sanctions of the FM were in force one year before August 2015.
How could such inflation be envisaged?
The current situation implies a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change,” said a newspaper source in Minsk.
Economists from WTB Capitala do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic embargo on inflation and anticipate an 8 per cent increase in prices in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction of sales tax (NSP) in 2015 in the Fed regions are the experts.
An inflation peak of 9 per cent will be required in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will fall, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the FM introduced “active sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the FK Analysis Department, Forex:
Price increases have already been observed in major segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products were valued, the Government was forced to launch price stability systems to avoid the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
The suppliers and dealers are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulators, so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, is initiating price increases.
The high capital outflow rates, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian Megareguator continue to be key factors in the growth of the consumer price index, the internal conversion of the population due to the flight into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries joining sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure were to remain under control, the value of the basket of the minimum set of products would not have risen by 12 per cent in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of food has triggered the shock of supply in the domestic market and has led to a completely logical increase in final value.
Since, at this stage, we are not fully able to launch the import mechanism and to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, responsible sanctions will continue to carry the risk of growth of the inflationary component.
If the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth were added here, by the end of this year inflation could well exceed 8 per cent.
Alexander Réviv, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflation sometimes reached between 20 and 30 per cent per month in the 1990s, zero was also above the current level, and another was offset by rapid economic growth.
Inflation would be 8 - 8.5 per cent after the year.
Plato Magut, who manages the UK assets of the Magut Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being delayed successfully, but if pressures continue to increase, above all on the financial sector, it may lead to some difficulties and an increase in the inflation expectations of the population, which are traditionally reflected in the purchase of cash currencies in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CB of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will endeavour to mitigate the smooth reduction of roubles, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But prices begin to rise traditionally after a summer’s eclipse, and perhaps this fall will become more visible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is likely to stand at 7.5 per cent, as the FF still has financial savings.
Gardening centres mourn the decline of homeowners
Such a decline, due to an exceptional decline of less than 35 years in homeowners, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers have reached the “core age of horticulture”, according to a study of the Financial Times.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners spend on horticulture.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting in front of the parking house and the decline in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, estimated at 5 billion per year.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest household goods were spent on gardeners.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that housing rents and the lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief horticulture adviser to RHS, said, "The growth of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with renters who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retail goods for horticulture as a result of an increase in homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also suggests that the market will be improved this year by better weather after adverse conditions last March and April.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture conducted mass cleansing at the Landelide Foundation
Three of the four directors of the Landelel Foundation were replaced another Friday.
In total, three of the four directors of the Landellel Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the suspension of the post of Executive Director, Atanas Otwa.
Lozanne Vasile took his place.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been changed to a small extent on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatian Angelov, who has been responsible for public assistance and the APPARD programme, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I was not present at the fund manager's board because we were not members of the management, but they told me later that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the fund website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I'll know more on Monday," said Angel.
Its seat will be occupied by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of Investment Loans in the Central Fund in Landdell in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until now, he has been responsible for direct subsidies for the EU field.
It will be assigned to the site by the Livelidows, who was the head of the Landelde Foundation regional division in the town of Grando-Tinovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of Fund Atige Alieva Vale retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey caused an American diplomat to report on spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called on the highest American diplomat in Turkey to explain the report of the United States and British spy in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent, reported that the American Clerk and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet journal The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence site for the United States and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Rejep Taipe Erdogan, has reduced the importance of this report by saying that all major countries are spying on each other.
Previously reported information that Germany ' s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara a weapon of exploration had led to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The major Chinese companies have united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among them China's largest virgin commercial real estate, are establishing a company that will compete on the market with Alibaba.
However, it will not be easy to catch up with the wonder of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com.
Union of the Majors
Companies plan to put 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70% of it will belong to Wanda and 15% of each of the Internet companies is reported in a report by Wanda Group.
A firm is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Bayu search services with the popular social platform Wechat (the largest social social population in China, with a population of about 438 million), Tenent and Winda ' s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 office hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Cindao, east of China on the Yellow Sea.
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Weda owns the U.S.A.A.A.O.I.A.L.L.I.L.L.L.I., which makes it the largest film operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trade centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-companse services, the development of which will take place as a highly developed competitor, Aliba.
According to Dune Zee, who will lead the new company, it will be possible to increase the number of users of their e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by the following year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Zee.
The point of online-to-offline (O2O) is to engage Internet buyers to come to the regular store store or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the services sold by coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in the online commerce," said the leader of Wanda Van Jiangininin (Bloomberg Citate).
"There is no current O2O site in China today, and in this situation the odds of everyone are roughly equal," he considers.
The Chinese Internet trade market is the largest in the world, and it is estimated by McKinsey & Co. that its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, producing Bloomberg official statistics: more people worldwide, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015 this number could reach 850 million people.
Union of Richest
He was the richest man of China until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Mill, founder Aliba Jack Mae had already beaten him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's position is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is due to his share in Alibabaa.
Baidu Robin Lee is now the third richest people of China, while Van Jianginin of Wanda is the fourth quarter.
"For this battle, it is very interesting to see that three of the richest people unite to challenge even more rich," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for the Study of Electronic Commerce in Hanzhou Tsao Lie.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Abiba immediately after creation, "We can't build Rome in one day."
The fact that Alibabaa is not so easy to compete not only with new companies but also with well-deserved leaders of the world Internet trade is testimony to the published report on the financial performance of Alabama in the last quarter of the year.
Alibabaa is often described as a medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both its American competitors combined.
The net profit of Alibaba over a period of almost twice the same sum total of competitors has risen almost three times annually to $1.99 billion.
"Alibabaa still has great potential for money generation, largely thanks to its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg on the report of the Hong Kong International Research Service analyst.
According to Alibaba ' s updated brochure on the US Security and Exchange Commission ' s website, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July was 188 million, a significant increase over the March figure (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of Alibaba's transactions during the last quarter were made into mobile devices.
Alibabaa has to be named the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Broomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the Bloomberg sources, Aliba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can be held on 16 September.
The Road show company before this event starts on 3 September.
Alibaba's IPO output is expected to be a record date in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the United States exchange record has belonged to the Visa payment system, which held its primary stocking in 2008, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food items in trade networks must be Russian-producing, and members of the Gosdumas are considered to be.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
These include amendments to article 8 of the Fed on the basis of public regulation of trade in the FF and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the draft law, at least 50 per cent of domestic production in shops should be for every kind of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so they will be provided with “big” to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, setting a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for all food products of their country of origin, reports the newspaper “Investigia”.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ Act on Retail Markets, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to market their products.
The Chief of Police of Magalouf has been charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and municipal officials of Calvia to the Public Prosecutor's office on Friday.
The chief of the Calvia police in Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption on the part of businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous centre of the unmarked Malaloufe.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the bars and night clubs of Mahalouf are located.
According to Malorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and municipal officials of Calvia at the Malorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be questioned by the judge, together with Navarro.
ABC, a Spanish daily publication, reported that the unsatisfying owners of night clubs say that protectionism on the part of the authorities has a serious impact on the state of their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen.
Our livelihoods must not be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalouf was in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British rester who took up a score of 24 men running through bars.
The authorities of the island have since tried to put an end to the ill-treatment among Magalouf resters, minimizing the number of scandalous alcoholic runs at bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were collectively fined to €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magalouf, mainly popular among young British resters, was also the site of numerous alcohol-related accidents, such as “balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Aeroport Adelaide
WESSAN prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected the flights to Adelaide Airport.
A further 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm in the Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with broken winds, including a storm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave in the early spring of last week, the temperature fell again Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The prevailing conditions were expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it got into the wind shift zone -- suddenly changing the speed or the direction of the wind at short distances -- and had to gain height.
Wind blasts reached 50 km/h on land at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take up altitudes during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emrights flight from Dubai and the Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday, with either one or two rainfall.
Estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will be revised
Prices, construction regulations, and networking issues are subject to special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has established an expert board to promote competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the Head of Control, Construction and Natural Resources of the FAS, Wadim Soloviev, stated that “the annual estimate of construction projects is totally unclear”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing impracticable and may lead to an unreasonable price for construction, is believed to be in FAS.
And suggest that the cost of public service construction at the design stage be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of the current estimates and the single costs of technological transactions.
These proposals have been put on the road map and are currently under consideration in the mines.
“Replacement of traditional estimates for the construction of the design elements should result in less corruption in the industry,” explained Wadim Soloviev.
Because the estimates now count every bolt and nut, and it's not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, bad building companies can bury the whole tractors.
In the morning, FAS agrees.
“The first work on the cost-accounting exercise has already been made: methodologies have been developed to calculate the price of constructive solutions, and estimates for those indicators,” explained the head of the Department of Urban Planning and Mining, Elena Zuzkov.
As a pilot, the road construction industry.
However, experts feel that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the profi-Inves construction company, Anatoly Demianco, the estimated norm has long since become obsolete, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed design calculations, it is difficult in practice because building buildings often use entirely different technologies”, he considers.
It's no secret that the building house is developing in many ways because of the government order.
According to Ekaterina Lesina, Chairman of the Government of NP, the “Expertive Community of State Professionals” of the State, the State is now the most able to pay.
The Coach of the Industrial Capital Centre, Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov, pointed out that the market is now divided conditionally into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that possess monopoly competences and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believes that the establishment of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is to be guaranteed as far as possible from one of the effects managers.
On the expert board, it was suggested that the State Order system should be established in such a way that the same perpetrator is not entitled to receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion roubles.
In the mines, it is believed that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact of business and the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Joukova explained, it would be necessary to provide the employer with the functions of the genetic contractor, which would result in an increase in the size of the employer and the budget for its maintenance.
In doing so, employers will have to have knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractual organizations, as well as their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the departure of high-quality participants in the public procurement because of a lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The supervisors of the Procurement Institute ' s expert advisory centre, Alexander Eustashekov, believe that the hospital procedure has now become a business game for the contractor ' s attention.
And this is an example of: "the participant in the application must specify "specific indicators" without the words "or equivalent", "to be", "to be", "to be", "less," "analog," "or", "typical type", "not below", "be lower", "might", "might", "maybe", "maybe", "not before," "not "no", "no", "no" etc.
Thus, employers often abuse their right to impose requirements on contracting organizations.
Another problem with the 44-FZ was that, in the view of Eustashenkov, it was necessary to assess the quality of the participant's “paper” proposal at the application stage.
In considering the participant ' s application, it is the expert ' s view that only the contractor ' s qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, can really be assessed.
The quality of the work can only be evaluated when it is received.
On the expert board, it was also suggested that the marginal income from the top to the bottom should be transferred to disappear by intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Board of Experts, the Secretary-General, the head of the FAS, Andrey Kingskovsky, believes that this is not worth doing so, since the company must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, as in the famous revolution of Adria Raykin, "Atel", "How do the Pygians have a claim?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories, near the Gaza Strip, returned to school on Monday, after they had spent the summer in the bombings, when missiles and mines had fallen to their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip had been closed while the Territory had been restored after hostilities.
The beginning of school sessions brought joy and excitement to southern Israeli settlements affected by rockets, but the fighting tracks remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashos children's garden, where the rocket hit, removed traces of shrapnel from the wall and the children's hills before the students arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to see the future," said Ronni Bart, a resident of Kibush Saad, and a English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to their lives.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it's a little weird to start going to school again.
"There was a hard time and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Rivin visited Kibuntz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire came to a halt last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, went out or left their homes, fleeing to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many of the people of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a scrap of a Palestinian mine, doubted that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which had been badly set up by the Palestinian fire.
He told his children to learn carefully and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite armistice last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas ' s demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to commence later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, of whom three quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
In the course of the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan fighters fired 4,591 missiles and mines on Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 aerial and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip had been damaged and destroyed, and it was estimated that 250,000 people had sought refuge in more than 100 schools, which had been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy now living in a school in Gaza.
According to a popular real estate price criterion, the largest winter growth in seven years was shown.
The RP Data Core Housing Index for Housing Prices in the Australian Capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The director of RP Data Tim Lowles reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent over the last year, while in Melbourne, 11.7 per cent.
The next market opportunities were Adelaide, Brisbyin and Darwin, where prices grew from 5 to 6 per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditure reductions were experienced, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowes said that as spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estates sold over the next few months, which would be a “continuing test” for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will still increase in the next three months," he said.
How people live in Ufa's oldest house
In the former home of the gold and mining miners of Evkakim and his son Ivan Demidov on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 (the former Greater Kazanski) 18 apartments.
The home of the 18th century has remained virtually unchanged, except for the weight of a edifice.
Foreigners travel here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they are happy, from their privilege of living in an old secure house, the walls of which are remembered by General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction is inaccurate, and the historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out it's a little 300-year-old building.
Old yard, always open door, violin staircase.
The doors to the apartment are close to each other, the walls are cracking up, and in the glimmers from the muddy plasters of the high street.
I think I'm holding up.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is."
Living in the village house of the 18th century is very difficult, ” says Tatian Lukjanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
It's on the security service, but it's not worth a decade of money, and we feel like museums that the authorities just forgot about.
The last repairs were 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin, but the foundation's gone.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and pray once a week in the public bath.
How can you be content in such circumstances?
The road goes straight under the windows, even the footstep is gone.
Tatiana's pushing the curtain.
Now you can see what was before you could hear — the traffic underneath the windows.
You see, the wires are all the time, the windows can't open, they're used to noise.
Man's used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
That's two rooms, three of us with our son.
And in other families, conditions are much worse, on the second floor, just a little over a mile [1.5 m] high.
To contrast, Tatiana proposes to visit the neighbor of apartment No. 6 Ludmel Oldest.
A kind, hospitable woman on the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one - room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live by our husband and daughter with our granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and I've never had another living room, and Ludmila is surrounded by the eyes of antresoli, two weird "g," one of them has a laptop.
Very close and very little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic."
But there's a regular flow of currents from the ceiling: there's no running water system.
Ludmila says of her apartment in an ordinary and amazing way, like an Italian woman whose home stands in the ruins of Rome.
I mean, one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was carried out some 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then I made us a little kitchen in the back of the room and a toilet from the ex-heart.
We live just where Damid and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
Ufa's Real Estate Centre says privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
It was four months ago that we were promised to settle down, but the next thing we had promised was no more.
I don't get used to complaining and not getting used to it.
In this apartment (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandmother and Grandpa, my mother and Dad, and my husband and my daughter, with their lips.
Everything's been going on during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flue, they're about three feet thick!
They say the solution was mixed in eggs, so it's been holding up for so long.
The house is well built, thank you, Damidov!
Maybe that's why it's not until no one's been killed by a broken ceiling or by his own.
Only the building still slowly dies in our eyes: the planks and the log of the house rot, the fields have fallen, we have filled with cement, but everything is useless -- the solution goes to the ground like a well.
They say it's a secret walk under our room and a walk to the White River, which used to make some old-timers living here so they could escape the danger, if anything.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starsten tells us how a historian came to them, begged him to start digging in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them a house in exchange for his one-way for the October raid.
Sophia's story says,
Where are we supposed to be?
But there's a bit of hope here that they're going to give the housing a little bit more simple.
We're going to exchange, nothing's gonna win.
In fact, the Old Men's family won't and won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be settled, and a 16-year-old daughter gave her a room.
I mean, two families have been given a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
The cute, miniature girl, Oleya Carsakova, of flat Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, a large family lives in two close rooms with a total of 23 m2, called apartments.
We're seven people, two kids.
You see what the conditions are.
The stuccuation is moved away with pieces like window frames, in the kitchen walls and in the rooms of through-hole holes.
It's only cold water in the tap around the year.
As you walk through Uf's oldest apartment, you can make sure that most of them were lucky to the wives of Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spaced rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of places!
75 squares, three people are registered.
We live in just those rooms where Suvrov had a legend of staying in Ufe, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitieric Lavrentev.
The ceilings are tall, simple.
One bad thing is, everything's cracking down, falling apart, falling.
I think you've already told me!
Most of the torments we had with the floors: wooden boards were burned, the ground was literally coming from under our feet.
I've put a sticker, a blade; there's nothing else in the hall; and in the other room, we're walking like we're rocking, that's all.
The house of the merchant Evdakim Demidov, Alexander Dmitrijevic, is better known than any guide.
The gold industry is considered a native, and it is admired.
Indeed, the identity of the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzian factories was a building of houses, guns and colosses were poured out, and the mines were being held.
The successors of the merchant real estate are proud, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I lived here as a child, in the 1940s, in the twentieth century, says Alexander Dmitrijevic.
At that time, there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and caravans, which were then demolished.
In 1968, we wanted to clean up our house, but something interfered...
History was repeated in 2014: Once again, new housing was stolen.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran away from the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment would be 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortstan to learn about the fate of the house.
The residents did not accept it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a joke, handed out a sandwich without signature and press, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the settlement of the tenants."
I even have this feeling that our house has been out of town for a long time, because it was in number 57 first, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had already been removed in the 1970s.
The "Russia Planet" launched a land administration information and analysis work for Ufa Vladimir Barabash, the lead sector.
A house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in a programme for the settlement of a comfortable home.
I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan at that time to demolish all old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not been the case, and the decision of modern authorities to restore all old homes in the streets of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are about to settle over new apartments shortly.
According to Barabash, Italian specialists who had participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice would restore the House of Demid.
Italy now has a architectural binenel, and the Star Ufa project is being presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire Old Kazan Street will be restored, the official says.
The house will acquire an appropriate species corresponding to the one it used to be three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all who wish.
It was also decided at the Government level to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, there's no way out of the building, too much traffic in the city.
The future museum of Vladimir Barabas promises people in 2015.
In fact, they are unlikely to be content, and their new apartments will be the same as the current one.
It's only from another era.
A forest fire started in the Primoria due to a storm
The dry storm caused forest fires on the territory of the Metropolitan Landing in the Porá district of Primorje.
A build-up of forces and assets is taking place at the site of the fire.
According to the authorities of the CGGB, the Primor Airbases, which created conditions at the site of fire, require the deployment of aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, deputy chief of airbase:
A fire in difficult terrain found an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft covering 3 hectares.
The remains of the old burner are burned.
The heavy surface debris and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of impactable fire ponds, create significant difficulties in the dithering.
The MI-8 helicopter is required.
The supply of force by a MI-2 helicopter and an AN-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Following the detection of fire, 4 parachutist firemen were quickly removed from the carbohydrates.
The main objective of the specialists is firefighting and the preparation of a site for the delivery of additional fire-fighting forces and equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 fire squads were added to the area of the village of Ochotnica by helicopter.
Once a helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be moved to the scene of the crash and reported on the website of the authorities of the Primor province.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrant families from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing the comedy, Rudi's rare plates, which are partly based on supposed conversations with his father and grew from a series of Radio 4.
Soundtrek is a mixture of trades and raps, and the tunes are life-survivors.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother’s death, he had a “many” treatment, and Henry often thought about his father’s relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice say:
Get off your sister.
Move!
I want to watch a scream.
My older brothers, Seimur and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, walked with him in pubs and talked about things such as the form of a beer glass, the beauty of a scream.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a sickly boy in a corner that I read to the newspaper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a ski shop in Dudley, and although conditions were better than those of his father, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
It's a bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep-down mazes with flashes of fire, smoke, and soot.
My father went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself because he wanted to get rid of the skits.
When I got there, I realized he was doing this for years and years to earn our food, and I began to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry was no longer a child of parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop huging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Frank, where he was married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I'm really, really rectified and I have diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical steps.
At that time, I started a serious phytensian exercise, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career path change is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since his confession of critics for his Otello, he's been totally in the theater.
After "Cumme Mistakes" and then "Cares" by Ogasta Wilson.
This work is different from stecoma and comedium, which were an integral part of its productive professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 years old and worked at a factory.
DJ noticed how he would start on the stage, and he wrote about it in "New Faces."
His television career began in the mid-seventies, "I've been the only black parody on television for a very long time."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective car to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, which was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Because his manager had the right to "The Black and White Revelts," a light entertainment program in which people had "done their face", Henry found out he'd been in it for five years.
My family really didn't like it.
I kind of want it never to be with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemned position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the successful award of a light entertainment class on British television for years and years” was also a “grote parody on black people”.
I think of the characters who used to mock the culture of black people in Britain, and who were good at it, Henry was working in an alternative comedian project in the 80s.
The first season of Shaw Lennie Henry was broadcast in 1984, and he was known in the virgins as, among other things, Chief Garet Blackock from the "Shef" cartoon series.
Advertisements, documentary films, TV series and movie role took the next ten years of his life, but after his TV show on BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What you're going to do next, Len, because a lot of it seems like you're pulling your time or you're turning yourself away."
And then there was a series of documentary programs on Radio 4, called "What's Good at..."
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
You can't tell me how much I've been taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of the white people of the middle class, with the texter and the hood on the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we took interviews for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, judi Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't hurt it until you know what you're talking about.
Do some of these words aloud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry spent 20 lines of his last Otello monolo for documentary transmission, and he got caught.
I felt like I could do that.
Somehow my head's been fixed.
"What it is, it's a serious matter, taking it seriously, learning your text, and doing a little research.
So, the repatriation process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to wait for the catastrophe, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Media Errors."
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Technical confusion developed, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're doing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the submission would resume once the problem had been resolved.
I left the stage and said in me, "Thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else figure this out.
"You play the play game, stay the role."
Henry's at the Daches Theatre in the Zabor.
It was difficult to learn the text for "Corners."
The panic is quite useful, but it strengthens the musculature.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign above saying, "That's what you need to do."
He says this, of course, with a grand voice.
So I'm holding on to this.
I really love it.
I love being in the tutoring room.
By the way, Henry's still thinking about a comedian -- the whole way we're talking about is the outbreaks of his humor when he starts, and he's finished breeding.
I just decided not to work on the stand, because this thing with the immediate pay for the entire room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're looking forward to it all the time, it can be a dead end.
I sometimes work in the Apollo Air Force when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he's going to get a standup tour sometime.
It's a joy to sit in the director's room, which helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road -- I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So that's his new idea?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began the biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, reported in the Government ' s application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left the public service.
President Ouhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in State structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ( phrase700000) per month was due to the payment of “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to go to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Vanyama Chebusiri, reporter of the BBC, from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to appear within the next two weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without reasonable reason will be excluded from the statement of payment.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of government, thereby ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wyguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Restructuring of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers were arrested in connection with the “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “a conspiracy against the Government” and reported to local news agencies.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Herrriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities last December, which were aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Rjep Taipe Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) identified them as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic Clyk Fetholah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
The schools in most Ukraine again opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big occasion for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Artina Yatstenuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had been opened again, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held at every school in the first September.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, which is hugely united in the Ukrainian People ' s Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastachov, the principal of the school in Saviansk, who went to Jacenek's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of the study is traditionally observed by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
Ron Fairhead's face may have found the kind of intrusive head she needs.
It is followed by a certificate of glory from the world of banking, media administration and the domestic community of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at the Bain and Co global consulting firm, and then continued at Morgan State, Bambadier, ICI, and in the world media in Pedsons.
She's been the head of the Financial Times for seven years when she retired when a lower male colleague from the top of Pedson's post.
Her earnings are said to be close to 1 million.
Her political rating is also missing.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became Cabinet Adviser.
Her husband is a former counselor of Tori.
Previously in May, I named the chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox within its structure.
The Council has two aims: inside it is the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but I am also referring to the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duepolity that requires a complete radical reform.
But what new Chairman would risk to come, melting and destroying the institution as difficult as Chinese dynasties if he himself left himself behind in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be so difficult, many people would be happy to see BBC drop in size, after a review of its authority, finance and status.
As competitors narrow their circles and new technologies to meet the conveniences of old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a licence pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest sum of ✔14.550, Britishs are making their share in the world’s greatest media business.
BBC tells a good story: She states that the results of her work cover 96 per cent of households and are only 40p per day for each of them.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb’s popularity is increasing, with 53 per cent supporting it today, compared with 31 per cent 10 years ago.
BBC's views and uses have changed, and now I'm getting news headlines on my mobile phone and watching missing programs on an iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an inspiring chairman. I hope he found him.
Perry, from Texas, says that the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside the country.
The Twitter from the confirmed actuary of the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, in the Sunday night contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the democracies, who is at the criminal prosecution centre for the abuse of power.
The Twitter was later removed, followed by another one from the Perry Akunt, where the record was declassified.
I just had my account published a Twitter that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this Twitter, and I took it away," says a later recording.
The Assistants of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the records were loaded with the confirmed acceptance of Perry, it was not clear who was actually engaged in the publication of the tape.
The earlier Twitter contained an impermissible cartoon on Travis Rosemary Lemberg County Prosecutor, who found him guilty of intoxicating in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the President in the 2016 election.
Signature in Twitter says, "I don't always drive an intoxicated car three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do this, I charge Governor Perry for saying that."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
Lemberg's department did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They were known as Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a police judge.
Perry didn't confess himself guilty and called the charges a political catch.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law which was used to prosecute the governor who had performed his duties longer than all of Texas's history was not in keeping with the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is engaged in the prosecution of corruption in the public sector in Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto has given rise to a formal complaint by a left-wing community control group.
The sheet of confirmed Perry account is frequently updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When he came to the party's fifth in Ayov, during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could leave the game by publishing a picture of himself running near the lake, and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkley reports that the real estate market has returned to “normal” conditions.
One of London's most well-known developers warned that the real estate market in south-east England had “turned” to normal level of activity.
Home in the capital was the subject of lively demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that a credit bubble would encourage Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and president of the Berlin building company on Monday, said, "From the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013," adding that this has ensured a “stable working environment”.
The London Real Estate Market had fallen since foreign buyers had moved to the capital.
The prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent in one year alone, according to the Earth ' s Inventory, significantly extinguished the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, accessible and student schemes of Berkley grew by about one fifth last year, reaching a level at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “Land on the private sector” before the general election in the next May.
Last week, the London Real Estate Agency warned that April ' s reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent loan terms, would also reduce the market growth of both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
Recent data from Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in the number of mortgages approved in June, with further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its 2015 projection of the price of London real estate to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to decline.
In the meantime, transactions dropped by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayer and Kensington, according to WA Elis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital was very good for Berkley, raising sales to exceed ?2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for good design and best location has remained the same, and reflecting it, sales have been retained for a long time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year before the end of April, almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual tax return rose by 40 per cent compared with the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the expected income of Beerkeley for that year would be consistent with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, income is expected all year before the payment of the taxes in $450 million.
Berkley's share value was kept on "23.96" in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Photographs of dedicated Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual American Film Award ceremony.
The photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Prize, were taken from the Internet by hacker, who claims to have a directory of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Cold Games star confirmed that the pictures of Lawrence were real and condemned hackers for “the gross invasion of personal space”.
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted and they will prosecute anyone who will publish stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo exchange site of 4han were allegedly obtained by a lack of online custody of Apple iClaud, and the alleged hacking “directory” includes the names of dozen women of art, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kayt Olsen, according to BuzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are real, though the star "Scotta Pilgrim Against All", Winstead in Twitter, also condemned the hacking.
"The one who looks at the pictures we have taken with our husband a few years ago when we're alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justin of Nickolodon's series "iCarly" and "Victor's Victoria" denied that in photographs she wrote in Twitter, "These are so-called pictures of the naked FalSHIVIK, people.
Let me stop it in the womb.
Buzzefed said last Sunday that Aryan Grande's pop-star representative denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be real were real.
An exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that praised critics
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is, they were gradually falling apart like a potato box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, he was too hard to communicate, that he was tense, that she was closed, and that perhaps he was a little irritated.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability of himself.
He was a barbecue, yeah.
The last victim of this thorny affair was a little novel from which he waited more than usual to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some pleasure.
Eileen Solomons was trembling at a fragile beauty with broken hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more distant and severe than Port Royben.
She came south with her younger companion, whom Kevin considered to be her aunt, and she inherited a home in her grey, but a paradise-like valley called the "Rah Valley."
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes, which kept the spiders steady in the baths, left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them, and the garden rose with shirts that looked like giant papas.
It was like a cottage in a baby book, and it was a scary and charming garden with a complete secret garden.
Look at the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Long-Ling of the Boukerov Prize in 2014.
The St. List will be announced next week.
Kevin and Eileen sat by their hands, in broken sewing among the tall grasses, enjoying an unexpected warm spring day; they both crowded together to a cheap console, which provided the country with dying music and comforting news, when he looked at its broken brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer, who loved to listen to his father, having dropped the curtains in his house.
You have too big legs.
Because of their current aggression, songs of this kind on the console no longer lost.
They were not forbidden - nothing was forbidden - they didn't lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archical."
The taste of the public was that which could never have been reached by orders and regulations, and that of the books, people chose the memoirs of the rich people who had grown up in poverty, the culinary books, and the love affair, and the music they chose the ballads.
Upon learning this day, Kevin began to play an imaginary piano and a rough comical voice to see Eileen’s big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pioneer song, named Fates Waller," he told her, machinely putting two fingers on her lips.
That's how his father always did it to stop the letter "J" before she flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a fun game at the time, and it wasn't fun right now.
He knew it was coming from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard it.
Jazz didn't play, either, even though he wasn't explicitly forbidden.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
We'll get the same kind of sense.
His unpredictability was on the part of people who were nervous.
Jazz was an acute expression of music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Mladsche, Kevin knew about a jerze from a & CD-ROM semi-censor.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fates Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The Society was obedient, which meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were spared the fate - with the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent for speed and physical characteristics were good for entertainment and sports, and they were drinking and running.
Indostan, as if of nature, talented in all the electronics, made it possible for no family to be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done in san technical works; what was left of the Greek was the barrel of the plate.
The inhabitants of the Persian Gulf and Léwant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when, TO WHAT THE CHALLENGER, THE FAILING PROCEED, they feared being accused of inflammating flames, in fact, of the fear that the flame would swallow them next, opened restaurants with labl and kales, and they would not hang out and sink away from their pitfalls.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only the talk before, Eileen found it hard to understand how the offensive words that he had just read to her Kevin could have been placed on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevin.
Maybe for people with big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that he was running gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the sound insulation of giant leaves that looked like hoods.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to push two fingers back to her lips.
That's how she thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She didn't trust her head while closing a review of Cvern.
There was nothing in the world but a dig of her black hair.
Nothing he would like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
I thought she was really upset.
Do I have my feet too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could've said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I've got this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the comforting promise that could mitigate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he too, Kevin, wanted to.
Despite my good eyes.
Eileen Solomons got painted and got up from the schizollus, challenged the console, and poured the wine they drank.
Wine from the bush, so his drinking could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be rocking like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you precisely because you have your stupid head," she said...
I don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that she felt when she gave him back.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern Archipelago, where she grew up, but he did not doubt that, in the main features, she looked like the one she did.
The same huge ice ocean struck both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after the fact that they were killed, were more likely than their ancestors, smugglers and robbers to wander out of the pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who would dare to refuse them or hurt them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, the kiss was now the most common expression of emotional irritability between a man and a woman; the resistance to the press ballads that gave the console, to kiss it first and then to strike it.
Further clarification, according to Kevin, is because kissing yourself has already been a thrifty.
Eileen Solomons showed him he had to leave.
He got up from the shazelonk like an old man.
She felt the lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him walk away, her companion was a man who had himself taken a load.
Adam, who's leaving the garden, thought about it.
She felt the pain of compassion for him and for the men in general, even though some of them raised their hand on him.
A man who turned away from her, with his back crumpled, whittled, broken, all her ability to fight left him--why did she think she knew it so well, if she couldn't remember a single case, until today when she saw it?
Aileen Solomons again looked at his feet.
Twenty years before or near the events described above, Essma Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal public sentiment control service, prepared a small report on maintaining a low and medium-sized level of violence in those parts of the country where it was expected that it would be reduced if not entirely, taking into account the means and forces allocated for its eradication.
“Many things have been done, and much has been done”, she wrote, “to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in thousands of wars and benefited most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow scattered areas, where, despite the circumcision of churches, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities proved to be immodest.
The higher the pins it would seem, the lower the passions it creates.
The population shed tears over sentimental ballads, ran through stories of overcome obstacles and announced its dusty belief in a virtue of marriage and family life, but not only did the old rudeness keep its heavy grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there was evidence that a new and vicious jealousy in homes, in workplaces, on roads and even in playgrounds.
"You have a pretty habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the report completely.
I think you should read smaller novels.
Emsme Nussbaum put his head down.
I also have to ask you, you're an atheist.
"I think I don't have to answer," Esme Nusbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Assem again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some of the hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in itself, may at times distort results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you're pretentious against the church yourself, and what you call "feeling" and "fucking," others would interpret it as an expression of natural life and energy.
Continue to be bored with the fact that the country had been deprived of the necessary life force, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday.
Emsme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabsinitz spoke.
In his head, the pinks, like the flamingos, repeated the advices that Ofnaou gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, price your spouse, listen to the talkers, walk to musicals, talk on the phone, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," serene Esme Nussbaum replied when she made sure that her scientific manager had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't cured as effectively as we're convincing ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not prepared, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that led to what we originally said, if we are not prepared.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust away from others.
Luther Rabinitz joined his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "whores are the ones who have done or didn't do our grandfathers.
You go too far, and when you say they threw their "fires" and "untrust" on "others."
There is no need for a human to be reminded that when we understand the past, we are not talking about us and others.
There was no "us" and there were no "others".
It was a time of unrest -- that's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," dared to insert Escé, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done, it was done.
Then it was then.
We don't have to say anything anymore, we agree here.
And how you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify yourself if it's appropriate or if you could fix something.
But what's past, if not for learning --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one word to this,
Luther Rabinica’s pyramics collapsed.
"I shall consider your report," he said, leaving her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle who went on the sidewalk, as described by passersby, "in vicious rage."
The coincidences happen.
Lesotho stated that the coup had not been planned; the Prime Minister remained in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied the preparation of a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police who had been suspected of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army had surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in the capital city of Maser.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt at his life.
Major Nttele Ntoi, a representative of the army, said that there was no coup, but that the army responded to the threat of political fanatics, whom the police tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action, having received several intelligence reports, that there are some elements among the police that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to set up chaos,” he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Even though no one has filed claims for the taking of power by force, it is reported that the activities of the Lesotho armed forces have to date had major signs of a coup,” he said.
The elements of the Lesotho army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjo Metzing manages the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June when Taban suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his joint Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.
Marco van Ginkel's half-guard will hold the upcoming season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutch man will come to Italy in the next hour for medical examinations.
In the past season, he left for a field in the London Club only three times.
Let's recall that Milan used to rent the Liverpool of the attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate of 13 months
The growth in eurozone was slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business index (PMI) of the eurozone on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 points to growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan by the bank on how to deal with the recovery of the eurozone, as well as with the threat of deflation at inflation of just 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the head of the ECB, Mario Dragi, may later this week give further signals that he is considering a scheme of quantitative mitigation for the eurozone, similar to those used by Great Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Even though growth is better than growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers becomes more apparent," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of Germany, the largest Russian trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest of 11 months of record 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy, the block, France, PMI, fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as is Italy ' s weakening of steady growth to stagnation.
In addition, Mr. Dobson said that the signs that the growth momentum was mainly an industrial engine, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands.
Industry slowdowns are likely to increase oil in the fire by analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI had grown to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about August's study of the Eurozone business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “Eurzonors obviously find life very hard at present, because the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially those related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the situation in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit the business -- and especially the confidence of consumers -- and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said, "It's more like what the ECB is going to ultimately have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, though we suspect it's going to be limited."
The people of Mariapola will set up a living chain against the militia
In Mariapolis, until last week, it was all quiet -- no one fought to organize the Mariapol People's Republic, a city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
The residents are now looking forward with horror to the arrival of the "surpassers".
According to political experts, the separatists were breaking up to Mariapola to go to the Azov Sea, recently taking the city of Novozazsk, which had not yet been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariapolians decided that the Ukrainian army would, at least, protect them, but that it had a little force against the well-armed representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and were going to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and strengthenings.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and they stood in a living chain, cutting up the femin of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same if they're coming.
The volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect medicines, and print newspapers.
In the city shops are gradually closed, banks and bankers shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible occupation of school like the children who have been in it are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Czech fighters at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test that struck the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the school atrocities.
About ten years after the terrible occupation of a school of profanity, 334 people, including 186 children, were killed by heroic survivors of the disaster last night on the news of the new Apolypsis in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, this seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West into a state of disgust, which, in a surprising way, turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had lied to death during school atrocities.
We have found wonderful young people who have fought the scourge, even though the remembrance of the terrorist hell will live forever with them.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now terrorizes Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl who's trying to get back into the shelling gym in the photo
She was captured in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belakov, when she tried to go back to a shelled gym after a mine broke out in one case.
Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There was a fear that both of them had died, but they had actually survived.
"The woman told me to get out of here, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier took her and took her to a safe place.
After the surgery, she thought she was completely recovering, but last night she said, "three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
I've got a few fragments left in my knee.
Its goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change this fact.
I always go to this gym once a year to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my schoolmate, Jar Hapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we were dreaming we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the capture remains with her, although memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world will still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from Britain and away.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I'm going out in the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make it happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail pulse thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the country begins school at seven years of age) and survived three days of capture by huging its mother, Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down and hold her by the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, "Beggy."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through the hail bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Dymir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was free to go to hospital with his feet injured, thinking in turn that her son had been killed.
After their reunification, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of children from the Barnardo Foundation's Prime Tony Blair and his wife, Sherry.
"This horror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that I remember him babbling around.
I remember immediately after that I threw all my toy guns away.
But now I can play shooting computer games, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym room, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and go to a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the mountain that he and his friends have experienced.
It's a nightmare coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those suffering from these horrors," said Damir, who had been engaged in volunteer work in a woman's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police office sometime and hope that I will be enrolled at the Academy of Training next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence just after being captured, there were no children crying and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She'll remember her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood that while people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, they can help us.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for that award and to be able to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I would like to call Sherry and just to tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a beard, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Darmir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's been a month after our nightmare, then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world isn't better than this 10 years ago.
There is now a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many people war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Domir grew up and became a very mild and calm boy; he's not aggressive at all, not angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six students, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he was suffering from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember when he threw all his weapons and other military toys, Damir is now 17, he's above me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around me, and I saw some of them lying all over the place.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in that hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Dymir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and escaped.
Thus life for us continues, unlike for so many.
Georgie Ilyn, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became the determining factor for a tragedy in Beslan
Silence: A survivor, George Ilin, and his mother, Fatima, after capture in 2004, and George's case today
His bloody face was a sign of fear when he escaped death when Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of his studies before taking his older son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days a nightmare," she remembered.
Not at all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this day, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Inspiring into the soul, the photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanting to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just learned he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's a sculpture of George's weeping in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's hidden in the book closet at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photograph makes people around the world feel pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that it never happen again.
"I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never learn the truth.
They are now investigating the destruction of Boinga in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what it was called?
This world is going to go to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it's happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war because it's happening?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to go through decades to forget her a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years, I had nightmares because I was so excited, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym in front of every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
I have a hard time entering the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated this year from school and went to the medical university in Vladikakova.
I'll learn to become a cardiosurgery.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
George Farneyv, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farnyev was at the feet of a killer terrorist while captured, but he survived.
At the moment of capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a killer terrorist's leg bomb.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgie, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but couldn't because of the damage his health had suffered during his capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, that I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year, I was the first and last time I entered this gymnasium again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgy Farnyev with a laptop-open photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee, which was damaged, but now I'm good.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to a veterinary institution.
I've been studying there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know Georgie won't go.
It should be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He stays with us.
Georgie's grown up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unjust happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's got several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say he's 50 percent out of this nightmare, but it's not possible to get completely out of the way and forget it.
That terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, which only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart blew out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it difficult to believe it.
We've been one friendly country in the past, as it turns out we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as you can.
Alona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A young man who's been taken to a safe place by a special force.
Saved: Alonu Tskaev is placed in a safe place by the Russian military (left).
She's ten now, and she's not aware of a terrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alain was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists let her go, but they cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christina's ten-year-old sister, and Mahara's brother at the school gymnasium.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenina’s mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, had remarried since then, and they had with his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter whom he named Cristina in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alana, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and grew up in a smart and lifeless girl, says neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahhar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Roslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary comes.
You can understand why.
The colonizer of Sinzi Kagawa, who came back from Manchester United to Dortmund, Belarus, said that he looked forward to being able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that the transfer was a happy event in a career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for "Bruce" again, bringing the Bill of Cagawa's words.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotion, and I look forward to being able to return to the field in the form of "Brorse."
Recall that Kagava moved to the MU from Belarus in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was still unable to stay in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in England's championship, killing six balls and giving eight test gears in two seasons.
The man is charged with driving a girl on the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be tried on a three-year-old train for a three-year-old girl on a Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stuart allegedly shot a girl at Pittenwin's crossing to East Newke.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had led his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and had beaten the girl, which resulted in her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstrester, denied his guilt in Dundy's sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, designated a date for a court in January.
Obama, Merkel, and Olland will not be in Vladivostok
The free - duty shop of Vladivostok State Airport sent a tablet prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders at the store.
And they shall not be denied by the Spirit, by the water, and by the horse.
The shop administration decided that the U.S. President Barack Obama, chancellor Angel Merkel, President François Olland of France, Vitaly Clichko, Yulia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent associates would not be able to cook water, horses and spirits in their store.
And she hung the relevant tablet on the door.
Obama had previously received a ban on his becoming even less accessible by way of service - the MoMA Conventional Capitals, as reported by the General Service Web site.
Whether the U.S. president of the dream ever had to eat in the diet dining room in Russia is not known, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly feel terrible.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitriy Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, new technologies should be used by Russian Aryans in order to obtain the production of crude varieties demanded from buyers.
The Board was provided during a visit to the SouthPepitals Company, Agrocomplex.
The head of Government also advised the restoraries to reoriented to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
Valentin Maslakov, the chief trainer of the Russian-assembly-contributor, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation Tour.
The third is said to be a good result, given the lack of targeted competition preparations.
Our athletes spoke at their level, bringing together the word Maslakov.
The third place is the confirmation of our fairly high command level.
It's nice to see that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we did not prepare for this competition.
The season was complete, and we did not commit our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second in this tournament, but this season we've been renovated.
The French, on the contrary, set out a capable team of 13 champions of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, something they have publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the masters of the race was unable to resist the Americans.
I believe, therefore, that the Russians made such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were lower than those in the same Brillian League.
The season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important, especially in command competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And the result, I agree, was absurd when, at 1,500 meters, men were so involved in the tactics of running, showing the results below the average... of women's escapes.
4 clues, how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video under the water, there are a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight “battle”, for example, Nikon Collpix AW120, or an action panel, for example, GoPro Hero3+Silver Edit, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a few photos, all at about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are several rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure your battery and other compartments are closed.
Besides, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to film.
Some photos and cameras have survey modes or types of site that optimize the exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, see how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off some personnel because many of them won't.
There's CPDs that will help you make pictures, whereas the Action Room usually doesn't have them.
Even if you've got a JCD, it's gonna be hard to look under the water, and the frame layout is going to be a random process.
So do some personnel.
Also, if your camera has a serial survey mode that removes a few personnel with slightly different exposures, use it.
Stay in the surface.
The amount of light falls significantly below the depth of the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off the pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more colour in photographs; the deeper you leave, the less you will see.
Come closer to your survey sites.
It's a great land survey board, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you take off the machine: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-scale lens, which means you're going to have to get closer to the survey sites if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Games Bronze Reserve for the Free Fight of Bilil Mahov can move into the Greco-Rom struggle.
The chief trainer for the Daguestan war effort, Sajid Sajidov, reported this.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of an athlete in the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilil Mahov is on the team of the classics, bringing in the words of Said Sajidov, the R-Sport.
In fact, Bellal did both things in style.
On the youth front of the world in 2005, he became a winner of the Volts' tournament and a third prize in the Grenko-Malian competition and decided to concentrate on the free struggle.
It's been a long time when we talked about a new phase of our career, and we're going to be in the Greco-Rom struggle.
I'm going to say more: Mahov can be on the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the adventure.
But a decisive word always comes from a train headquarters headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lowson was a man whose powers of person could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The anesthesiologist, who advises the anesthesiologist, dedicated his career to the recovery of patients from both the suffering of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who treated him, his wife remembered him, was an MI-6 who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Looson realized that while doctors were involved in diagnosis and disease, those who received treatment were primarily concerned about something else -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the first to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
I found it difficult to find strength in myself.
Faced with flulike symptoms, he found that his wife, Juliet, was irritated.
"I want things to go faster than later," he said.
When Juliette went out on business for a week, Looson found that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked the colleague to do an X-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier he had been on the skis in the French Alps.
The X-rays are here.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plume, or a lung shell.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact reason.
Although some smokers suffer from lung cancer, for example, not all those with lung cancer have smoked.
But it's different with mesothetics.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle”, but which is now known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbist, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a recommendation industrial ban came into force.
Even when used, only people from specific industries worked closely with him, such as tube insulatingrs, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is on the top of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here more people die of mesothem than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die of the disease as a result of road accidents.
Annual number of mesothemotomy deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma is usually taken decades to develop.
And mesothelioma is not limited to veterans in industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in the home where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of wealth, the profession or the age.
The Bastons of election, from fashionable London colleges to private schools, proved to be no salvation.
The House of Parliament has been swept by asses.
Even the hospitals, which are designed to treat us, have become reservoirs of this deadly recital.
Andrew Lowson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulating.
In fact, he had to think where he could get in touch with the asbestos.
Then he designed it.
"It seems that there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnel at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and trucks used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“One of the four doctors who had been interned at Guy's hospital and who had subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years”, he noted in a letter in 2010, “I'm the only one left alive”.
How many of us get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lowson was diagnosed with mesothemomy when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on 17 February, he was 55.
It's not unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of people with mesothelioma die eight months after diagnosing.
She's always deadly.
So now we can just say, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the leading expert on mesothem in Britain, the most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain has to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them do not know that they are going to die in this way.

A quick review of reports from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far a mesothelioma has spread.
In this June, for example, Marks & Spenner admitted that he had been exposed to harassment by Janice Ellen in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the dress offices at two facilities, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she says, "I never heard of mesothelim, I barely knew about the asbestos.
I couldn't have come to my head to see it get me involved.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, it's a group of six minerals.
They were named from the word “asbestoform”, which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of those six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is more common in buildings to date.
It was used in the blood cells, the used tile, thermosolution of pipes, cokes, even in brake vehicle wells.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as “a serious source of health damage”, which can lead to death.
It is more dangerous, however, to have brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (roquidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are strong, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of the extremely high number of people with mesothemomy [in Great Britain]”.
Marks & Spenner was exposed to asbestos in the company’s main store at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “the significant percentage of mesothel when there is no known impact on work or home was probably due to the environmental impact of asbestos”.
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the “normal use and effects of the weather” on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which addressed the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the heart of the Government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be moved into something as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in that case it seems right to the contrary.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Guide insisted that the Westminster Palace received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that work should be done on ?1 billion to rebuild Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be sitting at the QE2 conference centre nearby rather than at the Westminster Green Rocks.
Goddard's report noted that “assessing was not managed according to different rules”.
It's impossible to know if this control error is worth living.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have not been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbot, a general doctor.
Like Andrew Lowson, Abbot, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I've been working in a hospital that has been successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the jobs and dates.
That he remembers clearly, that's the day early in December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I began to feel bad.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abott knew that the pain was coming from the shoulder, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect meotheli.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Intelligent doctors have taken X - ray images of the chest and placed recorders to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it to the test.
Yet, his condition was left unagnosed.
His health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the same symptoms came back, often after he had been a sport and had been a heavy smoker.
In 2011, an Abott patient came to his hospital with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed as a mesothelioma.
But even then, Abott did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Ebott’s condition deteriorated again, and his consultant showed the results of the CT and X-ray images to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Ebott began feeling bad, the camera - equipped sensor was placed in a lane between his chest shell and his light shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I didn't worry too much about that, frankly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
Biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year, "I told you it was mesothetomy."
Graham Ebbott, diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbot got caught up in a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermosolination on pipes was quite common," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now struck by more young people in non-standard occupations.
The most dangerously isolated asses piped in hospitals were in the basement, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many staff members who went through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lowson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Ebbett often did) were almost likely exposed to toxic substances.
Within a few decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, life was saved for patients, but a place that posed a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Schoolmates set up Bunsen's burners on asbestos fronts.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of his amazing isolation and fire-fighting characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, for the first time, many were likely exposed to asbestos in class.
Throughout the country, at countless chemistry classes, schoolboys set up their Bunsen burners on asbestos fronts.
Websites focusing on asbestos in schools have come into play.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as the nasal plate or the roof of the locusts were usually kept by asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison placed in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lowson in a case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman might recall was the demolition of a garden sari in the 1970s.
So be careful, have a garden shed.
The diagnosis effect, when we know that the disease is incurable, is a threat.
"It takes a lot of time to realize this," says Graham Ebbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was a shift from a doctor’s position to a patient’s position.
Like an uncalculated number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to take.
"It's been hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanics of life that we support, the act of breathing itself, that causes the cancer that kills.
Most mesotheliomas are related to asbestos.
Asbest consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and fibers inhaled, they may be stuck in the shoulder, the shell of the lungs.
Asbesto’s fiber is exasperating the pyre and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises because of the inhaling of the asbestos fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiootoctal surgeon who came to Guyana Hospital in 2001.
It was that hospital, where Andrew Lowson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment centre.
The trainer knew Lowson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed by interning in the hospital.
When asbestos' needles fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "by breathing them, they're pushed to the area where the shell is located.
It's actually an invasive process from the outset.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical interventions, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some feel like it's worth a try.
Coach doesn't agree.
"It's not possible to cut off the shoulder," he says.
It's impossible to come up around her with a knife.
However, this cancer is not very good at chemotherapy, which “acts” but does not cure.
"From time to time there are sick people who live long," Treger says.
But eventually, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Ebott continues to fight.
After he became sick with mesothelioma, Abott was introduced to Andrew Lowson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Rak Central," he said lifelessly when they called.
"He was very positive," Abbot says.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very vigorous.
At first, Ebott proposed six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Looson, however, "was careful to make the painting more positive."
Upon meeting several specialists, Abbot decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdounski, a professor of thorax surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admitted Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothetic patients to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally imminently ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lowson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was clear that even very small quantities could put health risks at risk.
It was then that the company’s bad faith was discussed.
Andrew Lowson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a “full-cost settlement”, according to Morgana, because Looson was unable to prove unequivocally that his mesothemo was the result of contact with asbestos in Gaia hospital.
Following an investigation into his death, a representative of the Guy Hospital nevertheless confirmed that “Asbest in the basements referred to in the 1990s was removed”.
It was too late for Andrew Lowson.
Removing asbestos
In fact, it was a major problem for people with mesophylique who needed compensation to contact one company or place of work, usually decades later.
Many of their former employers have replaced or closed the owner.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that on their side there is no time for the plaintiffs, of course.
In response, serious new legislation has been adopted this year, which facilitates the recovery of compensation to patients with mesothem, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under this Act, a CLD350 million-million-dollar fund was established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who are not treated.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, around ?120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesothetic patients, believes that the 350 million are "very good work" for the insurance industry.
"It's a transaction written by insurers for insurers," he says, saying that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if there were no interference with the time limit and people with mesotheli could track the companies and file their claims on a regular basis.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law had been passed.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothemo last December.
By that time, Professor Loika Lange-Lazdzunski had been in the hands of Graham Ebbott for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lange-Lazdounski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, is considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy that could boast about 40 per cent of survivors in five years.
Abbot felt the strength.
"It's of course one of the most important things," Abbot says.
You see that from patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Ebott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
The subsequent scans also showed no signs of illness.
I was then scanned in March [2014].
There was a few stains in my chest.
I was just about 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And once again, Abbot went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- about finance, when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how a timer works on a fighter.
When you get bad news, it becomes a mess.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temzin's 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It was hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I won't live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
It's very common and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more self-reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for people with mesotypes, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even with the opportunity to survive.
This disease is occurring with itself (even how, after all, Stephen Jay Gould has a grim certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, “the mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.
The bodies of herded pharaohs are turned into asbestos cloths.
The asbestos fibre is used to strengthen the pan and heat resistance.
The Old Man describes asbestos.
Now we have a canvas that's not going to be inflamed.
I've seen what's done out of him, salfies, cracking in rocks on banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos starts in Italy, where it is used for paper (also for banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's an ideal heat-restrict device for steam engines and a turbine of the Industrial Revolution.
World asbestos production is increasing to over 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statistics reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who, as a result, are denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook shows that the asbestos particles in her lungs "are, of course, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this type.
The employers of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of asbestos, was developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for harm to health caused by access to asbestos in the United Kingdom.
World asbestos production increases to over 423,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The UK Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All the use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothem Act was passed in Britain.
The compensation scheme in the amount of £350 million has been announced.
Asbesto is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; the protestors swear against
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This is likely to start long-awaited protests in Hong Kong ' s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing at an hour after the application.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress, in effect, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it does make us angry," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the leader of Hong Kong to stand for election would be too “haothetical”.
Since 1997, when Britain passed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to choose by vote a head of Government beginning in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward because it gives the Hong Kongs the right to direct ballot; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands by means of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was reached after the summer, when some of the most extensive and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central Movement ("Low and Peace"), whose organizers threatened to close Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday night, just hours after the application, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong Government's headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers stated that their movement went to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, evidently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and no other choice had been made.
We regret to say that, to date, all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
The State authorities in Hong Kong had prepared for Beijing a few days and security measures involving the police and barricade had been strengthened on Sunday at the Government headquarters.
The violence is at the root of the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of residents from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are becoming weaker under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize Occupy Central, saying that his demonstrations put him at risk of business, a source of life in Hong Kong.
"The protest they talk about can lead to great economic damage, depending on how much person will participate and how long," said the legislator, Regina Eep, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be concerned that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
The Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, in which the Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists have been shown to be Diversists sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of the voters of Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American university students have been invited to visit a private plane by means of American ball culture.
We're happy to respond to this demand by launching the first "lux" travel in the UK for the current students.
To leave a strong impression on the arrival of a university, the company also offers options such as a private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to drive their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new versions for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to reach university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that since the service had just been launched, the orders had not yet been delivered, but added that “studies would start ordering this service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the fact that the students needed to pay for their schooling in the year, it still hoped to find a market for that service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as being devoid of reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NSS of Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly disentangled from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month are faced with a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to achieve the fast-growing cost of basic needs before they can even begin thinking about putting thousands of pounds into something like a simple arrival in a dormitories.
Feminists raise the question of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
A unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The attackers raise their hands by shouting, "Do not shoot up," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of the unarmed teenage Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed a shift in Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists, who left their comments, placed the gender above race when it came to advancing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Perez saw responses from white women who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the response of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, a personal essay with headlines such as “Ferguson's thinking on the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But to Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminium, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about the white color of the skin and the privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt they needed to say something about what had happened.
It was very symbolic of the crisis we faced, and because (the Ferguson situation) was so racially related, they felt it was necessary to point it out.
For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Korea, Mitchell Ferguson highlighted the problems black Americans face every day but not perceived as “women's problems” in cultural matters.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner and I'll get 150 sticks from all over the place," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how color people are being attacked in their own country, silence dries up.
"Why are women safe to talk publicly about relations, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to share these problems clearly; they faced a difficult reality every day.
While white women now combine the issues of race and gender at the Feminist Mainström, Angela Hättery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, said that their predecessors did the opposite.
“There were at least 10,000 black men in 1865 and 1890, and this was almost always the case with the rape of a white woman,” he told him.
I needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From the point of view of Hetter, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffrists, for example Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all eggs in a basket of voice for women, and the black voices were to appear later," said Hetery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why colorful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had obtained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against linchets at the Association of South Women for the Prevention of Linviv.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised in Ferguson, the behaviour of the police and racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to “go” the problems that black women faced in several generations.
"Yes, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology were to take the right to raise a child as they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second wave, who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
The famous white activist of the feminist movement Gloria Stoyem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by the Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans be more involved in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and the view of racial problems - which are significantly different in public surveys - will be the head of the change," wrote Stanem.
Although Stene is handcuffed over by more overlapping feministism, which includes issues of race, and the gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Business Christina Sommers, author of "who stole feminism?" said She The Pople, that young men in the United States, especially the colorful young people, “are more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Stayem's labels about Ferguson run counter to the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small programme, "The Guard of My Brother" to help vulnerable black and Latino - speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem moving forward with traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escorting them to the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform again came to the surface, the same time as the problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that is mobilizing women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present this problem as important to women, she just needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [men immigrants], women who come with them are placed in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories come with feedback from women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich house is sold
A picture of a house put on sale in Safolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig in a hotel.
The one-to-sale house is standing on the private road in Ipsvich.
A detailed description was the picture of the living room, where a pig with its head on the couch was depicted.
The Real Estate Agency Connelles reported that the pig in the photo was the homeowner's pet.
“One day, the photo was placed on error and was already removed”, the representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connels described the former meeting house as "an unique separate house with one bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of the house was of interest in social networks, where some people asked whether pigs were sold together.
Russian tennisr Maria Sharpaova, in U.S.A. ' s fourth, U.S. Open match, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish her year and try to get to the new level, passing Vassili OSIPS from New York.
How do you generally appreciate your results on the Big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I succeeded in winning "Rolan Garros."
With regard to the three other tours, I did not enjoy stability, especially in the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
After all, I couldn't even get to a quarter of a bear.
What are your goals before the end of the season?
After I'm hurt, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to do, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian prison series begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former World Cup, Nicolai Valuev, proposed that the GTWT grant pay compensation when entering higher education.
He said that, in general, the norm would be the same as in Soviet times, that people would make standards in the way of stretching, running, and other exercises.
Recall that 12 Russia's constituents will start implementing the GTO standards on their territory from 1 September.
I also offered to schoolgirls who had given up the GTO to give a bonus on entry to higher education, notes Valuve.
For example, they might be able to add points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional exit services for enterprises that have undergone these sports tests.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire emerged after winning a lottery game
A player in the Harvey lottery this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where a lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million with a lottery toy on Saturday night.
The Harwi newspaper stand for gold at the peak in the second five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement about himself.
Steve Forward, the owner of the laurel, said that the win-win had caused the muzzle in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about this, and everything is very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight Western Australian winners were late last month for winning the main prize, noting the completion of several good weeks for State players.
Last week a Kenning Weil player became one of five million people on August, following a huge $7.5 million winning couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and had told them that the winner had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.

Minoconomy wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, Miniconomy will introduce to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally sound transport in Russia, and briefed the director of the Department of Public Service at the round table held at the Moscow Autosalon 2014.
The plan is commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September and early October, said the Pluniks, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids, the plan for the development of gas-fueled vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy has Knowledge) is 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; the concession credit scheme and concessional lising will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, promote localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is proposed to amend the regulations in order to facilitate the construction of the charge infrastructure (in parks, railway stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for the regional authorities to encourage the use of environmentally sound transport, in the form of advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, and proposals to increase the public procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development will add to the list by October 2014 criteria for assessing regional authorities ' performance, reflecting the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport, the development of charge infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia has yet to be formed - about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on the electric vehicles was charged, so sales would be about 500 pieces, predicting the chief executive director of the Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But the fivefold increase does not make electric cars visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
So far, only the Mitsubishi Motors import electric cars into Russia.
Renault is preparing imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Renault, the director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiss.
Most other electric transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has Russian producers, "", "GAZ", "but the output is mythical.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to data from ASM-Holding, AVAS released 30 electric cars.
The demand is short because of the value of the electric car, and the director of AvtoWAZ for the engineering of Sergey Amánov, without the ring of break in this segment....
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles other than the expensive machinery (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice the value of the analogies to internal combustion engines) inhibits the inaccuracies of the charge infrastructure (fuels - units), sighs the genitor "Avtostata" by the Serge of the Goals.
Because of the road and the low rate of cost reduction, the electric vehicle will remain the lowest segment of the Russian market in the next 3 to 4 years, predicts the editor-in-chief of the Airway, Mikhail Perezansky, and agrees with it.
On the contrary, auto-producers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of ordinary vehicles.
In the Russian market for electric vehicles, the main thing is to build confidence in consumers that “electronicity” is real; this will, inter alia, contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlim.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, are being implemented by the Government of Rossetti, and several stations have been built in Moscow, and some 80 more will soon emerge.
Negotiations for the construction of a lawn network are ongoing with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Rossety, Vladimir Sofjein, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gasses all over the country, but there are challenges: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands of electric vehicles.
In addition, Rosetti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and it is being developed to do so with regard to the charge of electric vehicles.
Pankov is considered to be the most effective measure of the development of the market for electric vehicles in Russia to impose customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and extending the concessional list will be developed.
The replacement of the transport tax on environmental (the idea discussed and applied to all machines) would also support the market, but not as significant as customs preferences, considered Pankov to be.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have resulted in a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles - they now account for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for motorists, such as free parking at the center of the city (as they have already done in Moscow), confident of Pankov, or the possibility of the movement of electric vehicles across the strips, which is not yet available in Russia.

He has gone on a cheap journey, and he has even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now in advance playing a deterioration in the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions for Russia.
In the meantime, though, it is more like an artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially the Western.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the Russian Federation are not so much.
TeleTrade “The opening of the Moscow exchange of rubles continues to be severely weakened against the parent basket.

Twitter has tried to become more interesting to new users
Twitter has changed the user registration process to engage new actors more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have dropped their microbloges.
New Twitter users will now look at a large number of service account recommendations at the time of registration in order to obtain their first reading.
Recommendations are made on the basis of registered interests.
With this in mind, Twitter automatically places a check on the signature for all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user will have to hand-cuff the tie so he won't read those he doesn't care about.
If the microblog services users have previously seen only avatars of recommended users, Twitter now produces a model of a popular blogger Twitter to help create an impression of a human being.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration country over the past three years.
Twitter has recently been working actively to modernize the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve immortality.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of user base and the decline in reader activity.
The company now desperately needs more loyal consumer resources, which would remain for a long time.
Only in this way can a steady flow of advertising be achieved.

Since 1 September, a car disposal programme has been reactivated in Russia.
Ten billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose by 31 December 2014.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Mantourov, explained, money is derived from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will involve all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 per passenger vehicle to 350,000 roubles per cargo.
Earlier in Russia, a similar car disposal programme had been in operation.
The main difference in the current project was that it was not only planned to dispose of the machine for the subsequent discount but also the possibility, if the vehicle had reached the age of more than six years, of acquiring a new discount while giving the old man a third-in from the dealer, was passed on to Interfax.
Over 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which was in operation from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent as compared to 2009).
The creator of the Coming Out Simulator will release the game of modern journalism
The Heimdian Nicky Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game of modern journalism.
He described his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Caseys started playing a game a few weeks ago, but it's only now that this fact is widely known.
The events in Ferguson were a source of inspiration, where protests began following the murder of a unarmed black youth.
In the focus of the project, which has no name yet, there will be how the coverage of stories affects their effects.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero may take a different picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protestors are thugs, the police will be better off treating him and letting him go where the ordinary man can't go.
If he did not, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
Points in the game will need to be picked with a Twitter hero in which new subscribers will appear if the photos produced there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how a photograph of it was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept for a long time, but he initially wanted to devote it to the events in the United States, rather than to protests in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, he was aware that he lacked the knowledge and skills to tell the history of the region.
But when he saw media coverage of Ferguson’s events, he decided to play on the basis of what had happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who issues selected games.
The most well-known project was the Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which discusses events in the biology of Casea itself, is about how a bisexual youth tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Helicopter is pulling Ukraine into the continuation of the bloodshed
The Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valerius Gheletey, is called for to prepare for another “ten thousand” victims in an appeal for the continuation of the bloodthirsty, is referred to in a report by the FIED.
“In Moscow, of course, reference was made to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department of Valeria Gheletia, who declared that “the operation to release the Eastern Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the Great National War, which will have resulted in the loss of tens of thousands.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the said post on his Facebook page, is the subject of a study of specialists in a non-military field,” states a communication from Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its Facebook page, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us”.
He stated, however, that “an operation for the release of the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized
Today it is a horror that has overwhelmed more than 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud in smartphones, and their intimate images appeared on the blog site of Perez Hilton.

Stuart got his stupid car to the garage and then walked out without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 team members were upset, but now he's going to focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after the collision with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope to come to finish well," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded with an evacuator, and the team came together and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup race after his car was shot down and killed by another driver during the groundwater race in the north of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to take part in the persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident, which resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on a traspert to express his grievances to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue at least two more weeks.

Scob and Witten have cigarettes with Zzhanzka in Odessa.
Xenia Sobczak and Max Whitten are now in Odessa, something that television broadcasters have not forgotten to report in their Instalgram.
True, one picture was very surprised and very sad for the couple who were worshipers.
The film is taken in Zhaninski.
"On a breakfast with Mikhail Mikhalchak, Janek Maxima explains what the article is:) () #Oodess," signed a photograph by Xia Sobczak.
But besides cigarettes, there's nothing on the table.
No coffee, no bunny, no butter, no more...
The couple decided that Ksenish was smoking too, and they condemned her for doing so.
"And whose cigarettes?," "Knows kills!" "Which one is a cigarette breakfast," "It would look like a breakfast, and only cigarettes on the table) "", "Kenya, do you smoke too?" -- excitedly for their favorite subscriber's blogs.
Remember, it was not long ago that Sobczak boasted of what a delicious meal he had prepared for the first time in his life, Maxim Whitorgan.
"Happily, when you arrive at your meal, your husband has prepared dinner for your visit," he boasted to his husband, Xinja Sobczak.
You can see in the picture that Maxim is making something hard, and there's a little salty on the table and a baked chicken on the table.

The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praute (right) appointed Lawyt Vongswana (left) Minister of Defence
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prait Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, where more than one third of the posts of Generals or Generals are retired.
The army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praju Chan-Ocha was officially approved as Prime Minister following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of a head of the interim military Government for that office.
The 60-year-old military, who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup of 22 May, was the only candidate for the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Prajua Chan-Ochah, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which the protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yingla Chinawat.
The formal Praute Chang-Ocha will be a temporary Prime Minister, as the military plan to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of the total paralysis of civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they arrested the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is at the root of 2006 when the army removed Brother Yinglak Chinvat Taciin from its post as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has been a success in the elections.
However, many middle class and capital elites entered the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 had almost paralyzed the country.
Nobody told me the copper salad would be better, I didn't promise you, and I was kidding a waitress from the new Palm braser.
It is necessary to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and the stomach remain steadfast.
Because we all know for a long time that we're saying "Belgium," we're referring to mussels, we're saying mussels, we're saying "Belgium."
Restors like to say in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: the location, the location and again the location.
There are places that are not in order to be good, not even fine, but some sort of unwitting.
Anyway, while I was sitting at the Palm table, I remember that there was a Gondok cafe here once, and then Odessa Mom, and also the Bojole restaurant, and the Duzba beer.
Now it's a beer again, but it's not Belgian anymore.
Above the ground was only the tip of the iceberg — the bar stand and the pair of tables — the rest of the space had nothing to do with the sun.
But here's a lot of fun, like in a baby room: red, yellow, and green walls, and all kinds of color walls, instead of windows, televisions, where the girls of Crusal are swimming.
Belgium's institutions in Petersburg are not in the news anymore, so it's like eating something.
There are eight species of spilling beer (260,300 roubles per 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The model waitress for the waitress to present the menu cheerfully, saying that "medis are big seeds," and to be noted, it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that's the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected to be content, but often very unexpected.
Who, for example, is given to predict that a meat roll with a Walloon ink (280 roubles) is, in fact, a carpacho cut in as thin as it is so thin that the parchment paper will show up to the matter as opposed to it.
It's only possible to get any taste if you put half-creatures together.
It's worse with the salads.
Classical Lage (260) is the best thing to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some crazy iceberg, a stuffed old-timed card that has scattered the Kenyan Fascule, a superveloined beacon, plus some marina bow.
You don't want to meet anyone with that lega salad!
The composition of the Belgian salad ingredient was partly different, but the impression was not different.
If a quarter of the cakes or overcooked champagne could still be closed, why would they look like they've been able to unfrozen and warm up several times in their lives?
After all, I already know that there are some perfectly normal white - sea mussels!
They are served in a “saults of your choice” (490,560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The man who was made of white wine, Selderium, and carrots was not agnostic.
There is food and there is no aroma, and whether or not wine was there, it is still a mystery.
But the mid - mid - mid - midway fries with the Mayone's home are good.
The chicken waterline here is not a hustle, thick to such a degree that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice plumber.
It was said that the rabbit was a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the Lobster.
On the surface, the situation turned out to be the opposite in a sense, with razzarin suffocating.
It seemed as if this rabbit had been fed exclusively with rose-intestinal bushes in its life, and the meat had acquired such an indiscretion.
But at the same time, the rabbit was attached to the knife -- no, no, just a big pea in the caramelized short.
The Palm waffles offer not only sweet but also raw ones with beef, chicken or bouracon and cheese (220-280).
The celery sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager at the table was very informal in his interest.
So it's worth coming back.
The dollar was raised on the MBI above 37 roubles on news of Western-prepared new sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar of tomorrow's 10.29 ml of rose by 26.02 roubles, rose by 30 copiers to 48.73 roubles, reports the Moscow Exchange.
The animal basket grew by 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
The dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009 before the Crimean events, and on 3 March 2014 it was 37,005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that President Barack Obama of the United States and Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
Detention of rubles is long-term, and in couples with euros, and in couples with a dollar.
The long-term forecast was based on this mark, says Anna Bodrov, senior analyst of the Alpari.
Everything connected to Ukraine will be reflected in courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
There are no rumours of military incursions today, but the market is very emotional.
All the talk about him being persistent about such news was re-listed yesterday.
A week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period ended, oil prices were weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine, all in one chain.
Inflation is also projected: between 5 per cent and 10 per cent will be added to current autumn prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be finished soon and a vacuum will come in as networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
“Dollar came to the mark in 37 roubles, passed it and returned back, no powerful tantrum,” comments the head of the Market Analysis Division, “The Opening of Broker”, Constantine Bushev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on the Saturday, as NATO will meet.
He said that he was greatly weakened after the tax season and then went to Ukraine to give news, adding that the CB last week said that by the end of the year, he was completely moving to a floating course and abandoning any exchange-rate intervention.
If you look at the day’s knee, it's nothing different than the previous one during this month, everyone is afraid of that mark in 37 roubles, and it's still an analyst.
Yeah, well, there's nothing powerful happened in terms of turnover.
At an alarming time for the foreign exchange market, I will recall when the demand for currencies increased at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS I sees a positive side to reduced rouble.
First of all, it is an increase in the revenue of the export budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through a value-added of imports, says UFS general analyst Alexei Kozlov.
Negative aspects include the travel of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, led to increased inflationary pressures and, as a result, increased borrowing, which in turn impedes the development of the country ' s economy.
On the equity market, the depreciation of roubles has slightly reduced the price of shares expressed in roubles.
For example, the MBI index for the Thursday trade fell by 1.67 per cent, and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
A significant difference in the relative decrease in indices is attributable to the lowering of rouble over the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of rubies is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy money.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go wrong, and the burning of rubles partially or completely restores lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic breach is often misdiagnosed
Briton reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after the wrong diagnosis.
Caryin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she was only a few years old after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a disease called Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SHT) -- a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerve outside her brain and her spine.
CMT UK reported that the misdiagnosed diagnosis was a frequent problem among people with CMM because it was so little to know about that condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have a CMM, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unconvinced walking and acquiescence to the legs.
The sick may feel a sense of immunity or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from an attack by Friedreh (AF) -- a situation for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought that she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, 51 now, said, "I knew, baby, I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for it.
I've never been able to ride on pegs or skateboards with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because of how I was going and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to free the slopes of her tendon and turn the feet, she looked on the medical map when her doctor got out of the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I fell off my nose, which is why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked to find the most terrible panic I could.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair in 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she was able to find CMM.
"When he explained what the CHT was, I thought I was taking out a happy ticket," she said.
Britain's Charming Organization has announced a month's information about the United Kingdom of Great Britain in an effort to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington Area is rising as the economy is restored
A rising economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased steadily last year when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the Washington Area company was not an exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid a total of $27.6 billion in the state and local treasury in 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business at the state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, a third consecutive year of growth after falling in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent according to a study carried out by a professional firm, Ernst & Youngg and State Tax Centre, tax policy unit.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, is due to business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland ' s tax revenue is from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the lowest tax revenue, proportional to entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenue increases were due to a continuing return to the value of company real estate, according to researchers, raising real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the large share of these revenues is in the big states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington zone as well.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia have paid a total of $10 billion in real estate taxes in the state and local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 is an increase of 4.2 per cent compared with the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of company tax accounts.
The Virginia and District companies pay about half of their state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the Colombia District Tax Base, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent rise in business tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs ' incomes also seem to be subject to an adjustment according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income taxes, most of which is in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three places.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the country average, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia experienced a rise in tax revenues below average income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (of which the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs at both the state and local levels and, in general, a more favourable climate for business tax than for Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, just as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to achieve its tax objectives next year, the law could lead to the rate of income tax for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small business in the Washington zone seems to feel better and thus pay more taxes in the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid in the form of individual income taxes paid by owners of small businesses -- a transitional structure in which most of the small firms -- in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, much more rapidly than those for the enterprise as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with a volume tax in the state and local governments, rising by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period of last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be left behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Dudo
The World Cup championship on the judo brought together two silver and seven bronze awards from Russia.
According to this indicator, the Russians were left only by Japan’s chief country of competition.
The coach in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day he brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan Mudran, who was in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the final fight against Baldbaatar Ghanbat of Mongolia, the argument was based on a single observation received by a Russianman.
And on the second day, the tournament was the most successful for the Russian assembly -- three medals were captured on Tuesday.
In male competitions, up to 66 kg silver silver was obtained by Mikhail Pulaev and the bronze by Kamal Khan-Magomeova.
In the final roll, the Russians gave up the peace championship for 2011 and 2013 to Japanese Masasi Ebinum.
Han-Magodov, who lost a compatriot at the fourth stage, was successful at a coveted tour and became the holder of a bronze prize.
Nataya Kuzutin was also able to win until the third stage of the pedestal.
She lost Maylind Kelmendi from Kosovo in a semi-Final peace championship, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Dudo and successfully defended the title.
In a dispute for a bronze bronze, Ma Inan of China won, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that the third place was not what she was looking for.
Again, the barrier to gold was Kelmendi, who had defeated Kuzutin before in the final stage of the European championship.
On the third day of the Shilabinska tournament, a bronze in a sample of the Russian prefabricated was laid down by Musa Mashkov, who was fighting in the category up to 73 kg.
In a quarterfinit, his former representative, Moldavia Victor Sokortsov, is now in charge of the OAE team.
But then the Russianman won two cases and became the owner of the prize.
The Moscows performed on the home championship with a hotel injury that he planned to heal in the near future, so he would take a pause in the race.
As for Skortsov's ex-moldine, he and he went to the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots who had accepted the OAE sports nationality, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, closed his statement up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of PM-2014 also brought one bronze to the Russians, which was won up to 81 kg by Ivan Nephonts.
He won Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from a rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played, but the Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill of the Quests, and was guaranteed by Russia’s bona fide medal, and was co-companyed by Kirill Denisov.
However, it was not the drawing of the case itself that the questionner was unable to make his way out of his father ' s room because of the trauma.
The man's bronze was won by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed in a collecting copy by the Resta Nut Said, a member of the group over 100 kg.
In a comforting finish, he gained a clean victory over the Brazilian man David Moura.
So came the individual part of the world’s birthright.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, Sunday, champions of the world played the champions' team competitions.
Both Russian prefabricateds - male and female - were among the main candidates for the awards, but, like individual competitions, they were not lucky to have a good sex - they did not reach the medal.
And then Russian judoists won the command silver.
In a decisive battle, they have left the main client of the competition, the Japanese team, in the fight against the 2-3 account.
At the same time, the Russian prefabricated company led between 2 and 0 after the victory of Khan-Magodov and the military - Denis Jartitz (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habachov (81), Maged Mahomed (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
In the same scenario, a bronze match was developed in a women ' s tournament, where a Russian assembly, 2-0 vs., was abandoned by the Japanese from 2-3.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, attended the command competitions in Chelabinsk and congratulated the manic assembly with the Serb.
"The second place is very important, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, quoted by RIA, "The News."
I don't want to lose the Japanese, judo's parents, there's nothing here that's dark.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian national championship on the world's home was much better off than a year ago at the competitions at this level held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansour Isaac.
We're all big perfectionists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle goes into eight of the strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Even more so in the form of sports, such as judo, the Turkish Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation, Vitali Mukot, who is the result of the championship's press service.
Japan’s team is expected to be better in Chellabinska, winning 11 medals of varying dignity, five of which are gold.
The next world championship will take place in the summer of the next year in Astan.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family is hoping for the best
Joan Rivers is unaware of his arrival in New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter was hoping today that an 81-year-old coed actress would recover from the disease.
"Thanks for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in his statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at the clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endospi, report sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of drugs and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripe.
Everyone can get kings.
To sell a debut album of the Royal Woods group is a new hope of the British rock that brought rock-doots out of the clubs by way of a stadium.
Douche Royal Woods has been on stage all year, but has already been active with the mark on the BBC music prize, a tour of the Architic Monkeys, and a visit to the New York concert game from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut is a single album a few months before the relision received 100,000 predictions, and the contract for its release lies in the Mayr-Leblo Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is coming out of a number of countries, because it's not about the new Lane Del Rey or the next sweet voice to represent the new R'n'B, but about a bit of bacilli looking British playing at the level of thunder and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
Generally speaking, the rates for the first album in relation to all of the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully met.
Doutt had taken on a name that he could have learned before, except for the most desperate, hairy metalsmiths, and the blood of which is flowing, as they think, in their veins, is understandable.
This is, of course, first of all about Leed Zeppelin's fellows: like the big quartet, Royal Wood is designed to pull the blood of the British river in the new height.
To predict the success of this enterprise is now likely to be early, but something can be said.
A dozen songs that took place in thirty and a half minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composerry as a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the merit of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: a say, a pilot single, "Out Of The Black", is characteristic of what is mentioned, not by the melodic line, but by the drums.
Musicians say the song is easier to learn than to drink.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful Lottle Monster and the closing plate of the "Better Strangers" composition, with a Tskaspsic quote in the head.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy-year-old party, but they will fall into a more or less homogeneous canvas when they win.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The Royal Woods force is that they don't claim to laurries of the new Lennon and McCarthy (later known as the successors of the Motörhead), but they've removed a lot of rock pieces from the etiquette.
Their music, despite some diversity, was built for stadiums in a room of fewer than a few thousand people, evidently close to her.
The secret is partly in the subtle use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in its usual format, which was invented at the beginning of the zero The White Streets.
But it's not just tools, it's also about singing.
The heroes of the retrocrete of zeros were very hard to get out of the post-modern paradigm, with a huge reluctance to admit themselves, not just by epigons, but by individual creative units.
The Royal Wood is already being developed so powerfully that it is a success in spoiling some secondary and hardy musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
MAZON has just confirmed what Information on Friday morning: Online and video producers, and a hundred other things, buys a flow-of-tach service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
That was a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch sold Google video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justine.tv, set the goal of being a stream service of a general nature -- the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their internal games; YouTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video artist in which all-knowing games are produced (mainly old) like the "Taine Theatre" are already popular on YouTube.
The thing is that YouTube is often referred to as the Twitch, so the news that YouTube is getting to Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company buying a potential competitor.
This is a secret why a YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that he was willing to pay at least Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
It's kind of like me sleeping around saying that they're going to do sports better than watch it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick on their own.
One thing is to look through the other's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and the other is to watch some other person get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Deuty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so to watch them film them, without being in control of the eye on their own, can be a recipe for the headache that is worthy of Do It Right.
I'll agree that the fast way in which Rogers Benynistics of our electronic century complete their game in record time is having fun.
But if it's not about virtualization of the game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting.
But what do you know skeptics like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and that's the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to earn this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will go to Amazon Instant Video as fine as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, the Twitch has something that would have been pleased with any company — a crowd of young men who are wanted by the commercials.
As Head Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch put faith in a future game, and this channel does not give evidence of a imagination, even oh, as a sighted sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were wounded.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages -- almost all students, the parents of the dead, the nurse of the cemetery -- the City of Angels -- Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the Mothers of Beslan, Susan Dudewa, who had participated in the special operation by an MCH officer -- tells Elizabeth Antonov, a correspondent of the Society, who worked on the project.
Upon his return to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Alahanov, who was an adviser to the President on the Northern Caucasus 10 years ago and was engaged in discussions with terrorists, as well as with the Russian FSB officer Vjaceslav Bocarov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this subject was that Beslan had as if it hadn't been in the decade.
It is a very painful subject for all who have anything to do with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
Travel is very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job,' said Anton.
The project was prepared by a study of the idling Rambler & Co, which works in the company since spring of this year.
The previous special projects were devoted to World War I and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK has implemented the launch of a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small-range missile in the Japanese sea, reports the Ryenhap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the North Korean and China border.
It is believed that the rocket fell into the Japanese sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared at the Joint Committee of Southern Korea Chiefs of Staff.
The Deputates proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russians will not be kept on their overseas servers as of 1 January 2015
The State had introduced a draft law that would transpose the date of entry into force of the already adopted Act on Personal Data of Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower Chamber.
It was sponsored by Vice-Chairmen, Goduma Wadim Djong, Yaroslav Nilov (LDC), Eugenius Fedorov (Edin Russia), Vladimir Parakhine (Equitable Russia) and Alexander Yushenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, will help to ensure more prompt and effective implementation of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to maintain their personal data and to keep correspondence in the information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which is made into force by parliamentarians, requires that personal Russian data processed via the Internet be kept on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, clarify and extract the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the Act empowers Rocampnadzor on the basis of the court ' s decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of violators' websites, an automated information system entitled “Review of violators of personal data actors' rights”.
This law was passed in the summer of the Head of State.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugovo and Wadim Djonge from LDPC and Alexander Yushenko from CRC.
Jean and Yushenko are also co-sponsors of the current bill to postpone the entry into force of the Act already passed.
For those who don't have a date centre in the Russian Federation, they're going to have to pay for rent.
Commenting on the bill introduced to the State party today, the first to be chaired by a thought committee on information policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem moving the date of entry into force of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data.
He said that those companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, in "Rospleec", which had repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and were already providing their servers, with Mail Group, Western companies that were already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem -- they're going to get technological possibilities for placement," Levin said.
Competing Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill was adopted, the Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, these services include air travel and hotel online.
According to the association, “the draft excludes the entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - from the right to dispose of their own data in a mandatory manner, stating that their recording, systematization, etc. must be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the record is being recorded and to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose which territory the said acts will be carried out.
However, the adoption of such “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the provision of global services and significant economic losses.
Felt the jaw out by a bucket of ice water
Weabel Roberts of Great Britain shouted so much when ice water poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test, by the wind of ice water, went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried out so during the test by a plume of ice water that she pulled her jaw out.
Isabel Roberts was so furious when ice water poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I cried, but when I did, my jaw started to freeze," she said.
The water's on the 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts a second before an accident
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't shut up, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then the same understanding came to my mother and sister and they began to eat, but I had to be taken to the emergency office immediately.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to hospital to exercise her jaw on Tuesday.
Kleop became an Internet terminal and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Over 400 prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian military
Novorossi states that the Ukrainian Sou-27 was shot down and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian side of 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 soldiers killed.
Interfax reported this to the representative of the Army Novoroscia press service.
He added that “by means of airstrip in the area of Merek, the S-27 aircraft violated the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling Lugan airport.
The press officer noted that the militias had been able to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters in one of the field airfields in the night, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The loss of 13 people in the enemy's living force, up to a hundred people killed and wounded,” summarized a headquarters representative.
Interfax has no evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, Donbasa, the armed forces of the "people's republics", stated that the Ukrainian side had been transferred within the framework of the ceasefire of 223 prisoners of war and that of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, on the night, the DNDP army, according to Novorossia Army, “has attempted Nazi forces to withdraw heavy equipment from the area in violation of previous agreements”.
At that time, militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, total enemy casualties in all directions (Dontsk, Luganski, Mariapolski) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of the last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves in the militia environment in the Ilowaysk region of Donetsk.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, requested the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the area.
The NAM agreed to do so on the condition that weapons and ammunition be delivered by the enemy.
The first dozens of troops began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass, Semena Semenchenko, 14 more people left the county on Sunday night.
In his Feisbuke Semenchenko, the Ukrainian wounded are “in the custody of 137 fields of the 32 RF Divisions and 9 of the RF tank brigade”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID REF: Russia will respond to new sanctions by the EU
Russia reserves the right of reply to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian external diplomatic agency stated that the European Council's “opportunions” of 30 August demonstrated the failure of EU member countries to overcome the inert support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on “expressive allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country” referred to the agency's website.
MID REF regrets that Europe, in spite of the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries interested in increasing confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as the conditions for a full-fledged “dealage between the rival parties”, stressed the agency.
It is also noted on the site that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned during the next seven days.
At the same time, the EU representatives work closely with American officials.
They are expected to coordinate the measures imposed for the period of action and the degree of severity.
New sanctions by the European Union could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and oil and gas.
Three ways to save in university textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who would soon turn to a second course, developed a clever way of reducing costs.
It has developed a system of how to rent books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation for delaying their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually stands at $180, I got at a ten-year seed in Chek-fil-A liver," says Schroeder, 19, who studied at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature on the last Seestre would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Colleges Board, the average student spends more than $11,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly picking up Internet and creative ideas like the Schröder system.
The sale of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the seeds, and it is often much cheaper than buying them.
Niobo Incportade, a company with over 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books at university bookshops during the last spring ' s Semistre were rented, says Vice-President of Niobo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are acquired in university bookshops, according to the professional association “National Association of Universities”.
Here's an introduction course on the best way to make a good deal.
Internet purchase
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book might be one-third of what you'll see in a university bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler, the ninth edition of the Math Analysis, stands at about $290 per prescan, but a new copy can be purchased at $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Procurement of the retentionist
If you don't mind other people's labels or injuries, the books you've got are good.
“Mathematic analysis” is sold for $93.49 as used for Chegg.com.
Matt Casseday, 25 years old, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, said that he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a copy of the book "Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding Business Business Business Business Business".
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breysey, director of the College Without Wall, at Massachusetts University in Emherrste, invites students to explain to their professors whether previous publications could not be used.
Sometimes updates are non-existent.
In such cases, old publications often find a very small percentage of the value of the latest edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to “eBay Inc.”, a popular alternative to buying books that were used.
Protract
To rent books, you should consider if you treat them well enough, remember to return them and not want to leave them behind after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a “Mathematic analysis” at a seedster for about $20.
Learn the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may receive from your notes, highlightings, and injuries.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return a book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Cheggs and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" project on the Chegg.com website will cost approximately $61 for six months.
Breysey says that students studying literature often find the most profitable prices, because many classical works can now be shot free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering science can be very expensive.
No matter what, look at it.
Joe Holt, 29 years old, who's going to start studying at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find out the price of the book, because that guarantees that you're looking for the right text.
Before you do an order on the Internet, Gold says, I'm sure to see if there's a book in the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was postponed for four weeks, and, after all, he paid a full price at the university bookshop.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was completely ineffective
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appeared at a meeting on hostels of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the Far East budget investment, created two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
“15 billion rubles are still on deposits”, stressed the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State mandated the early adoption of the list of Territories ahead of development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of tenants had to be introduced into the Gosdum of that fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, until 1 July, has not adopted the list of Territories ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the region ' s transport accessibility, removing infrastructure restrictions, both in the domestic market and in export development.
Among other things, there was a need to create pre-conditions for attracting additional investments in the region, as well as for developing territory ahead of development that should become competitive with key ATR business centres, stressed the President.
Recall that it was previously reported that the area ahead of development could be replaced by EMOs.
Why "The Stars of the galaxy" couldn't save the cash charges
Silvester Stallone returned less than $30 million of his $90 million budget to the United States, whereas "The City of Sins: A Woman to Kill" returned only $12 million of its $170 million budget.
"The first video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to get dragon 2 is also a disappointment to the product.
Telegramah Robbie Collin’s article indicates that when it comes to children’s films, it may be that it is a bad thing to do as a film itself.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year in the history of children's films, and called "How to get dragon 2 to barely "functioning" by continuing the fenthesy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at audiences of a slightly older age, the problem does not necessarily appear to be the same as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacratic ratings to at least 2,000 copies in the summer between May and July 20, 2013 and that year.
The results that take into account both movie viewers and film critics suggest that the production of films this year is similar to that of last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be a matter of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of Internet service streams, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-sealing film called The Jungle Book, said to the Hollywood Reporter, "I think the times are changing."
We must admit that and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall of cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix income from flow reproduction services reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the last year's value of $837 million.
Last summer, Director Stephen Spielberg solved the studio for relying too much on the comics 'franches and predicting Hollywood's 'colors'.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his grim predictions included a share of truth.
As several potential cashiers are expected to emerge in the summer of 2015, including “Consistors: Erya Altrona, Miñonov and the Jurov Park”, other film industry members are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg recently described the fall of cash charges as "cyclical," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the largest cashier in history, and no one will worry about it."
Productive sanctions do not scare the owners of the facilities from the Caucasus and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and the Japanese kitchen, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the general interest so far prefers to replace prohibited imports with products, not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"Brlotti Mariano Valerio, the director of the Italian restaurant, is more likely to be talking about the quality of cheese offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italian.
Mozzarella and the burrat cheese ran out of the restaurant first, and they had a little storage term.
It's gonna take us a couple more months.
What do you do?
Going to the Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Doromomolov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not leave him to this day.
The meat was only 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything from Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's a different place.
But on the other day, I was brought to a fish trial from the Far East.
That's how it turned out!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought us this.
Valerio is so rare that many of the usual things for Italy are for a Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerating chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must hang out to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said, that's yours, Russian.
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes, walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant of Brasserie Most in the kitchen hangs stop-list indicating missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The director of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Strezka Bar, Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the Familiars in France have already replaced Tunisian herds, and instead of French cheese, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
On the other hand, Rezis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers:
I ask, "Why is it worth so much?"
I'm told, "Let's make a living too."
But this hood should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far East we buy them by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, imagine how much do they weigh?
It's at the price of superdelictres.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of horrors for foreign cooks.
"The first three months were good, and then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibres and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what happens when they're finished.

Sanitary menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the use of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is referred mainly to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, lead, meat and subproducts from the domestic bird, meat products, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, making, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, calories and sugar syrups.
Restaurants began to have chehads with suppliers: food prices had grown, and there was an urgent need to look for analogies from other countries.
This would have a profound effect on the expensive restaurants with the monochens of France, Italy, Spain, where food was shipped directly from the “material” countries.
The generals had to be renovated earlier.
For example, when in early 2014, Roselchnissor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meats.
In addition, suppliers have established the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer-2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which would result in the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, luxuriant milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be mitigated.
In the meantime, some of the restaurants are in uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoRéCa, the share of imports in the pre-region segment was up to 70 per cent.
"The world's restaurants will have to change the menu to make local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, the rector, owner of the RestConsalt agency.
If the chief cook is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few of these cooks, and the new menu can take two or three months to develop.
A Trigel from the Brassierie Bridge restaurant is ready to do this: abandon from 10 to 15 per cent of the dish, and half of the menu will be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, it's already starting to replace dishes, for example, stash from marble beefs on the beefstrogas, says Sergey Miron.
“The cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, and Tunisia, and is listed by the representative of Oxan Gybchuk.
Plums and milk products from Europe have parallels in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States may be replaced by chickens from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seven from Norway by salmon, seven, a trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In Minrov's view, budgetary restaurants are going to be much easier than the former segment, which is unlikely to be able to distinguish Italian Masell from Russian.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace it," says the Mirons.
Ginza refused to comment on the lack of ownership in the country.
The Cafe Caucasian and Central Asian kitchens emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European products.
But there are many restaurants whose sanctions are almost gone.
These include institutions with kitchens of CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"The Georgian kitchen doesn't have expensive products," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant of Saperavi and coffee "Way Me!"
We don't use any cheese in Russia. We don't use exotic greens on the basis of a lot of dishes.
No dishes have been removed from the menu at Kolbahi facilities.
Timura Lanski, the owner of Chihon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't bother him either: he's only gonna have to change a lamb in New Zealand.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we'll even win at the price, it'll be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get a cut, a lamb, tomatoes, ogulars, and fruits.
However, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than a platypist from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artakov, said that he planned to increase the export of fertile products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The historical fastephada that responded to the Deneg's request also respond to sanctions in a relatively calm manner.
McDonald's press service stated that the occupation was over 85% and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, the head of the vendor department Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products, the network is purchasing from Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise in the supply of vegetables and in the price of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
There was no more than 4 per cent of the “sensives” in Terrek.
They didn't affect the sanctions and the Walker's quotes.
KFC, Burger King and Cartoska's "Deng" did not respond, but other market participants argue that the level of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, historians are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East
On my throat.
As long as the historians complain, the rising demand for price increases even for local products.
"The price for the Grabley products has grown by an average of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio, twice," says historian Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the price of the dish will grow by 5-10%, recognizing Kolbaya.
East-West that doesn't deny, "Well, Belarusian milk products have traveled 10-15% since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers raised the prices of pigs almost twice," complains Sergey Raq, Deputy Director General of Stardoggs.
The chicken cut was going 35%.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they're going to wear hot Brazilian heads.
Stardogs will soon have a planned 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's very unwelcome to raise the prices, is Ruck.
According to statistics, the increase in general stores in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to grow, but it is not clear how fast: as long as the majority of restorers have been supplied with food for the next two months, in the hope of losing their purchase prices.
But what's gonna happen in two months, nobody knows.
The area in Moscow’s city is filled with tens of pieces of wood, ornamented with greens, and trees.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of regional products called "There's a time."
"We've been going to make a holiday for local food, and here's the sanctions, we've hurried, we organized a festival," explains one of the organizers.
In the music scene of the Greek cook Anastas, preparing a macaron salad and home confies, the other day there was a cooking class for caremed apples.
All of Russia's products, they'll assure the organizers.
In the shuttles, an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian folk farm.
The honey from Bashary, the deer from Salehard, the vegetables from the subterranean Sowsa name Lenin, the cheese from the vanquished Italianman Jay Clauza.
"Lottle for restaurants can be replaced by another salmon race from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop.
We've got the nuke, the kettle, the croaking, the peacock, the chubble, the royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he doesn't even move.
And our far east salmons don't hold you.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian Mabelell with national
In the midst of his tent, there are shrimps with the Magadan set, cracks, mud, flour, mussels with the Crimea, dams from the Far East.
Halin is sure it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
Statistics show that fish capture in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, that much of fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
The import of fish in 2013 is about 800,000 tons.
The Vowska People has been working since 2012, selling fish via the Internet shop, and before the sanctions were imposed, another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simplified Things."
Now, 15 more restaurants have been applied to Galkin.
And the same land may be made of our fish, and it is hot.
We've gotten cold, we've tried different recipes.
Now we're selling it to a million roubles per month.
Our fish are cheaper a few times, and our delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
To confirm Galkin's clothing, I'm being prepared to save Philly with the keta.
Unlike seventh - year - olds, these have to reap longer, but the realization that this fish, our domestic fish, gives us strength.
On the site of "Your People" there are even rolls from the coat and sea oats.
In the sushi bar, it's true that the Norwegian salmon will be replaced by the Chilean salmon.
Galin explains this because the cooks are about to come up with new recipes with far-away fish.
"The Russian fish has not yet been offered by the suppliers," gives an explanation to the owner of the Killfish Bar Demitry Euves.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have taken up a free niche, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and co-founder of the LavkaLavkaa project, Boris Akimov, the import from China, Israel and Latin America is now in place to replace imports from Europe and America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly reduce the prohibited imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is, the main producers of other countries benefit from the ban,” says Akimov.
The restaurant industry, on the other hand, received a more disturbing signal than the food sanctions last month.
On the basis of mass out-of-plan checks, Rosurnadzor was temporarily suspended by three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.
“We study the essence of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of public restaurants”, stated The Dayham in the McDonald's press service.
Nobody really understands what's going to happen.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous member of the restaurant consulting company.
If we start closing McDonald's all over the country, the scenario will be quite different.
Europrotocol instead of HYDOD verification
Casco payments will be free of HIBDE, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of a “europrototocol” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up a draft directive that, since 1 September this year, an insured motor vehicle will be able to obtain payments from the cashier.
It is true that there are only cases in which the accident was committed in a “europrotocol” without the participation of a road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in an accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage was no greater than the defined limit, and both drivers agreed on the issue of who the perpetrator of the accident was.
Since 2 August, the europrotocol payment limit is 50,000 roubles, and since 1 October it will be increased to 400,000 roubles in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Moscow and Leningrad.
The point is, often even with minor injuries, in a situation in which an accident can be performed by a “europrotocol”, drivers of the accident are causing DPS.
It was not possible to obtain compensation for the polyscot without HIBBs ' certificate, if any.
The parameters described in the draft guideline are precisely intended to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of a “europrotoctoole” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum amount of cash in respect of a non-GIBDE accident should not be lower than the limit for “europrotocol”.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the cash insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
But it's probably not going to come from either motorists or insurers.
The latter are now referring to a serious threat of increased fraud, which may result in the introduction of new cash payment rules.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservativeism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait for the inspector to make a minor accident, because that's more reliable.
And it is not yet known that there will be a greater delay in winning frauds, or in convincing drivers to be safe.
A safety certificate will make a nameless and non-revocable
Minphine wants to ban saving certificates on the traitor, but will let the banks make them an analogy to the irrevocable contribution.
Minphine is preparing a draft bill that will prohibit saving certificates against the traitor.
Recently, this tool has become popular, as rates are higher here than in bank deposits.
The fact is that presumptive certificates do not enter the deposit insurance system, and bank costs are cheaper because they do not have to be credited to the Investment Insurance Agency (AAU).
The probability of this move is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will be affected by the Sberbank and the Moscow Bank, which the ASV estimates control 98 per cent of the production market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to have approximately 3.5 per cent of its share.
The problem is that the clients of a small bank that bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASV if their licences are withdrawn.
Some investors may assume that their investment is insured, with insufficient financial literacy and the purchase of savings certificates on the applicant.
The justified absence of insurance payments for these certificates if the bank's licence is withdrawn could lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agencies, there have been cases in which claimants have tried to seek redress through the court,” stated AAV.
The problem is, of course, super.
After all, no one will pay certificates to buyers of certificates anyway, since they do not have the right to compensation from the State under law.
If it were the case that the tool was not insured in the AFS, it would also be prohibited with the use of metal accounts, in which citizens ' funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals: gold, silver, platinum and palate.
These accounts do not fall into the cash insurance system either, but no one has yet been hungry for their existence.
The case is most likely that the applicant ' s certificates are a very convenient securities, which may in fact be a quasi-distant.
Their movement is practically beyond control: any client of the bank may buy a certificate, transfer a certificate to any citizen, and may change many owners prior to the discovery of the certificate.
It is no coincidence that the draft law states that the saving certificate must be the exact securities to be kept in the depositary.
In order to send dust to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to be paid early.
That is, an analogy is introduced to the irrevocable contribution that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport were protested during the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the center of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Kardiff Town Hall for what was described as an antisamite.
Stephen Ferklaus followed the course of the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from far away, from Brigend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State group, with reference to the decision taken on 31 August by the representative of the Government of the FRG headed by Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Germany is reported to send to Iraq 30 portable Milan anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The delivery will take place before the end of September.
It was also decided to provide Iraq with another 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement on the subject.
To date, Germany has not placed its weapons in hot spots.
The opinion of the FRG residents about sending weapons to Iraqis was divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop the Islamic State fighters, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
A Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea was bombed by Fillers
The original militia killed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
This is reported to have occurred in the Tagango Bay near the settlement of Shiroquino and Imani (10-20 km east of Maripolis).
A number of Ukrainian media report shooting two coast guard boats.
It has been observed that the incident has taken place today at 4:20 a.m.
Adolescents were taken to a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
THE two youth who went to a safe place on the helicopter after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went off to the race shortly after noon on Sunday in Gotts Lip in Blackchite.
Intimate relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was sent, which included local police officers and a rescue unit, and a couple found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale.
The girl was damaged by her knee, and the young man fell and scavengered his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up at a swan on Monday morning.
They were taken on a ambulance in a stable condition at Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two Alliances Meet
Summit negotiations in Minsk did not resolve the issues for which they were convened but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Let the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discuss, for the first time, a number of “hot issues” on the subject of concern (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated).
Whether this structure is capable of working effectively, incomprehensible; but it is clear who removed the plumes from this summit.
Questions on this account fell on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians and other Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader set an example of repulsiveness, it was a person's behavior that just blew up jack-pot and planned to be a decent senior society.
How Majan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf, not merely the legitimacy of the President with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a full subject of European policy and as the main media player in the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Dennis Meljants, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met Tette with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be debauched," he said, "Ogonak."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maydan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU: successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and the readmission, the modernization dialogues, the Ogonika interlocutor, and international security negotiations have been held with the US.
The United States even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, the response of the leaders of Belarus to them has only overshadowed the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain its relations with Ukraine -- sufficiently warm to avoid losing much of mutual trade, and President Porosenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
Another Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in Donbas, with all seriousness, did not fight Moscow.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or the DRC, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranowich.
Brussels and Washington observed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue, and they were judged by Belarusian experts.
The success of Lukashenko's movement in political diversification will be seen in the way that Minsk will often meet in the EU+TC format in the near future.
In the EU Supreme Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about Brussels ' s expectations of a relationship in the new format.
The Spokesperson, Ashton Maya Kosyančić, simply stated that, in the face of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
However, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next meeting on the Ukrainian question, with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
President Nursultan Nazarbaev's statement, in which he confessed that he was, came out, was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to Minsk being the central site for meetings, both in the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
That means that the “last dictator of Europe” is becoming a well-served European leader who helps solve the global problem.
The Best Friend of a European Farmer
The EU delegation itself, which included Euro-commissaries on trade and energy, had already led to the conclusion that the main side of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbasa, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas transfers at the meeting and on addressing the concerns of the TC countries under the Ukraine Association Agreement with the EU appears to be more ambitious than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless, pointed out that the EU representatives “have come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine “works” on Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are given to Minsk, which, as yet, is subject to the sanctions pressure of the field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Research Centre of Misesa, an ex-commandist in the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the ability of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation to bypass sanctions.
The supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin played Minsk are being advanced at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk, "Ogonka," were not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long been operating the supply chains, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of some restoration, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies will not miss the production of Ukrainian raw materials in Belarus, as well as the orientation of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production schemes may now be quite needed.”
In Romanchuk ' s view, the role of host country for EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million in compensation to the Agrarians.
The Belarusian President can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on the euromers.
This may raise Lucashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without an initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, from its active role at birth in the TC+EC format, is being taken away, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev was the instigator of the new format.
"It was your offer to meet, without charge to discuss, not from the barahite to take a decision, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that had taken place at that time in Ukraine," he addressed the cameras to Petro Porosenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, but it was initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, Belarus is careful to emphasize that the EU-TC does not pursue a self-interesting purpose on its land, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to establish a unified economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is entirely in the spirit of the concepts that in other areas, particularly in the area of security, we have put forward and advanced the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said Ogonku in the MID of Belarus, an agency where words have recently been carefully chosen.
Zones of paid entry may appear in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the option to introduce free entry zones as a method of combating the overload of central roads, similar to that of other major cities around the world, to pass on M24.ru, with reference to the Castle of Moscow on transport issues to Maxim Likstov.
One of the options that has successfully established itself is the paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to learn it, we're going to look at everything that's negative and positive.
To say that there's been some decision on it before it's too early," Lixtov told me.
Zammair stressed that for the capital authorities, the experience of Asian cities, which are structurally and voluminously similar to that of Moscow, is very important.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of a central ring road, adding Lixtov.
The recently started construction of a Central ring road is an example of not having to cross Moscow.
If there was sufficient facilities, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow,” said the castle.
Maxim Licksutov also claimed that the introduction of wage parks had substantially overloaded the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop at what had been achieved.
Recall, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobinin, attended the construction ceremony of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Round Road (CACD).
The Shrew of the Sinful
Frank Miller's and Robert Rodríguez's "The City of Sins: The Woman for whom to Kill" committed the wrong revolution that could be expected of him.
The first “Crimin City” (2005), made with minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized between movies, comics and literary nair.
Sikvel is also a revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys a modern-moded chain called "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (under the theory of the universe, and under the antithesis, cosmos).
It should be read from now on, "the anti-thesis is chaos."
"The City of Sins-2" is both grotesque, and philosophically, and it's both kind of grotesque in the stupid sense of words.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "Goad," although, here, the thundering of Marv (Micky Rork), will be remembered, life will end up on the electric chair, and here, nothing, but, you know, it's going to be a popular wife -- a knife from the air and other fluffy toasts.
But the old people literally break up with the elbows of the new, like they're in town out of some other movie, the meaning of which is that the audience's story is asking us not to worry about.
So my story, which is shameless by the authors in the most interesting place, is that Johnny's super-divided player (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt).
Hers is the lustful, fiendy Eve Lord (Ewa Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Jos Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, face-to-face doesn't differ from Johnny, especially because faces, like other parts of the body, make the characters appear to be inexorably regular, are not a disaster or even a half-winged thing.
They're not people, we understand that these are archetypes of nira: rock bitch, too sure of the player who's at the "smart trap" of sex detective, corrupt osteoporator.
Well, when the archetype is waltzing with the archetype and the archetype, it's not a movie anymore, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
Fighters from the first "Gorade" continue to hold round defence against the slum-ridden forces of the darkness.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is not, and he'll look at the needle, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with the Greek2 is another one.
Frank Miller was really good at how a drawingman talentedly linked comics and nilar, and as a director, he flipped the idea of how to carry comics on the screen.
Comix and nir are two aggressively counter-realities.
Today's comic book was born in the late 1920s, whereas Dashil Hammet's novels entitled “Crosses of Life” (1929), “Maltic Falticus” (1930), and “Stole Key” (1931) created the nuar canon, which was then called Hard-Bolyd School.
Well or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from Popya's lord of spina, giving him wealthier power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy to Halka, Tora, Pacau Man, and other "Paco-Man".
But in any comic film, there was something harmful: the figures who were painted were determined not to grow up in the screen, and they were still ugly in their environment of the world's “real” will.
Simply put, they were totally deprived of "existance."
On the contrary, Neur is the most esthetic woman of the world's literature.
After World Wars, a traditional affair -- with experiences, personality, family scandals, and historical background -- had lost all credibility.
What are the Forts, which Tibo and Rugon-Macra, what are even the Bolkon and Rough thought even after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such an affair was peaceful in its format of soap operas, and the criminal, by definition of marginal, was raised to the level of philosophical reasoning.
Hammet found out on his skin what it is to work as a health guard on the front.
He was a Communist.
As a matter of fact, there were, at least, close to the compass and the pole pillars, such as the writers Joras Makka and Jim Thompson, the filmmakers Jule Dassen, Joseph Louze, Edward Dimitrick.
So the nair whose archetype they gave is, first of all, rough and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost a U.S. socialism version.
The first “Criminary City” was noted precisely by the fact that it was unnatural, but it organically linked the comics to the nirar.
For the first time, the comics on the screen were alive and hardly shy about their graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a real movie.
The dream of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the killings, and the senator covered a horrible stamina son, was well deserved over Hammett.
And the painting details of the sort of cut heads that the sadist decoupled his nest, the pendant James Elroy, the author of the Red Orchid, and the best, that is, the declarative voice of the neonar.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodrigues' radical slylasting before the comical tradition.
Probably because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "The City of Sins," you feel like a prisoner in a glass balloon in which the snow is falling on a toy stick.
Well, most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood shoes, but in the big account, what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when, somewhere, we have some time on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where we can bring back a girl on the curve or, say, a lifeless parent, her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place but sin in the city of sin, neither is there any sin but a standard.
It's like any rule.
The chaos of the Sins-2 is just boring.
Justice, for the sake of domestic security, gave this sin to the press, but the glove.
The tigers warn that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the sight, in the most vegetarian episode of which the fingers of a man are broken, it gives him a hell of a humor.
Hemmet would like it.
French socialists must “crush and bring France to order,” says key ally Francis Olanda
Mr. Valle called on the deeply divided left forces to “show affection” for the socialist president who had been attacked, whose repositions had not been endorsed by the overwhelming majority of French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling out applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister had assured him that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour workweek in France, despite the conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules put forward by Emmanuel McCron, the new Minister of the Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his Socialist party comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobir, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in his wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist party and exposing the Socialist party for allowing the French to “lost faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pee, leader of the very right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall Government would last for more than a few months.
François Olland is the naked king, but Prince Manuel Valle, who is forced to gather a new government when the summer has not been held.
"And a new one won't last autumn or winter either," said Mrs. Pan to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be able to run.
The French ruling party survived the breakup of the March municipal elections, and the very right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French people believed that the Socialist party risked falling into several rival factions until the end of Mr. Olanda ' s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perricno, a political scientist at the University of Siñas Po, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience unless the new socialist government was able to correct the economy and high unemployment rates.
"He's got little time, but public opinion needs to feel like something's changing fast," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The city without drugs" has been left without action
The Sverlov Court of Arbitration dismissed the action taken by the Regional Ministry of Public Administration to the State Without Drugs Foundation without consideration.
The department intended to remove more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rental fees for the building at the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverlova Court of Arbitration has left a claim without consideration by the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property of the Region (MIGISO) to the Drug-Freeland Foundation (one of the founders of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to remove 7.3 million roubles from the organization as a charge for the rental of the building.
Today it has become known that the plaintiff did not appear twice before the court, which led to the decision to refuse consideration.
The reason for the lack of representatives to the DIGESO delegation was not able to explain, and Maxim Titov ' s Head of Legal Division did not respond to telephone calls.
Nor was it possible to contact the fund.
Recall that this was a special woman who had been holding a fund in the centre of the city on the street of Belinski, 19 on a free-of-charge basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by the Governor-in-law, Alexander Mikharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Administration of the Sverlov State Department filed an action with the Sverlov Arbitration Court for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the department required, through the court, that the grant contract be recognized as a room for a memorial.
In the opinion of the MIGISO Director, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverlov Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim, then appealed to the 17th Permi Court of Arbitration, which was successful.
The fund then filed an appeal in the same court to the Court of Cassation against this decision, which was without satisfaction, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took the part in the judgement.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, and the fund began paying rent again, telling the head of the city of Eugenius Royzman.
The rent was paid to 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration has given us this building free of charge, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The present administration has decided differently," it stated.
Tatian Dragoeva, Ekaterinburg
Why Mayor Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of Ekaterinburg, Mr. Alexander Kosinski, offered to the mayor of the city, the Speaker of Euguiya Royzman, to resign.
Criminal proceedings were brought against a retired person suspected of murdering a member of the City of Oleg Kinewa, who was considered a mayor.
How Eugania Royzman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on the basis of the fact of “clave” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blogging of the Mayor of Ekaterinburg, Eugenia Royzman.
This was reported by Anna Philatov, Director of the Law Center, at the Sverlova DGU, where he made a corresponding statement.
She said that Mr. Royzman had charged her with his blog records with having been involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “this is an ongoing attempt to avenge the truth”.
the iPhone will turn into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is supposed to present his new development, there are all the new leaks in the press about what can be expected of the presentation.
Referring to sources, the United States media report that the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to the Bloomberg and Specialized Internet Resource Re/code, a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express could be launched on 9 September at the presentation of new products, which would make the iPhone 6 function available in the new smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this matter.
This function allows payments to be made on the store's cash register by means of a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by fingerprinting the finger with the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time by NFC (near field of communication), which allows for the payment of a non-combatant payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate reading device on the cashier.
The NFC technology itself will be made available through a specialized microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Phylips Semicucatores).
For the first time, NFC was represented in 2004 as part of its collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semicductors and more than a hundred other companies who entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association to advance this technology.
The first phone from NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the NFC-Samsung Nexus S function was submitted in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented a Google Wellt system to allow users to attach banking cards to their Google account and pay off with a smartphone on Android.
On the other hand, United States experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, United States miners are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with these systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into the market will still make the prospectors accelerate and increase the deployment of the technology at their trading points.
MID France: Paris' position on the transfer to Russia of Mysterlas does not change
The official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, Romen Nadal, stated a consistent position in Paris regarding the supply by Russia of helicoptermen of the Mesral.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France Allanda) in his interview to the newspaper Le Monde of 20 August: “The level of sanctions today does not prevent delivery.
This is a European decision, not a French decision," quoted Mr. Nadalya RIA News.
The representative of the French foreign policy department therefore responded to a question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the repositioning of Paris in the performance of the contract.
For more information on the supply of helicopter personnel to Russia, please read the magazine "Misral" almost ours.
Council of National Security of Ukraine: Seven soldiers were killed in the area of military operation during the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lusenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the east of the country during the past 24 hours, and 25 others were injured.

At the end of the operation, data on the losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
Mr. Lasenko added that he refused to discuss the situation in more detail under Iloway, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the NWCO, “the best thing is to return the prisoners to ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lasenco also noted that Ukrainian military personnel had departed from Luhansk Airport in the direction of Georgia's settlement.
For more information on the situation in eastern Ukraine, read in "Arsen Awakov": the first Ukrainian military left the area under Iloway."
Norwigian Cruise nears a $3-milliard deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NHL.O., the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of the negotiations to acquire a similar Presteige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide the Norwigian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market company, access to cruise vessels of the "lux" class and secured customers of Prestege Cruises, because it competes with the largest Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, and the sources were reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestege Cruises, a private investment company, Apolo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the shares of Norwigian Cruise.
Sources were requested to remain anonymous, since negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwigian Cruise and Prestege Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, whereas Apollo refused to comment on information.
North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Her income was $2,57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestege Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Osaania and Regent, which share eight cruise courts that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She claimed $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than one year earlier.
It is expected that an average growth in developing economies, such as China and India, will benefit from the 29 billion-dollar cruise industry in subsequent years.
Companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestege Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for primary public shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Gentling Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate conglomerate and a casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lima Kok Thea.
Apolo invested $1 billion in Norwigian Cruise in 2008.
Norwigian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 per cent, Apolo owned 20 per cent shares, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, owned 8 per cent of the company, according to the report at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwigian Cruise together make up 82 per cent of the cruise passenger in North America, according to registration documents for the first public share of Prestege Cruises.
Cram TV company is able to obtain 250 million rubles of grants
In the Ministry of Social Affairs of Russia, a total of 250 million roubles are being broadcast by the State television company in 2014.
According to the draft Mincomlinka regulation on a single notice portal for the preparation of regulations, the grant is expected to “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair roofs and energy supply systems in a television company building based in 1959, reports RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Actors Break the Chinese Representative's statement the following day after the election decision
The group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood in the vicinity of the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People ' s Congress established a procedure on Sunday which will allow only two or three candidates to participate in the election of Hong Kong ' s leader in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing Loivists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for a democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and has made the democratic movement activists to recommit themselves to stopping Hong Kong's financial centre by the "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following Beijing ' s publication of a document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, the Democratic Movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and set a sit-in strike.
The Li briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress of China, Jeang Rongsung, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of State of Feng Wei, were also required to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would gather at the building of the Hong Kong head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intended to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, owned by Palestinian autonomy.
According to Bi-bi-si, the decision to join the land of Southern Bethlehem is related to the desire to pay off the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defence Minister announced the occupation of the Territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administration in the West Bank.
According to Saiba Aricata, a representative of the Gaza Strip, the world public should call upon Israel to be held accountable for “the continued settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to commence negotiations on “Statehood” in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting with separatists in the east and immediately commence negotiations on “Statehood” in a divided region.
His Spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean to indicate that the East Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine must be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s appeal to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the Russian rebels as equal in line with the apparent strategy that it should take since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take over the territory and to compel the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared territory of Novorossia actual independence in order to draw closer to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Canal, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the Sémocated Territory to the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk provinces, which were captured in March and April following Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territory of Novorossia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attack peaceful settlements in secessionist regions, the “Illustian man”, told ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed within months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy by saying Pekov.
It's not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Pekov, "because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention by Secretary-General Kremlin to correct the “unbelly interpretation” of Putin's words highlighted the decision of the Russian leadership to act towards a separatist revolt in the east other than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to stand up to a much greater battle to join even the Donetsk and Lughan region of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and the interviews prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the regional Governments in Ukraine the authority to define trade agreements and foreign policy in fact, giving the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link Russia ' s main territory with the Crimea.
The main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts, is located on the Black Sea peninsula, which is joined five months ago.
The regions between the Russian Rosov region and Crimea also have mines, factories and ski factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Prosenko suggested during his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, following the new elections, should weigh constitutional amendments that would allow the regions separated to have greater control of their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who have been accused of Moscow in arming and inciting them.
Putin's latest appeal to the Kivus to agree with the separatists as equals, following the new rebel offensives' achievements last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peace field along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of the town of Novozask in an offensive, about which Ukrainian security officials say that they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coast right up to Crimea.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariapola, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between the Novoza and the narrow passage of the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Powder appealed to the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-retroversy," warned Powderka.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be taken in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two convoys of Russian armory and 1,000 military men had entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficulties of separatists, Colonel Andrey Lasenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, informed the reporters of Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported being held in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airtights captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lasenko on Sunday.
A scandal with naked photos captures Australian famouss and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to the hackers, who may have stole the naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and a complete list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was shocked when a number of frank photographs of Jennifer Lawrence’s naked hit the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with famous figures.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 frank photographs of the Cold Games star Lawrence and Superstars, including models from Kate Apton and Kara Delivin, the singers Ryan, Arian Grande and Lia Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors of Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Fearovsky, and Masbourne Greco also allegedly stole photographs as a result of iClaud leak.
The list has 101 famous names.
Edelsten, who made the Greek offer last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent out to others.
Greco, who is in New York, is reported to have told the news website that the hacker attack was a "feeling" attack and that the target people are "feeling they've invaded."
It is assumed that hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two frames of staff, in the well-skinned pool.
Palmer works in films include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chek and actress in Browning's "Prohibited Entrance" yesterday did not comment on stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ, "This is a gross invasion of privacy."
Axter Set Rogen expressed his outrage at hacker, writing on Twitter: "Seal photos stolen from the mobile phone are in fact nothing different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of nudes
The mass hacking of stars may be caused by vulnerability in annex Find My Phone.
The potential scenario of events described the resource of The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github, which allowed the passwords to be picked up by Find My Phone Company Apple.
This service allows you to track where the iPhone is located.
The same logic and password link Apple ID is used for accessing the Apple iClaud cloud, from which photographs of famous people have been stolen.
The script used to re-read the password from Find My Phone.
All possible combinations of symbols are consistently introduced, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that there was an unlimited number of password inputs in Find My Phone.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong account password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user on the hacking attempt.
Because of vulnerability, no information was received from users about an attempt to match the password to their account.
hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iClaud.
According to Hackapp user on Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago on Saturday, and it was written by a password tracking script.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to services is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such vulnerability has been used to access the distance account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister re-entered external records
While there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used in Find My Phone to steal photographs, there has been a wave of harmful acts using this service.
The hackers took over the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case of Apple, the media reported that the clouds had not been compromised but had not investigated how users had lost their share.
In Russia, too, a Twitter player was hacked by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimitria Medvedev.
If the perpetrators had access to iClaud as described above, it could also store the password for the head of government account in the Microblogging Service.
The Next Web was not able to get Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-borough
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, granted Russian citizenship to a prominent Ukrainian athlete, Anne Burak.
The decree is published on the Internet legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, an athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and asked the Federation for an opportunity to speak for the PF collection.
In 2013, she won two stages of the world's Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in a personal sense, and became a champion of peace in a mixed espheta, one of the new types of sport programme.
It retains positions of leadership during the current season.
Pursuant to the rules to address the Olympics 2016 Rio de Janeiro, it will need to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Chakhmatist Ekaterina Lagno-Lvov, a bi-colored European champion (2005, 2008), a world of blizzards (2010) and a quick chess (2014).

RAC stopped investigation into Tw-204 in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (CRC) terminated criminal proceedings on the fact that the Tu-204 aircraft had been wrecked by Red Wings.
This is reported by the Ministry's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of an aircraft commander and an engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the disaster was caused by an increase in landing speed, the failure of the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, and the unintentional exit of the engines to direct traffic.
Tu-204 airline Red Wings flight by Prague - Moscow crashed on 29 December 2012 on landing at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The airship ran out of the runway and lit up.
At the scene of the incident, an aircraft commander, a second pilot and an engineer were killed.
Two escorts were taken to treatment facilities, where the injuries subsequently died.

Alexander Emilianenko started training in SIZI
A well-known Russian fighter of mixed style, Alexander Emilianenko, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a housewife, has recovered completely from injuries and has started training.
The Chempionate reports on this.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Emilianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared wanted, and on 9 May he was detained in Tambowe following a traffic accident that caused him to have a hip break.
The amelanenko Jr. was arrested until 31 August, and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred and the investigation insisted on extending the detention until 30 September.
If the fault of an athlete is proved, he is in danger of imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most shocking stories in Alexander Emilianenko's career.
In January, Emilianenko played a technical note by Demetrius Szsnowsky, a technical associate.
Alexander is the youngest brother of the more famous fighter, Fédor Emelyanenko.
The latter is a four-fold champion of the world on mixed martial arts, a four-fold champion of the world and a seven-fold Russian champion on combat Sambo.
The anger was the most universal and functional emotion of the human race.
The angry expression of a person is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in it is not an accident but an additional means of expressing power and threats has been identified by scientists Australia and the United States.
They spoke about their discoveries in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face -- the shifted and thrown down the eyebrows, pulled out in a thin lip line, the embroidered nostrils -- is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth, the children who never saw it, notes Aaron Sal, the lead author of the study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have discovered that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he is able to dictate his circumstances, the more he is able to bring it to an accomplice by means of anger.
Researchers have found evidence of other hypotheses: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and become involved in handicrafts, to think of themselves as having the power to impose conditions on others, and to prefer violent solutions to conflicts peacefully.
In contrast with the fact that anger is primarily “the power of commerce”, scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that produce angry facial expressions should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, thereby forcing him to accept his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid a conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer persons where each of the seven elements of the angry person was present or missing, and showed them to the informers.
Although the lost eyebrows or the advance chins did not make the person angry, the study’s image with such characteristics was unanimously accepted by the more powerful physical participants.
Like animals, man’s anger is threatened by an exaggerated manifestation of his own strength, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man stirs up his nostrils and burns his lips for the same purpose as the woman who's on hold, or grandmother, who's showing off her clasps.
Gnev “starts” by refusing to accept the situation, and the person takes the form as effectively as possible showing the opposite side the consequences of the refusal.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of the angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincomlinks offered to give 250 million rubles of Crim.
Minicompanieds proposed that 250 million rubles be allocated from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization Teleradia Company Crem.
This is reflected in the Government's draft decision prepared by the department, which was read by “Lenta.ru”.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed “to cover the costs of establishing conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is anticipated that the money allocated will be converted to a hardware, video, a central hardware and a video server.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transponder.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the telecommunication fibre and optical line (OLAS) and the repair of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget for the Minsk.
The State Broadcasting Company Crime was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, television coverage is more than 75 per cent of the peninsula.
In 2011, Teleradium Creim received a digital television license.
