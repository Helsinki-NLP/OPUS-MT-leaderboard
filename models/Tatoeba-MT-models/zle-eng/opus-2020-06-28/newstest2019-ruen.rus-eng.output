Named number of Ukrainian recruits preparing to send to Donbas
The official representative of the People ' s militia of the self-proclaimed People ' s Republic of Luganese (LNR), Andrei Marochko, stated that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas.
According to him, Kiev is thus planning to “shoulder units”.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of Ukraine, mass dismissals have led to a low strength of units”, said Marochko, quoted as “RIA News”.
He also did not exclude that real numbers of Ukrainians on the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a combined force (JA).
This measure was expected to increase the role of Ukrainian soldiers in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasa was aggravated by the assassination of the head of the NAM Alexander Zaharchenko.
The NAM authorities characterized what happened as a terrorist.
Several individuals involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
Preliminary data indicate that the diversification was organized by Ukrainian special services.
The U.S. authorities forced Macka to leave the post of Chairman of the Tesla government
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave office as chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla based on the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle claims, the Federal Monetary and Exchange Commission will also pay $20 million to the enterprise community.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows Macka to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
In doing so, he is obliged to pay $20 million and to leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to his seats.
It is stated that the agreement is yet to be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the U.S. securities and Exchange Commission had accused Massa of misleading shareholders of having sufficient funds to buy out the shares of the company and had filed an employer with the court.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy the Tsla shares for $420 apiece, but he never did.
The company grew by almost 11 per cent after the Twitter.
The head of British MI da compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being captured by the member countries of the community.
Such a statement was made by the diplomat at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson in history is clear: if you turn the EU out of the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He also added that trying to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gasta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had come to an impasse.
In this way, she commented on the outcome of the European Union Informal Summit in Tlatelolco.
The Brexit decision was taken in 2016 following the referendum.
It is expected that the United Kingdom will leave before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.
South Korean President gave two dogs to the Mingling Mushroom
The President of South Korea, Mun Zhae Ine, was given a gift from North Korea leader Kim Jong Yin, after his visit to Pyongyang.

"At the summit, a pair of phunson dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday," reported the department.
Dogs around the year, “as assistance for their adaptation”, the North Korean side passed several kilograms of food.

The phunsonic arts from North Korean wolves received their name from one of the DPRK districts.
As the agency points out, Moon loves animals, and he already has two dogs that he's given to North Korea's last leader Kim Jong Il.
Dogs are not the only gift.
Kim Cheng Yin also handed over two tons of disqualified masukue mushrooms to his colleague.
He ordered that the mushrooms be distributed to members of families separated during the Korean War who had not yet been reunited with their relatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The head of the Altay Selsowite stopped the hunger strike in favour of the inhabitants
The deputate reported on its Facebook page that it had stopped starving for several reasons.

However, no one has yet started to do so.
The Head of Agriculture also protested against the lack of proper control and support by the Government of Altay Province and against the financial policies of Gasprom inter-regionalgas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper training of the villages for the winter, Boronin required “a full and autonomous municipal community with the relevant state units immediately to be set up in the municipality”.

The user's phone number can be found from his jeweler
Complaints relate to virutes with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after updating, the annex shows the white screen or immediately closes.
The Messenger's representatives responded to a crash.
They said that the problem could be the migration of information into a new annex, written in Swift.
Telegram suspended the automatic updating of the application until the problems were corrected.
On 13 April, the Moscow Court of Tagan upheld the Roskinadzor ' s case of blocking the Messenger Telegram in Russia.

The reason was that the Messsenger administration refused to provide the FSB with the keys to decode correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its confidentiality policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and the mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court order was reached.
Telegram audience reduced by 1.2 million after locking in the FF

It's very important for us to win.
After the St. Petersburg match, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind and prepare for Minsk.
They knew that Dinamo had a good victory before our meeting, so they prepared themselves very seriously.
It was important to throw away in the majority, and I'm glad for the boys who took advantage of it.
We've been good at most lately, but we haven't been able to kill anything.
Finally a red light outside the gate lit up.
We knew Minsk would go out on a game, try it, it did.
Most of the games have become a defining, winning goal, and we've killed in exactly the unequal compositions.
We were able to spend a very good third period today, despite the fact that we had missed the early head in that section and understood that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played a great defense, we didn't give a lot of chance to the rival, we couldn't catch us on the shift, we didn't have attacks with a multiple advantage, so it ended well for us, and that's what Hartley's press service says.

RBC reported an early resignation from the Governor of Kurgansk region
The Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Cocorin, will retire as part of the new rotation of the Governor's Corps, reports the RBC with reference to two sources close to the administration of the President.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board
The US Security and Exchange Commission and the founder, Tasla Ilon Musk, settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNC News.
According to the television station, within the framework of the agreements, Masku will have to leave the post of head of the Tsla Board.
At the same time, the Commission allowed Masku to remain the leader of the Tasla.
According to the Tsla founder, an administrative fine of $20 million will also be paid to the court.
That's the same amount as Tesla.
In doing so, money will be shared among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American enterprise that comes into the list of the 50 richest people of the planet by version of the Forbes magazine.
It is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neurallink neurotechnic company and the creator of the Tesla electrocars, and the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tsla Ilon Macka for his report in the Twitter about a possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Moscow announced plans to make Tasla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock at $420 was allegedly “because of the importance of this number in the marijuana culture” reported earlier to the Bloomberg agency, referring to Stephen Peykin Commission security director.
In doing so, Ilon Musk subsequently refused his plans to buy shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. securities commission and exchanges, the businessman stated that he considered fraud charges to be unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and disappointed by those claims.
"Signity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against the Macca with a claim for financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of businessmen had caused them damages.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the Twitter businessmen were misleading, making the Tsla shareers forced to purchase paper at artificially overvalued prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the unwary remarks by Ilon Macka led to dramatic fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilon Macka accused the head of the Citron Research research company in the stock market.
However, had Moscow not been able to settle its dispute with the U.S. securities and exchanges, he would have been in danger of being suspended from the company's management and even from prison.
In particular, the former Chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission has stated this to the CNBC television channel.
Musk is a "good guy who doesn't know how to drive a car company."

The RCF compared the possible re-name of UPC to fascists
The head of the Division of External Church Relations (OECS) of Moscow Patrarchate, Mitropolitan Volocolmsky Ilarion, compared the possible re-name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the activities of fascists in Germany.
Mitropolitan Volocolmsky Ilarion - the causes of the conflict with Constantinople patriarchate, possible church divisions and its political subtext
He said now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage," changing the name of the church -- even though in Fascist Germany, "Jews are stuck with a yellow six-point star."
“This means marking the Church as an organization of hostility, and for that purpose this bill has been created,” said the RTC representative on the television channel “Russia 24.”
Mitropolit also emphasized that UPC was not a Russian church but Ukrainian church, since “the believers of that church considered themselves Ukrainians, they were patriotics of their country”.
UPC called on the Constantinopol eczarachs to leave its territory

On September 30, 1928, or exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the modern antibiotic era, brought global glory to Fleming and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the use of penicillin from shoulder mushrooms was not the first to open Fleming.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he sat down on a Petri dish of his nose (that is, a glass cap with bacterial experience) and found that the bacteria there had been destroyed a few days later.
In almost the same way, penicillin was discovered.
The name Fleming has been put on the list of 100 most prominent personalities in human history.
His discovery, many scholars believe, has changed history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the most common diseases, previously considered incurable, namely tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived at the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspaper wrote: “For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than a dozen divisions.”
Experts estimate that the discovery by Fleming of the first antibiotic in the world saved the lives of over 200 million Earth’s inhabitants.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London congregation of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our husband and I took note of this by a Russian - speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming, in full growth, was seen in the most unexpected place in the capital city of Spain.
There, near the main arena for the Plas-de-Toros-de-Las-Ventas Cordors, the well-known Spanish mother-in-laws installed a monument to a man whose efforts were saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of Cord.
By the way, this very interesting paint work, I think, was found in Madrid, but not at all.

Trump told me about "love" at Kim Jong Yin
United States and Democratic People's Republic of Korea's leadings have barely been in love with each other, and they have been kidding Donald Trump.
United States President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his successes on the front line to resolve the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now rectified relations so that they are hardly in love with each other, noted the American President.
The White House host recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main complexity of foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had been so active with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that I couldn't even call the country's leadership.
At that time, the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader writes beautiful letters to the White House, observed Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, Kim Cheng Yin was also violent, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has turned out so far that the leaders are "in love with each other."
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the United States media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that, recently, Pynyang had ceased nuclear and missile testing, as well as closed military mines.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, a certain American president.
In the past Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke up about Kim Cheng Ein from the rostrum of the United Nations.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to declassify tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would continue until the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore

The outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remains of American soldiers.
Along with that, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had been sent to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the Singapore summit, but that Phenyan rejected them, calling them “Hangsterian”.

It called for the expulsion of the "Moscian language" by a Ukrainian product.
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of their mother tongue, Laris Nicea, called for the expulsion of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow's”.
To do so, she offers Ukrainian product - “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
For its reasons, “the feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine” was shared with the Ukrainian publication “Ospital”.
She said that the relevant Ukrainian product was now being prepared -- it was even there and was continuing to develop further.
In time, Ukrainians are “healthy” from this ‘Moscow language,” she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it was practically nonexistent.
However, the Ukrainians do not, according to Nietz, use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in its view, merely “the expansion of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
It had previously shared its experience of maintaining a Ukrainian regime in a children's camp in Carpathah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watson bookstores, one of which had been communicating with her in Russian.
Not getting his way, Nitzia threw her hand into the girl's hand.
The use of Russian words to Ukrainians is called “loyal schizophrenia”, calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
The name "Ruz" was recently said to have been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The angry writer could not escape even the Ukrainian Security Service: when she came there and heard the conversation of his employees in Russian, she committed a scandal and walked out of the door.
During the pause, a man’s conversation took place, and that brought forth his fruits.
The guard for the Urala, Denise Kulakov, is a victory over the Arsenalm (2:1) game of Russia's ninth tour of championship.
"Denise, what did you think he was able to win?"
"I think we want to win more," cites the words Kulakova's official Urala website.
" This difficult game has been played, and a serious male conversation has taken place during the break, and this has produced its fruits: they have killed two balls and they have not missed.
"You missed several matches because of the damage you sustained early in the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If I've had 90 minutes, I mean, it's okay!
I really felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, a little bit of the force, so it doesn't happen.
Yes, Doctors and Physicist Vladimir Anatolevic Gusov took me to this game, for which they are very grateful.
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after the victory, you'll be able to recover more easily, and the attitude in the group is good.
Now we had a white strip, although we had a black first.
We need to continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the sick."
"It's been playing for a while that didn't go to the field?"
"It's just that, it's a little bit boring, because, in fact, it's really a bad situation.
But once again, thank the physical therapist and the doctors for putting on their feet.
Most important of all, we have won and encouraged sick people.
And everything else is slow."

In the Sunday referendum, citizens are invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, at a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, where the border between the two countries passes, Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It includes the use of the name “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The treaty should not only resolve the multi-year country name dispute but also open the way to NATO and the EU.

The Daestan Deputy Prosecutor's Prosecution was news.
The Soviet District Court of Mahakkula detained for two months a deputy from the Daguestan People ' s Assembly, Rajab Abdulatip, suspected of being a member of the criminal community, who had disabled for bribes.
“As a result, the details of the investigations have been known, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramasan Abdulatip Rajab Abdulatip, has now been instrumental in criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Maged Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, the operational and research activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs found that Rajab Abdulatip had lobbied the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as the head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that purpose.
Recall, previously, the consequence of Maged Mahachev, other leaders and members of the territorial offices of the medical and social assessments under his authority has been to initiate criminal proceedings under article 210 (constitution of a criminal community using and participating in a position of service), article 290 (recruitment of an organized group), article 292 (during tax), and article 159 (special fraud).
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatip, aware of the illegal actions of Maged Mahachev and his accomplices in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined in their activities by joining the criminal community.
As head of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Dagestan and having relations with public authorities and law enforcement agencies, and enjoying his relationship with the head of Dahestan, Rajab Abdulatip, the investigators are of the view that “the activities of the other parties to the criminal community have been monitored, have established contacts with public officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the Federal Treasury Office of Medical and Social Expertise in the Republic of Dahestan, have organized the illegal establishment of persons with disabilities for citizens”.

The Court arrested a member from “One Russia” not ten days before the charges were brought, as was the case with previous high-ranking Danish officials, but immediately for two months, since he had a section 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the investigation to be brought, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Coschav: At the 73rd UN Henassabli, the subject of Russia in a negative way was practically missing
The Head of the Federation Council for International Affairs, Constantine Coschaev, considers the 73rd session of the UN Genas Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the global world ' s problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in respect of Russia has now been on the order of a more perjury” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had, at times, “as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, but also with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in that row, in any case, in a group of Western countries that was sufficiently unanimous on that occasion”.
At the 73rd session, Coschaev stressed that “the current of Russia in the negative is practically non-existent”.
"If I look closely at the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus was not exactly accurate," the politician remarked, pointing out that Russia was “no longer a wall trained by a tennis ball.”
The Head of the Sovfeld Technical Committee does not rule out any trend that, in his view, “will be allocated the current session [the United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may be fully demonstrated one year later, two, three”.
“I do not rule out that the current session may in a sense be turning”, allowed Koschav, explained that “there are only many examples of how with Russia’s involvement it is able to move forward in international affairs”.
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as examples.
“Unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be overrun over time,” added parliamentarians.
This is because he believes that there is “an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not simply an integral participant in addressing the global problems of our day”.
"I wouldn't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere to get a point behind which the movement is no longer going to go backwards, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important sense” in this context, Koschaev referred to “a question for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Genassimbli session] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that, if the Russian opinion, Russian vision of what was happening in the world, on a large scale, was not interested, the situation is now different”, said the Chairman of the Sovfeld Committee.
In his view, this is because “in the so-called new liberal order that surrounds the West, there is no answer to questions about how to address the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, migration”.
“And there is a request for a Russian vision that is becoming increasingly clear” expressed Koschav ' s confidence, stressing that it considers, in this sense, “the current session is a good one for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia”.

In Damascus, the right to use military force in Idlib was declared
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib, there will be no military force, declared the head of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Mulalm.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly address the problem of the removal of fighters from the prohibited Russian organization Jebhat Al-Nusr from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports "RIA News".
The Head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the territorial problem east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek secessionism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the SDF Kurds were good until they were interrupted by the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Rejep Erdogan, agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
It was reported earlier that a 37-year-old defender had negotiated a transition to Moscow's Spartak.
According to RT, with reference to Mirror, the former captain of England's fee, John Terri, led a youth team called Chelsea.
According to a well-known player who has been a member of the London Club for a long time, the team will not be over 23 years of age.

The first vice-president of the Supreme Council, Irina Heraschenko, apologized to the convicted person in the Russian Federation for being "spioney" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suzchenko for not being able to release him from the walls.
She said this in her video to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushenko FSB.
She said that there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris during those days, and that participants had announced a hunger strike demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them there are well-known people who are starving, supporting Oleg Sengsov, other politicalized Kremlins, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview where the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian authority, all of us, have demanded no pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with a single demand - the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Romana, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and the children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea - told Gerashenko.
It also expressed its confidence that the tests would kill every Ukrainian, making us “brighter to defend Ukraine's national interests, to protect every Ukrainian, to know what is good and what is evil”.
Recall that Ukrinform’s correspondent in France, Roman Sushenko, was arrested by Russian soldiers on September 30, 2016, at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying at the Directorate General of Intelligence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of high-security colonies, and the Supreme Court of Russia found this verdict lawful.
The Russian jailers granted the last request to the Ukrainian prior to his entry into the colony.

Wahtang Kikabidze on cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they manage oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, but the story of popular people winning cancer offers hope for many patients.
A well-known actor, Wachtang Kikabid, admitted to living only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that was pronounced as a sentence.
"I'm like a hammer down on the skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
We put it in the hospital.
There was no spoon there, standing couldn't, falling all the time.
We started to do the tests, it turned out the bad stuff, the artery doesn't go through the blood.
They took me to Moscow, they said that I had a big dungeon whale in my head, and they made an emergency operation.
And in the course of the operation, the doctors saw the tumor, and told Kikabidze in the "One time."
The guard was vicious.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi people even came to say good-bye to the Kumir at the door of his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow her living actor to be kept alive; she believed that she could cope with the illness and for more than a year did not depart from the bed of her beloved spouse.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was just like a rock, admitted to an actor.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and he is now happily living in his home in the centre of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumors of his sickness are disproved, the untimely death that occurs in the Network.
The creators of the Miroman site were introduced into the “Capacity” section of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sijärto.
The reason was “buying Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
In addition, the head of MID of the neighbouring countries has been involved in “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support of separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as in the participation of “in the organization of provocations aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation”.
Note that before Siyarto, the Governor of Kievo-Pierc lavre Paul and the chairman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots) of Onufrey agreed.
Their opposition to Tomos of Ukraine’s local church led them.
Previously, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian nationals in Zakarpatit, President Petr Porosenko demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities called the sum of the golden paraschuta to the Hungarian Zamundirator.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronje district of Yuriu Agibalova was based on the regional law on public posts.
At the same time, the real amount of the gold umbrella released from the post of viro official was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press service.
According to the law, the salary for the post of Agibalova is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the lump sum was less than the income tax of 223,892 roubles than the 1 million roubles that the media had written about.
The employee received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has served in public office for over nine years.
The appointment of the pension and the lump sum payment are made immediately after the resignation, explaining to the RAA News agency in the Government.
At the same time, the payment of pension payments to Agibal was suspended on appointment for public service, and his salary did not change as compared with the previous period.
The rimo governor of the region, Alexander Gousev, took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was dismissed following the expiration of the term of office of Head of State.
Similarly, the powers of other officials serving in public positions in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, Telegram-Nazigari published documents of which it was believed that Agibalova, who had resigned from the post of Governor-General, had paid a termination allowance of 23 salaries and that two days later he had been given a similar post without the addition of viro.
Gosumat's deputate called for telling school girls about the harmfulness of masturbation.
It is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers were raising up the harmful information they find online.
This is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy added.
Gennadja Onishenko, deputy to Gosdura RF (in an interview with the Gavorit Moscow radio station):
As part of the general sex education of children, this is to be done by explaining to the mouth, because there is a risk to a child's sexual health, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it's that a child's maturation is early enough, and there are still large knives between his or her sexual encounters and the opportunity to engage officially in inter-seminar contacts.
The problem is seen as being hampered by “femaleity”, neglect of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are exposed to the ethanim.
The deputate believes that lessons on the harm of pornography are primarily found in schools of the “hyper-urban” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're just not going to understand you, to put it mildly," said the professor.

AdG became second most popular in Germany
An anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" is on top of another popularity record, and Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
It appears that the Germans began to rise seriously from the immigration policy of Angel Merkel, which led to the country ' s long-term goal of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most likely, this is the case in recent social studies, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the position of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehofer is losing ground.
This week, the AG beats another record up on the second page in a popular sympathy rating.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 per cent popularity, were able to pass around social democracies, with a rate of about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point could be written off as a statistical error, but it should not be noted that the AG of a small group of Eurosket economists established in 2013 has become a major political force.
The leaders in total set-off continue to retain the ruling cluster HS/HAC, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there was a tendency to lose eyeglasses - back in April, the support of the Angel Merkel block was four percentage points above.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is reduced.
Today, 48 per cent of the Germans are in favour of Angel Merkel, 7 per cent less than last year.
Add that “green” (15%), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent) have been set up following the socialdemocracy.
Alternatives Evolution
The "Alternative for Germany" Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which was made up of a member of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially found itself in the opposition to the Government course, but at the outset only dealt with economic issues, including the euro and EU interactions.
At the same time, the group opposed the “subservation” by Germany of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the full exit of the country from Europe.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the AdG has increased.
In 2013, the group was formed into a full party that took up a zero of Europeans and began to severely criticize the Government for failing immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AG was able to try for the first time in Bundestag, receiving 94 members of the Parliament (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" obtaining seats in Europe.
Published by a video with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens "an idiotic race"
The leader of the political top show on Ukrainian TV, author of the two books by Stope Droddow, admitted to being his compatriots by "an idiotic race."
They'll watch TV and read little.
Drosdov noted that it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We haven't been promoting since childhood a culture of reading and publishing texts,” said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the Independent State Committee on Television and Radio has begun to fight against literature, which contains the slightest hint of criticism by the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the importation of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians set up a machine in the case of acapalipsis, a magazine on the Dr.
Anyone who wants to buy that car can buy it.
The company, Rochell Development Agreements, stated that it was already accepting applications for its new bronze.
Rushel Sentor APC APC Apolypsis Bronvic
Not only video players, movie studios, and book publishing are making money on the theme of apolypsis.
New cars are being set up for themselves as well.
Yes, Canada's Rochell Development Lines presented his armored Apolypsis Senothor APC.
At ease of imagination, the company’s engineers have created armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Sentor APC is designed for 12 passengers who are equipped with no special comfort, but who are placed in complete safety in a whole-walled bronze shell.
This bunker, or you won't call it, because its reservation level is in accordance with standard B7, installed on the chassis of a powerful Word Super Deuty plum.
Its length, also armoured, can protect the podium from grenades and anti-personnel mines.

To ensure that the gravity of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Rochel Sentor APC is equipped with a 330-strong turboise engine of 6.7 litres, with all the power of which is transferred to four wheels of a bronze via a 6-step automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting a full-blown apolypsis Rochel Sentoor APC.
To see the Apolypsis APC armory will be available at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., to be held in October.
The name of the death of the universe
The universe is still living about 140 billion years, a decade more than the world in sight, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international team of scientists has been published in the Library of Electronic Precents arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing the publications of the Aeronomic Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
This was the conclusion of the Subaru telescope’s HSC camera (HHHuprime-Cam) for about ten million galaxies.
Having examined the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy-power of the world being observed, scientists have estimated the rate of expansion of the universe slightly slower than previously considered.
Subaru's press release noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of mother distribution in the universe, and the consideration of the data of the Planck European Space Telescope clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of the CLDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments in favour of the end of the world that had been observed, 22 billion years later, as a result of the great gap.
An ad hoc attempt to merge pension referendum proponents failed
The opportunity to find out the people ' s views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely.
In Moscow, a meeting of a general initiative group against raising retirement age was held on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered the different language of the issues (the entire Centre recorded five texts).
They decided to apply to CIC for registration of a single action group and ask the Russians: “Do you have no improvement in the age of retirement under the pension law as of 1 July 2018?”
The wording was registered by a volunteer sub-group whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the most simple and legal figure.
Most participants in the meeting were supporters of Ili Sviridov (six subgroups) and CRC (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronje and Orenburg, joined them.
Sviridov used to say “Victims” that invitations had been extended to all instigators, and that consent to come had been expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But for example, Marina Semedov, the head of the volunteer sub-group (which was supported by 15 more subgroups), said, "We have not received invitations and have not planned to come, "We have not understood who is a friend, but who is an enemy."

At Loko's mat - Akhmat, Turbin's faults were babbling out of the horn of abundance.
The former judge of the Allied category Vladimir Lévivian commented on the work of the arbitrator Eugenius Turbin in Russia's 9th lecture of the Russian champion's Lokomov, "Achmat", and dealt with the controversial episodes of play.
- How do you judge Eugenia Turbin in Lokomoov's match - "Achmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his opposition to the justice of the Russian Prime League's match.
I am surprised that the emphasis of the fifth round of Spartac - Dinamo, or Turbin himself, or the leaders of the DIA has not drawn serious conclusions on his low qualifications.
The result was not slow to say in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private permits of rude receptions, were made of an abundance of horns.
For example, for the 50th minute, Editra's railway's handcuffed up Rolfoo's attorney in her fine space.
The gate's eight meters away, but Turbin doesn't set a fingernail.
- How do you estimate an episode involving Judas, who was 82 minutes old when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
- I think it was a deliberate play by a defender's hand in his prison space.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he's got a good look at this episode and his first associate on the right.
This moment should also have been seen by the standby judge, Sergey Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three were missing, and no executions were appointed.
So the score is distorted, and sports justice has turned out to be wrong.
It was the very case of judges being driven and buried by a sports spirit.
- At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest lawyer, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration of applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should've shown the second pot?
- At this point Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show exactly about the case.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov told me after the match about the double standards of justice, that some crews are being given the penalty for violations such as the incident with Idov and not.
What do you think the football player said?
- Look at what's understood under double standards.
There was a toolbar.
They didn't give him.
So the arbitrator does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's used.
And then the second point of the double standards, the judge's watching who's playing.
There's a big claim to Turbin's work because the team was under attack on Saturday Lokomov and Ahmada.
Matt Damon played a rape accused by Judge Kawano at the beginning of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate before the U.S. Supreme Court of Britta Kawano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturday Night Live transmission season on the NBC television channel.
During a small stack, the actor played Kavano at the Senate hearings on the charge of rape.
The candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailing of his stories during his interview with Senator Amy Clobusar.
Kawano, for example, repeatedly admitted to his love for beer, but stated that he never drank before unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself for rape, Kawano claimed that he had been a virgin during those years.
Damon also played these points.
I was just doing that I was drinking a lot, and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin I've ever seen.
"Everybody knows this," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Kawano had previously been elected as U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Straisand found his cloned dogs strange in behavior
The American singer Barbra Straysand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were acting quite differently from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
Indeed, [the clones] look like it, but it is impossible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog to be a coton-de-creeer, who had to be asleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog, called the Miracle Milli (Mircale Milly), who was called the world's smallest dog, was cloned in 49 times.
Professionals try to clone six-year-old animals in an attempt to understand why they are so minimal.
The US has been considering the Russian maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies.
In the United States, the Russian marine blockade could be launched to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have fought so hard for the success of the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
On the possibility of a sea blockade, the head of the U.S. M.I.A., Ryan Zinke, spoke about the possibility of a sea embargo.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform civilian functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement was fully within the competence of the agency under his leadership, although he was not deprived of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pitcairn, Zinke stated that, thanks to the U.S. naval forces, they were in control of sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington ' s desire to prevent Russian transfers to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia is still receiving its lion share of its revenues from the supply to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to allocate energy supplies to the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, confident of Zinka.
The Minister made it clear that the United States was still looking forward to leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
To that end, Washington will have to be harassed by Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, which is an acceptable measure in that direction, considers Zinke.

Formula-1 Grand Primacy of the Russian Federation
Russia has a club that I've been watching.
Former Captain Chelsea and England's prefabricated John Terri, the reason why they went to Russia's ninth tour of Spartak's championship (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm watching.
It's been a while ago, and I was curious to look at him.
I can't say that I'm a hospital because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartaku, and I want to apologize for the decision I made, and I bring Terry's word to the Chelsea Lobby.
Remember, the "Robs" with 18 points rose to third place in the tour table, while the "Spartak" was placed on a fifth line with 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white will be playing on 7 October with Enisey, and Valeria Karpina's trustee on the day before he comes to Orenburg.
The expensive violin was placed in the Lobby for a place of interest.
When in the town of Somerville, Massachusetts, the LBC Boutiqué and Loan a man brought a violin that looked like an old and unpredictable tool, the Lobard worker offered only $50.
But the experienced shop manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
And it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinand Galiano and estimated at $250,000.
Only stickers to the violin are estimated to be between $160,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the city's inhabitants, and the tool was returned to the rightful owner.
So far, it is not known how the violin fell upon the man who gave it to the Lombard, but there will be no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all those bringing the violin to the Lombard will ask to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round, the RPF is waiting for us to face an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will take at its stage in Tushina, under Valeria Karpin, a human being, as is known, not at all a foreign "people's team."
The special pictoriality of this meeting is that clubs now have an equal number of glasses - 15 and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tour table, leaving a long-drawn Zenita and in one eye from the Cosnodar who plays with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red and whites now have a rough strip: the club is surrounded again by idiotic scandals, and in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew off the Rapidou, and recently he left the Akhmatou house.
Following a fight with the CSA, which ended with a fair end, Spartak, played the “Chernoorec” with no difficulty, and as long as it was too early to talk about whether Russia's most popular club had drawn close to getting out of the crisis.
The three matches could not win in a row, but the injury didn't know about five more matches.
Let's see if Karpin can extend a win-win series like this.
The previous Carinsky Rostova meeting with Spartacus ended up in favor of the capital team.
The home is at 7:00 p.m.

London has been charged with Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, saying British Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England would defend its values, he stressed during his speech at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies operate in gray zones by means of cyberattacks and false news, and the Minister added.
But the largest is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly denied, transmitted to the TSS.
On the other hand, the head of British MID Jeremy Hunt reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it failed to abide by international regulations and use chemistry.
Hunt referred to the story of the poisoning in the English city of Solsbury in March of this year by the Gree Sergea Scripal, who was convicted of spying in favour of Great Britain and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a referendum is held to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a passionate advocate of the name of the Republic in Northern Macedonia.
International organizations have observed preparations for the referendum and today's vote.
Jan Petersen, Head of the Monitoring Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, described Euronews as the organization of observers:
Approximately 100 teams moved around the country to observe the whole process today, from opening the polling stations to closing them, then counting the votes and drafting the protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams were working in the country, monitoring preparations for the voting process, the media, the implementation of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Doulgeri: “Nearly 500 foreign observers are closely following the vote.
The observer groups record the details and communicate with members of the electoral commissions in order to set them forth in the final report.”
The interpreter compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans
There are different but few differences between Russian and German peoples that play no important role in understanding.
On the International Day of the Translator, 30 September, Bairbel Sacks, a synchronous interpreter, spoke about this.
It has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events in peace, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "for a long time, they'll be able to go."
But I don't think that's a significant role for understanding peoples and for the work of an interpreter," said a specialist in the commentary "RA News."
According to the interpreter, to understand that two countries have no choice but to “know the story”.
And in the future, Sackse noted, Germany doesn't have the point of ignoring Russia.
Russia is the natural part of Europe, it doesn't make sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are lots of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to link and maintain relations with Russia.
She said that for Berlin, the project of a gas pipeline entitled “North Stream - 2” was particularly important, which was built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

The most frequent amounts are one rouble and 50 copies.
At the time of publication of the sign, the Russians donated Vera Hansa 1633 rubles.
Fund collection opened on 28 September after Ghana ' s low-income complaint.
She said that the average salary for a deputy was 380,000 roubles, of which there was nothing left, and therefore had to be spent on a credit card.

At that time, in Gosuma, it was stated that it would consider paying hospitality to the deputies.

The best actor was named Argentinean Dario Grandinetti for "Rodo" film.
The director of the same film, Benjamin Knight, was the best director.
The evening school was headed by an American boxing officer.
In the last Friday, U.S. film theater "Educational School" earned $28 million in its first weekend.
This result led to an unsavory picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in their primary role to lead a United States boxing office from 28 to 30 September.
In the international market, only 20 countries have yet to produce a film of $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle behind the first line of the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, was quite tangible, in advance of another Western bird, a cartoon called Smolfoot, an interesting story of familiarity with a human-kind representative who never believed the hero in existence.
The Kary Kirkpatrick project and Jason Reisiga collected $23 million for their launch holidays, in general met the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million for the weekend.
With regard to the total fees for Smolfoot, they currently amount to $386.6 million (which has been debuting in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active country in the area, with a film of 3.6 million square miles [3.6 million].
A three of the strongest on this occasion locked up the child's story of "The Secret of Houses With Times" from Elya Company's horror master, finally proving that the director was able to do quality films and 12+ audiences.
During his second week, John Bellers, with his charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchet, had earned $12.5 million, bringing together worldwide fees to 53.8 million.
Despite taking off from top 3, it is still surprising to see "+" a trillionaire with Blake Lyveley and Anne Kendrick "Simplified": in 17 days in the United States, Paul Figa's painting, from which some unrealistic financial performances were not originally expected of the words "separate," collected $43 million (including 6.6 million in 28-30 October) and now has a total of 62.9 million total benefits.

The spin-off of 24 days' imprisonment in the United States (and, of course, not only) has a $330 million total wage on its account and has since been proud to bear the title of the most successful French film, which also includes two parts of the "According" itself and two tapes about the chewing doll of Annabel.
Following the horrors of Corina Hardy, another representative of the nun - debutant of Helfest, one of the main youth choirs of the year, was named after the last weekend.

Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seven became the rich Asians ($4.15 million) who don't seem to fall out of top 10 American boxing office: the romantic comedy, which has been inhabited on the screen for the seventh week, the sixth largest cash tape rating in the entire history of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the painting has thus far earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky men who had been caught in the United States for 28-30 September, they became "Hysznik", "The White Boy Rick", and "Bagreen Meat," who earned the last weekend $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively.
We'll add that in the next weekend in the United States, you'll have a lot of wine with Tom Hardy, who, you can be sure, will take over the leadership of the American box office at the beginning of the first weekend of October.
Of the other Prime Minister's week ahead, it's worth sending a musical-mlordrama "Zveda was born," a Venecan film winner from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hatred".

Valery Bellov, the Lord helped Siberia today.
Valery Belov, the chief trainer, is about the defeat of Siberia (3:4) in the regular championship of the HLC.
"Callega has been talking about Siberians, and I want to mention our sick people," is the words of the White's official Witnessa website.
"I hope they're going to support the same, because it's almost every single single game, a good atmosphere.
It's probably the Lord's help today's Siberian game, because they're very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
In fact, we lost a micro0:3 match with our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to pull this match out, even though we had moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because, apparently, we missed something in preparation.
It was a different team than the other match."
"It's an unsavory bushy."
The audience's outraged by Agutin's choice on Golos show.
The viewers of the Golos 60+ show accuse the mentor Leonida Agutina of "unspicuous cosmos and a lot of stubble."
When he learned from his first note the voice of his father, Nicholas Agutin, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings were won, and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many thought it a joke, but excused the mentor in the first phase.
But the Shush has been prolonged, and the father of the star has taken the place of more worthy performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we screeners of the show were outraged by the colossus of the vague and frank exposing of our close relatives on the final ladder.
I have even doubted that Agutina will not have enough strength and conscience to hold his dad to the end of the day, so Irina Petrivsky and Xiasia Laryn were in the TV program.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin, the fine performers who were really drinking, while Nicholas Petrovich whispered the moving song about Mom by explaining it to the audience that they still want to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that it's not the case that spectators want an objective assessment and see in the finale truly talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I feel like Goloss from Agutin's team, they've been condemned."
"The last time Aguin showed him how much he loved Dad, and today he had to show himself a professional."
"Contract has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave a dad in the draft who doesn't sing, how can you then call a mentor?"
"Do like the poet, organize him a concert in Kremle for your money, and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a Golos show, not a Big Relative show.
"On the part of Agutina, it was unprofessional."
"Then, on your own show, you have to offer to speak to your dad, not to show for the money of 1 Canal."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took a place.
And I don't understand why a silent dad should be asking me to understand more than any other participant with real identity data.
Why was the workman of Surguta with an excellent voice and a blackout, and Pope Agutina led to the finale?
And then we all complain that on the stage and on the screens the same faces are the same for decades!
For it is not by any means that you try to break through the bush.
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's all blab and rubber.
And the money in the family budget is not going to be too much!
The theatre's absurd!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Golosa, the son of Gradsky came out on blind auditions.
Then I don't have to take my son to my own team.
He said, "Come on, get out of here, you understand."
Aguin can't do as a professional.

In Russia we're going to get fines for failure to build.
From tomorrow in Russia, we're going to get fines for downs and downs the channel of Russia 24.
The punishment threatens companies and officials if they do not transmit the building of the house to the Common Housing Information System on time.
The innovation will help those who have decided to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of a builder's bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for the construction industry.

The scientist spoke of a possible scientific programme for the RF expedition to the Moon.
The head of the Institute for Space Research of an R.D., a correspondent member of Ar Anatoly Petrucović, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working to develop such activities.
“Consolidated opinions are not yet available”, the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option was the placement of a low frequency radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope could be deployed to explore space-based sources of radio radiation," added Petrucović.
He also believed that the Louna could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be called upon to search the Earth's satellite by primitive organiscists, who consider it to be a scientist.
This could help determine how life is coming on planets.
Previously, the head of Roscosmos said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation could carry out a pilot flight to the Moon by 2030.

There were fecals and urine in the basket that Simms “separated” from the nearby mobile biota.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the hotel.
He was imprisoned and released on bail at $3,300.
He was charged with illegal interference with other property and criminal offences and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.

United States declared a possible maritime blockade for Russia
The United States could, if necessary, set up a Russian maritime blockade to prevent its energy supplies to the countries of the Middle East.
That is what Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, said.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pitcairn, the head of government stated that for the Russian economy, the only source of income was the sale of energy and Moscow was an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, Washington Examiner writes.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar to that of Iran.
The Minister believes that there are two options for its decision: military and economic developments.
He would prefer not to use the first one, so he needed to put pressure on Iran’s energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it hurt a lot.
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it hurt a lot.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Grand Prince of Russia.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I was between two cars that immediately hit me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He's been in a very bad position.
He's stuck in the traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us set out for the pit stop, we would get to the clear air, and the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus fought with his partner, he was in contact with him too.
I understand he's a little wrong.
We found ourselves in this situation at the most sloppy season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, honestly.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA, "New things."
Remember that Sirotkin, in a race at the Grand D.C., was at 18 p.m., the winner was the British pilot of the Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton.
Tarsignev referred to the absurd suspension of Ghuvova and Trenko from the foundation of Spartak
The President of the Russian tennis Federation (FTR) Shamel Tarpischev commented on the removal of the Moscovian Spartak footballers Denis Ghuvova and Andreya Trenko from the training with the substantive composition after the lazik, of the chief coach of Massimo Carrera team, reports "Sport Weekend".
The actions of Carrera were completely absurd.
Such things to pay attention is pure stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera does.
It only deepens the team's gap.
First, it's poems, it's possible to read and perceive them as much as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it in the place of Carrera.
Everyone's got a point.
Secondly, everyone wants to be cool.
If Ghukov and Zinco are gonna put down swearing, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And that doesn't serve a normal climate on the team.
Today Spartak doesn't have a game, so it didn't have to blow up at all.
Maybe I should have laughed at it together.
Spartak has a lot out of order in different lines, and there's a little bit of inequality after it's introduced into young people.
"The relationship inside the team seems to not add optimism to this match," I'm sure Tarpiszzew.
The two team game will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terri, who had previously refused Spartacus, led a youth team called Chelsea.
Syriaus teachers discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
A lecture from the Syrius Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, was given to scientists at the National Research Centre of the Curchatow Institute.
The presentation of researchers was made through the Global International Forum of Convergence and Natural Technology, organized in Sochi, on instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin, on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Cod Kurchatova”, at which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a correspondent member of Iran, Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The doctor's published on Cyrius's website.
School students learned that modern technology needs enormous amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such amounts.
According to the Forum organizers, this problem will help the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for natural technology development and highlighted the risks that such technologies inevitably pose.
"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a tremendous benefit.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second party.
The development of natural technologies is, in fact, a technological reproduction of living systems.
There's a wrong side - deliberate intervention in human activity.
There's always risks.
There was a car coming in, people were dying under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of the technologies immediately.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction,” quote a scientist in REN TW.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the audience.
The Speaker was a candidate for physico-mathematics science, the head of the NBIC-natural technology complex, INC "Curchatow Institute", Yulia Djakova, and the head of the Kurtovian NBIXS-technology complex, Vivicheslav Demin.
The Syrius Educational Center in Sochi has been set up by an educational foundation entitled “Talant and Success”, based on the Olympic Infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational centre is to identify, develop and continue professional support for the children who are gifted.
Previously in September, it was reported that the prizers of the All-Russia Online Olympics on information security will be sent to Ciberishov for training in Syrius.

The Russian submarine Kazan scared the United States
The main danger to the United States fleet is the Russian submarine Kazan.
That's what American counter-admiral Dave Johnson said, and he's transmitting "Rosbalt" with a reference to The National Interest.
"We are threatened by a severe potential enemy.

According to the U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Navy in Europe, James Fogg, Russia, focused on the modernization of its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: the referendum was not due to low appearance
The referendum was called upon to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as “Northern Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The change in name led the former Yugoslav Republic to the opening of the road in NATO and later in the EU.
But, as EFE reported, only 34 per cent of the appearance on the Sunday plebiscite “did not reach ” the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative in nature, it might be decided that the Skopje authorities would not refuse to change their names.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, a supporter of a change in the name of the Republic, stated that if more “yes” were to be cast out of the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the unattained quorum.

Kemerachian loathed a flock of rams in the graveyard
On September 30, a well-known social networking site in Kemlars reported from an eyewitness that one of the local graveyards was free to entertain the horned animals.
The animals had a small herd between the hailstones and the grass.
Commentators were of a different opinion: one of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of cattle in the graveyard, and their appetite could even help clean up the territory from the weeds and grass, but some of the city’s inhabitants did not have to take heart:
"It's graves, not pastures.
There's nothing to do with the rams.
The rams, of course, do not say that they coveted, but this is not the case."
In one way or another, one witness noted that the problem of animal cemeterys was already known and action would soon be taken.
To get around and get around is how right?
There is no word that has to be poured out.
That's right.
The word “twice, influence, influence” has only the phonetic meaning, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “bow”.
We use that word when we think it's coming from the word "pression."
But the "pressure" and the "spent" are not only closely related, but in a sense even contrary.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Longer (church, old age) means, "Satisfy, full, enough, sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
To live with, to enjoy, is a kind of saying.
He used to have a meaning that “is independent of anything, self-responsible” is“ to be longed for”.
Old Slavic "dwell" is the word "beauti" and "volunt".
I can't believe it, it's different.
In these words, the real progenitors are the daos - wolf, deija - die, and daviid - to “encourage”.
Similar phonetic appearances of the words “suffering” and “dwelling”, as well as the immediate fatigue of the latter, forced them to join in the tagification.
That's how we get this "d", which is also used in writing through "a", which is, in fact, wrong and impossible in terms of how these words arise and develops.
Well, it's good to get around.
But that word is out of date, in its proper meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the pressure display, but remember, it's the Office.

"Who, today have you had the chance to fight for the field?
How well did the car behave?"

But our car's behavior has proved to be the best since the weekend began."
You didn't give up at Sebastian Fatell's pace, but you didn't get any sense of failure.
What is the reason?"
"My attempt was a good one, but then one of the Mercedes' persecutors came forward.
He was preparing for an attempt and still missed me, but I think I've lost it for a while.
But it doesn't really have much to do with the outcome."
"It's really hard for Sochi to go around and start the race is going to be a key moment?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how things work out.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car is a markedly slow Mercedes.

Volunteers work here along with rescue workers.
One of them tells us that he helped to save three people and heard the voices of those to whom he had not yet reached: “We tried to encourage them so that they would not become downhearted, though they were trapped, between life and death.

Miracles do happen in our lives!
One of them was told in Twitter by a German journalist, Christie Dick.

And one morning, a nice sticker came up with a picture of a green bicycle and I said, "Only for him."
Mom and baby had no limit.

"This is the world we need."
The readers asked the journalist if she could still find out who the author of the idea was to tell us about it.

With the help of a Syrian operation, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In three years, about 100,000 terrorists were killed in the Russian military operation in Syria, of which 85,000 were killed by the air-space forces of the Russian Federation.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the launching of the Russian military operation in Syria by former head of the WCC, Vice-President of the Federation Council for Defence and Security, Victor Bondaved.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air pollution tools: Air-space forces have been and continue to strike precisely at terrorist targets.

With the help of Russian aircraft, the Jihadist Defense Force was haehadists -- it became a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, transmitting Interfax.

At the beginning of the Operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IH, prohibited in Russia) and Jebhat-an-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).

It is only a person recorded, not considering those who have not been identified, who has emphasized Bondaev.
Most of them have been trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have granted them the right to enter our country freely.
So, according to Bondaev, in Syria Russia is struggling with international terrorism on the far side -- otherwise, the evil would be "to reach us."

The head of the Syrian MID, Walid Mulalm, accused the United States and their partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
[West] The coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rakka, destroying infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted by its actions, it carried out mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.

The Head of IED also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete and that the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria from an illegal foreign presence and priority to the reconstruction of the country would be given to Syrian partners.

The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal lives.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life more difficult for people and their means of livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds for that purpose.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union have refused to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen admitted his full guilt of "diselgete" in January 2017.

The cost of the concession is estimated at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes more than fines and compensations.

Volkswagen is trying to compensate for damages and return the confidence of clients.
For example, the Prince's management has recently been replaced by a major restructuring and a major change in the management system.
In fact, Volkswagen has promised to buy even new cars if German cities ban on dozes on their streets: this right was granted by the authorities in February this year.

The hereditary Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman Al-Saud, had gone to another country for the first time since he took office as a Kronprit.
That's what RIA's "News" reports, referring to the Royal Office.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev’s decision to change the UOC’s name to Fascists
The Head of the Synod Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow patriarchate to Fascist actions against the Jews.
"It's like, in Fascist Germany, in a Jew, to put on a yellow acute star, that is to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill was created," said the Mitropolitan on television 24 (Interfax Cit.)
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control over the UPC and “to put it out of the law,” holds the minister.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they're patriotics of their country," he added.
It has become known that members of the Supreme Council are pleased to implement Bills No. 4128 (to change the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (to special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (to change the name of religious organizations).
The latter would be re-named CCP of the Moscow Patrarchate.
Porchaev's successor called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The successor to the St. Usperian Pachau of the Mitropolitan Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
His statement to the Ukrainian Orthodox believers on the Sabbath is published on the home page.
At different times, the history of our predecessors and relatives by faith and spirit required Christians to practice their faith and protect their holy ones.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats that are spreading, we can see that we too will have to survive,” said Mitropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The local laurea also stressed that it is likely that “your physical presence will be like”.
The priest added: "Linna's eyes are by the spirit, and they are in danger of destruction, and we shall guard our sanctuary."
To those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochavian la la laurea, Orthodox Ukrainian and world sanctuary, they must be prepared to defend it, and they must be treated.
Mithropolit urged us not to go astray from those who led the believers.
The UPC has a canonical status as determined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Mothers of the Church.
Now someone wants to be dependent on the news patriarch and the other Catholic pope of Rome’s Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us in the Orthodox world.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the laurel's successor.
He recalled that OCP had been canonical since October 1990 and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
What else do we need to do?' said the Metropolitan Dominius Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask questions, are there other Tomos faiths, and are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believed were somehow dealt with and determined what kind of temple they were going to go to.
However, someone wants to resuscitate enmity and strife.
"Some people have to wait for the dome to sit on the temples they want to destroy," emphasized the priest.
The Polish lavre is the largest temple complex and a monastery in Western Ukraine.
There was a lavre on the top of the Pachau Mountains, 70 miles [70 km] from Ternopol.
Its first historical record relates to the beginning of the 13th century.

Another sad post at Instagram called the subscribers
The singer and television broadcaster Olga Bozo can't survive the "predation" of Evgenia Nazarov, who preferred money and left the project.
The world’s tree has published another sad post in Instagram, as it has made its subscribers angry.
"Never thought there might be a price to feel.
"The life of me continues to teach me... and when I'm going to start talking about people," Buzza wrote.
Many fans have reacted negatively to such a post and have noted that, in fact, the singer “has not seen the real harvest”.
"You haven't suffered yet.
You stick to every word, you live in a normal, normal family," wrote @naalama37.
There were those who advised Busov to approach psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Can you read the psychology literature?
What do you have to do to avoid self-reproaching the victim?" I wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were some who supported the singer.
"Ola, don't be upset.
Your man will not speak loud words all over the country, and then just don't do them," he supported Bozzo @arina_prestyle.
"You're the queen and you need a king, and the one who traded you on the papers is just he doesn't deserve you.
Put your nose up and move on," wrote @kresentia_f.
Nazarov had previously explained his decision to take 2 million roubles and to abandon Bozzov because the singers had no sympathy for him.
All the money he wanted to send for charity.
If we keep playing right too, the winners are coming.
Chief trainer of Moscow 'Dinamo' Vladimir Vorobyev, about the hit by Avtomobiista (0:1) at KHL regular championship.
"The best game was, it was interesting, although she was going to the bare end," reads Vorobier's official website, "A motorist."
"It's very easy to play.
The first period was very much enjoyed.
We haven't used some good moments.
In the second period, the rival gave us a little help, we stood there.
But we got rid of a little bit of it.
The kids were playing great, they were running a coach's office.
I think if we keep playing the right thing too, the winners will come.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, the automotive has added more than the Lower Novgorod meeting?"
"Then no foreign link was played.
There were other tasks to be done at the pre-session team, playing a lot of young boys.
I think there was a completely different game, another game of hockey.
The automotive is a good team.
It's understandable on the tour table that the team plays right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good thief.
It was hard, we prepared.
They knew that the team went without injury, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

U.S. makes opium production grow in Afghanistan
On 26 September, much was spoken of in Tehran by a sharp increase in the situation in Afghanistan.
Multilateral consultations were held between Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, as represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrezov.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants waged a genuine terrorist war against State authorities and the civilian population.
The current year has been a record year of blood attacks, killing thousands of ordinary Afghans,” according to Patresov.
The woes of Afghanistan began far from yesterday.
Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) who had settled in Afghanistan.
It wasn't a month before America and NATO Allies started a military operation called Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
A multi-million American contingent and now on Afghan land.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are trapped for the fences of tens of their bases.
As they may be, they're being paid off from the fighters for money, unless they're touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls the smaller part of the country, which is 40 per cent, according to Patzureev.
50 per cent of the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
A further 10% is the ISIS terrorist (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-Halifite in Central Asia, exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine.
It is also acceptable that the production of drugs (occupants) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times in the 17 years of the United States presence.
A huge increase in land, with opium poppy, and multimilliard gains.
The Macedonians are prepared to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long-term negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, considering such a name as an attempt at a single-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “The blessing of this agreement of Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will guarantee the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises and cannot spare everyone entirely.”
The name of the country is the ruling social-democracy, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chismanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zawev, is being imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I'm going to lose my sovereignty.
There are clearly countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Doulgeri, Euronews: The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that will be made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole.”
