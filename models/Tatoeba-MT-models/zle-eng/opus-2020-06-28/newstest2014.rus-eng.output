Two men committed suicide in Kenya and the region
Previously, one of the hangmans had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1 a.m., a man born in Lugova village, in 1947, committed suicide because of hanging.
It is known that earlier he had tried suicide.
What made a man so unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, living in Kisma, died at his place of residence.
No evidence of violent death was found, reports the Ministry's press service "Kineshman" to the MoU.
A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a scattered road system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that is carefully fixed on your car's instrument panel.
These devices, which track each motorized mile and convey that information to the officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the obsolete American road finance system undertaken by the planning authorities in Washington and State.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena suddenly gave rise to intense debate and colorful alliances.
The Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the Government the right to use small testicles to track the number of miles you have traveled, and perhaps even where you are going, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
It's a shock movement.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues about private life.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree or continue, several states are not going to wait.
They reflect on how the system of driver pay for every mile of the road they travel can be moved over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have satellite tracking functions.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“It is not a question on which we can have the right to choose”, said Hassan Irata, Executive Director of the Association of Southern California Government, who is preparing plans to start tracking the States of miles passed by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, funded by taxes paid by Americans on the vehicle.
Americans don't buy as many gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles pergal.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallons, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase tax on even one cent at high fuel prices.
“The tax on petrol simply cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
It recently installed 500 monitoring devices on vehicles to test the payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long run”, he said.
The divers call it a false user's card.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since taxes will change the nature of travel to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning authorities in California are taking care of this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state ' s ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Bill Schuster (punisher, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber ' s Transport Committee, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The leaders of the Reason Free Market Fund are also delighted to have drivers pay for every mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go to the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a mistaken payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often travel miles per day to get to work or to town.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are recruited to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mile away instead of a tax on gasoline.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it's under consideration.
It will be tested on a limited basis with freight vehicles.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 Eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can carry out these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track each step.
“The concern about a big brother and such things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, coordinator of strategy and efficiency management in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were well under way, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, large-scale technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of the day-to-day movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states in which difficult search for low - cost technology is being undertaken to enable state authorities to keep track of the miles passing by, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Han said society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Myage.
This company was originally not involved in the state tax collection.
It sought to enter the developing market for a type of roadside, where drivers are paid on the basis of a run.
But the devices she tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this unless you track their speed and track their position,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of the True Bible.
Some of these State pilot programs were very wrong.
There are far less expensive and less compelling ways to do this.
In Orgon, projectors experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee on the average number of miles that all the state residents travel.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of an alert public, making devices more and less possible.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also take account of greenhouse counters, provide “pays as you drive” insurance and collect real-time data pools from other drivers who motorists could use to avoid gaps.
“Mobilists will engage in the benefit they will offer,” states the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all mispayments are simply a huge distraction.
In the city’s Gulf of San Francisco Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could only overcome the bankruptcy of a trust fund for the construction of highways by taxing gasoline.
An additional lump sum or annual tax could be applied to hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not use many gasolines to pay their fair share.
“No need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the law and social relations commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a standby plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia has taken any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with IMF on credit stand-by, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from IMF, Ukraine could obtain Euro610 million from the European Union itself.
The reviewers interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences about funding conditions.
It does not believe in the possibility of aid reforms and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating on Friday by one step to B from B.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the financial support plan for the EU, there is a reserve option for Ukraine to obtain gas, which is now the dominant part of its supply from Russia.
Maybe it's a gas from the "Northern Flow" or reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in which Russia is “insolved” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks, and that it is likely that it will reduce supplies to other regions.
“My EU and Ukrainian countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes”, added Reuters' source.
Russia Is Not a Engineer’s Fight Against Urban Pollution
Efforts to address the transport problems of major cities have been made in most megapolises around the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a general rule, it was about either the development and expansion of roads or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
Singapore is well known for its example of strict quotas for private car growth and its acquisition rights are purchased from auctions.
His price may be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have been paid to enter the city center.
In Germany, for example, so-called green areas are introduced in Hamburg and Stutgart, where only cars with a certain ecoclass also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” with a total value of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
According to the Co-Chair of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing, the main objective of the five-year-old is to reduce the lead air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, increase in private cars to no greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and an increase of not more than 5 per cent in fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, road transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the limitation of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for the owners.
Among other things, the urban green five-year-old measures include an accelerated shift to Eurofuels, the introduction of a local system of ecostandards and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars in the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed vehicles).
Road innovation in Beijing also includes a ban on all private vehicles within the fifth transport ring (all in the HLR capital, their six), one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number), and the issuance of registration plates for lottery-based vehicles (e.g. 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only one third of the 2010 figure).
According to the current government programme on environmental protection 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (208).
According to the Ministry of Environment, in 2011, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere occurred.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars ten times higher than industrial ones, and in St. Petersburg nine times.
The FI is still just beginning to think about the possibilities for restrictive regulation of cars on city streets.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the WTE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are obviously unpopular and can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car fleet, where there are two classrooms that are not sensitive to any regulatory effects - both official and personal cars, as well as those of "hand" users whose total number is not less than 200,000 (about 5% of the total number of cars in Moscow).
On the other day, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study on the urban balance between housing, road cover and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are: the city centre is provided twice as much by roads as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them long in parks or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking, but a storage of cars, but to reduce the carriageway (to make streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to restrict the use and accommodation of personal transport at the borders of the security zone of the historic centre (generally around 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Securitys for unauthorized private trade in Vuldo will grow up on a different scale
According to the urban authorities, an increase in fines would help to bring order to the Vlorde and free the streets from the natural tents and the lotus.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, their products often do not have adequate sanitation controls.
That means wet health is at stake.
Thus, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade from November will be sixfold - from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reports the press service of the Vlorda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of underpaid consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of that growth.
In recent times, it has been totally due to consumption, which has almost done little wrong,” stated Russian chief economist Clemens Graze, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of an investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now, the nominal salary growth in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the cost-effectiveness of Russian companies is falling, so they're likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, GDP by only 2%, then we explain to Mr. Count.
Companies have experienced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it may lead to dismissal and an increase in unemployment.
Not to raise the wages of Russian business, comments chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantüsin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure staff members, or to retain current ones, employers have to raise their salaries.
The consumption in Russia has been reaped by a very rapid increase in consumption.
In the view of Mr. Grare, this type of credit does not, owing to the extremely high consumer rates, have a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy.
“The benefits for the economy from growing consumption have not been seen, the money goes through the economy, but return to the same banks as interest payments,” said the economist.
But the problem in another is that Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in the delay on unskilled loans.
They are taken mainly by the poor, who have nothing to do with security.
Interest on these loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently," Mr. Grade noted.
The second risk of economic growth in Russia, therefore, is a possible crisis of insolvent loans.
The Director of the WSE Banking Institute, Vassily Sweet, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to low-cost resources, such as those available to the public, have been forced to attract funds to the population at high rates.
In response, the government's offices went on the pathway of war and started lowering the credit rates, the economists continued.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans for the same percentages, otherwise they will have a negative interest rate.
If the government offices do not abandon the demping, Russia is in danger of a full banking crisis, considering Vasili Sweet.
The deprivation of licences by a number of banks in recent weeks has been regarded by economists as a sign of mass collapse.
“It will not be possible for the government to manage this situation: the investment insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institution.
But consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, because of the refusal to index the salaries of public servants and the military as laid down in the current budget version.
A partial impact on consumption will be reduced by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, lower inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not grow (and is not yet available - see the paper), consumption growth will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Panclayin of Barclays Capital has yet to see the prerequisites for pessimistic scenarios.
"Guard risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that the Russian economy would begin to decline at less than $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise interest.
This may mean they didn't believe the CB that announced a transition to inflation rigging,” said Clemens Graffer.
The cent policy of the Centre for Market Rates has no effect on the rates of interbank lending.
"To CB it's the collapse of all hopes," according to Clemens Graffer.
The CB auction money is not used by banks to manage the economy but rather to manage their liquidity
Once the rate declines, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to escape into speculation against rubies.
“It is or later the CB will realize that this strategy is not operational”, said Mr. Grade, and recalled that it would be allowed to fly in “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it will have to do this before, or raise the CB key rate (5.5%), he considers it to be.
He estimates that the rubles course is now artificially overstated by 10%.
Only one road is weak, makes an expert's conclusion.
But if the CB leaves the financialists with a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to reduce the rouble, it might break the rouble much stronger.
The second convention of the peoples of Southern Ural was held in Chelalbinsk.
The Forum is devoted to People ' s Unity Day, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian Statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious faiths, legislative and executive bodies, participated in the Congress, with a total of some 350 persons.
The forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-national harmony.
We can show an example not only to other regions but to other countries as well.
We have no misunderstandings or disagreements.
We live in full understanding," claims Faofan, Mitropolitan Chelabinsky and Zlattowski.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the upbringing of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
Following the Congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of the Czech National Cultural Unions was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “work” with Germany on the subject of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence director, said that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about his activities.
A German deputy, Hans-Christian Streebele, met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snouden, a deputy representing the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “As the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not offer any protection.”
Yet, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to withdraw criminal charges against him.
The charges against the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Freedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was listening to the telephone of Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy head of a parliamentary group in charge of the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snouden as a witness, “it must be used without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States entirely”.
Mr. Streebele, a member of Parliament from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have been in need of assurance that he would be there “safe”, said the representative.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the world's response to “his political remarks”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — have found the unsupervised system of comprehensive surveillance to be of benefit to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontline Airlines will charge for manual storage
Frontline Airlines plans to take up to $100 from passengers for hand-taping their flight.
Frontline Airlines plans to charge up to $100 per hand and $2 for coffee or gas treatment, although their announcement on Wednesdays stated that passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new handbag fees cover the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags below the seat will remain free.
Frontline said he'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers were paid only on landing.
Frantier Kate O'Melli said that a $100 fee should make passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it, ” she said.
The airlines started charging the first and second luggage bag in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges gain as much as they can in hand-trips, which often lack space in these compartments.
Collections are one way to make passengers walk less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really for making money.
The point is that the most loyal clients of the Frontline claim that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger who is waiting on the Flyr flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at the Frontier Registration Parks is meant to guarantee that passengers will know about the fee before they land.
The new Frontier collection for manual storage will not start on until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to indicate that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not involve hand-cooking fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual laying fee three years ago, and another disk player, Allegiant Air, followed her example later.
The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, a airline consultant named Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, the hand-tray fee is worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew by the Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find on landing when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
“The landing procedure was the smoothest of what I saw in the airlines for my career, ” he said.
I was expecting to see the gnashing of my teeth and the emergence of a landing fight.
The plane was captured, he said, “and the landing was fast”.
The Frontline also follows the Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, gas, or juice.
Frontline stated that passengers who receive gas or juice could keep the whole bank and that coffee doses would be provided free of charge.
She's still going to distribute water free of charge.
U.S. Airways tried to charge drinks for a short time in 2008, but refused it seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airlines followed suit.
The Frantier Manual Feeding Initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is the latest way to get customers to their website.
The airlines pay out-of-office tickets like Orbitz, $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to the tourism online agency.
However, Frontline went beyond everything else in this area.
In September, she began to give twice as much money to frequent passenger customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut down its captivated number to 25 per cent of the miles.
So, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontline, acquired from an online travel agency, would have made it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly from the Frontline site.
Frantier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is declining and becoming lost.
The yield declined by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic's trying to correct Frontline's finance as part of the sales of airlines.
NSA blames internal error rather than hackers on their termination of site
On Friday evening, the Occupyed National Security Agency announced that the termination of their site for a few hours had caused a technical malfunction rather than hackers, as alleged on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available within hours of tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planned renewal,” reported the intelligence agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that the failure to work was caused by a distributed attack of a type of service denial [DDoS] are incorrect.
Previously this evening, the online server monitoring system registered that the NSA did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still not available to some users.
The representative of the NSA had previously told ABC News that the domestic secret network of the “not” agency had been hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative informed the representative.
At least one online group of hacker activists stated that it was responsible for withdrawing the NSA site from DDoS-like activities.
DDoS has been designed to cover the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is abandoned.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secretariat NSA, once known as the “No such Agency”, has found itself in recent months at the centre of public attention and intense criticism following a series of revelations of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and inside the country, all of this reaction to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former staff member, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to the suggestion that today's incident has been the result of targeted hackers.
The arrival of the Bamboardier is reduced with the fall of supplies and the number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier, Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to a reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Board also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeers aircraft in Montreal, nor did it provide new information on whether the ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft have been completed by the next September.
After the first flight of a trial sample of an aircraft about one and a half months ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether a schedule test was taking place.
The results did not support projections and resulted in a decline of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from “over-the-medium” to “medium” because of the conviction that growth in shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the number of aircraft delivered has been generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the profits of the Transport Division,” said Dorksen in the stock market review.
We believe that the Bamboardier will get new orders on the Sears as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CServies aircraft family will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first pilot sample of the aircraft was submitted in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, there are still very few CSeers ’ firm orders — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight tests to verify the company ' s fuel efficiency and potential economy of a new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Bodohan, was confident that the Bamboardier would reach its goal of 300 hard orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
“The plane’s test model did not remain on the ground longer than expected, ” said Bodoan during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates had been planned for a simple flight.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take the update break, so we did.
This will occur throughout the entire flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to take flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow it, as reported by the company.
Still, analysts sceptically refer to the claim that the first client would be able to operate CSeers 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the period of entry into service and provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flying tests - although it seems to be in keeping with the institutional schedule of Bambarier - reinforces our view that the introduction into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorkensen.
In the third quarter ending on 30 September, the net income of Bamboardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents, last year.
The adjusted share has remained the same — nine cents.
Gross revenue decreased slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
The analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross revenue of $4,46 billion, according to Timson Reuters I/B/E/S.
A fourth aircraft producer worldwide reported that it had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, a decrease from the previous year to 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Office's airspace portfolio was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“In the air space area, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were an unacceptable factor,” said Bodoan.
Gross revenues on the airspace front fell by 13 per cent — to $2 billion.
Bamboardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector rose by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport portfolio was $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The incomes of the transport unit have had a negative impact on the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bibardier shares, which also announced that the chief finance director of Google Patrick Pichet would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent, to C$4.83 in bids in midsummer.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of returns for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s results in the period from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, as a result of the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony TV business, in the second quarter of the company that delivered the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially because of the reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find solutions to the difficult situation, Sony continues to concentrate on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporations, has recently placed emphasis on industrial kits: the company’s sales here is growing at a high rate, especially through road systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects 179 billion yen to have an operational return against the expected 230 billion yen.
However, according to Themson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher and would be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from a Japanese corporation with a number of fancy functions was announced, allowing for 100 times a day to get a smartphone out of its pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and return forecast, the shares of the company in the morning at the opening of the Tokyo roads lost more than 11 per cent, falling to 1668 yen for one action.
He's become a synapse-educator.
Scientists at the John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that enables the Foxp2 Document to function by stimulating the creation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and a summary of its contents can be found on the magazine’s website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of families from several individuals who were unable to speak correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists have found that family members have been hampered by the work of the Foxp2 gene, but the way it performs its function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function as Foxp2 acts as a stimulants for the formation of new synapses in the field of speech-making.
He's doing this because of another gene, STPX2.
The latter was found by the search for factors that stimulate synapses education.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with a Foxp2 showing only that it is active.
That SPX2 does have a real effect on the violation, scientists have confirmed in a muscle experiment.
When the gene’s activity was artificially reduced, they cried less when separated from their mother.
If the gene’s activity was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was restored.
Previously, mice had also been linked to the exorcisation of Foxp2 itself.
The animals who were injected with a human genome were fed more actively and at a lower rate than the normal mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, therefore, of SSRPX2 are linked to purely "mechanical" characteristics of the production of sound or thinner processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the criminal group leader of police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neil Carbarboro
Counsel feared that his secret drug dependence would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A senior lawyer who told the drug baron about a large police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his clandestine drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Bashat Ditta transmitted to the criminal authority of Neil Skarboro secret information on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after he had been threatened by cocaine dependence.
A lawyer who received the name of Bash and who was summoned by a " cool lawyer" from the criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police check-up for Skarborough, which he represented earlier in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that the 32-year-old Scarboro had left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County Lancashire while he was at the dinner of a bar association with colleagues.
The investigation found that Gitta “regularly used” drugs at class A after the tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two persons on behalf of Skarboro, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Kambri, Mercisade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 persons were later imprisoned after the police had seized heroin and cocaine in a series of quantities of > 1.5 million and more than 200,000 cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta transmitted information to criminals because of fear that he would be exposed to cocaine dependence.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, which works with the legal company Forbes Strategics, located in Blackburn, was disgraced after recognizing his guilt in two cases of deliberate interference in the administration of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He admitted to storage of cocaine in one of the previous trials.
The trial of a lawyer followed the investigation of the Skarboro police, finding that he had been talking regularly to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him going to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting the drugs at 60 per cent purity in a golf glove in a lawyer's garbage box.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarboro convened many times with Ditta, who was at the football stadium of Ivan Park, Blackburn Rowers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations were held between them.
The court learned that Gitta had “regularly used” cocaine after the tests had discovered the drugs of class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
The child was later arrested but denied the use of cocaine, said that he was talking to a suspect dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was “advocat secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to throw out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At the police interrogation, he said that he had a house office, along with a place of work, and the clients came to him home in legal matters.
However, it became known to the court that, after important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that detectives knew them.
Ann White, in the indictment, said: “If anyone knows that he should not violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer in criminal matters, as he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who gives drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be valid, as he was their lawyer.
This, however, has largely crossed the limits of the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He has prevented the police investigation from as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not feel for his profession but disgraced her.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly the Skarborough, and had allowed him to doubt his uninterest.
It was not guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done so without delay.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holsted of the police in Lancashire stated: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to purchase drugs from organized crime”.
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the principal criminals who charged him with providing valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and give the community confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into the case of Mr. Ditta led the Lancashire unit on particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for criminals.
Let the matter serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted 14 years after his confession of guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons who had participated in the manipulation had been sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
During his website, Ditta organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers in which he says that his dream work is a lawyer representing the American death penalty clients, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work is inequality.
The stadium in Jaroslav was not ready for 22,000 spectators, noted police officers who were present at the CDDC meeting today.
The flight programme is overstated, they think, twice.
During the match, 1/16 of the Final Book of Russia, with Spartacom, involved only a thousand podiums under a regular rule of nine thousand.
The Spartakovian fans had 2,200 seats, or 10 percent of the size of the stadium, but in agreement with the Moscow Club, they sold 5,000 tickets.
This information was read by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigianz.
The Americans listened to high - ranking officials in Japan
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the American Special Forces who chose not to disclose his name stated that the United States had listened to the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials in Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several points in the rising sun for audition.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was true during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Like Germany, despite allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, Japan is the object of exploration, reports the NHK television channel.
This information has officially not yet been commented on by either side.
Remember the news about the U.S. Special Forces monitoring the Chancellor of the FRG last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone over the past 10 years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some data, received a very painful report about his audition.
She stated that the allies she believed were the FRG and the United States for decades, such monitoring of the Head of Government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details of Angel Merkel's phone calls with members of the German Prosecutor's Office.
The German made a special trip to Moscow to meet with a former CIA official.
The bacilli can put the grain on the market before the beginning of 2014
During government procurement interventions, bacilli can produce grain at the bidding stage not earlier than early 2014, the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nicholas Covalenko considers it to be the Minister of Agriculture of the Covalico Republic.
To date market prices are such that they do not encourage sale to the intervention fund.
So far, the price of the market is higher, and there's demand.
He said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the 2013 crop crop was 3.1 million ha in the current year, including 1.7 million ha in crops, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
The harvest in 2014 is 550,000 ha (a total of 105,000 ha) more than in 2012.
The area under the osemble of wheat and triplicals has been increased, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There is no “Bratian Community” group in the U.S. base that Leps have assigned to
In the databases of Russian forces of the "Brat Circle" group, which Washington assigned to a singer named Grygoria Leps, is not meant to be.
Interfax noted that since the media reported having introduced the United States Department of Finance, Grygoria Leps on the watchlists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate of the "Brat" community, all databases have been verified, but no such group has been found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russia Mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, in power structures.
"In fact, in the very name it's called 'Bratie circle', there's some kind of mystery, there's a hint on the secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a pyar act," said the agency's interlocutor.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that it was suspected of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate, Arthur Badalian, the Grigories of Lepsveridze, Vadima Lälin, Sergei Moskalenko, James Ribal and Igor Schlakov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of being associated with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and who have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Grigroy Leps “serves a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontieva”.
Lepsa, a producer of Grygoria, refused to comment on U.S. charges against a singer, calling them a "breed."
In 2011, US President Barack Obama identified the “Brata round” as “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and directed the miniphin to “spoil and suppress their global criminal operations”.
Making a person black on U.S. mines would block his assets in the United States and prohibit business contacts with persons living in the States.
Scan video hit the police
The chapter of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and lewd outputs, was attacked by the smoking of the creek.
Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to initiate an investigation against the town manager.
He said he wouldn't leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police website.
Bill Blacker, the head of local law enforcement, held a press conference on this matter.
Sheriff said he was not authorized to share the figures with the public, but for their existence he was handcuffed.
According to Blar, Rob Ford’s composite video was found during an anti-narcotic raid carried out by the guards around the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press had written about the video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself did not comment on this.
He's just saying he's innocent and he's not gonna quit.
The police recorded video is one of the evidence in the case of the 35-year-old second-year-old Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illicit income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lizi acted as Rob Ford's driver.
City residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought with journalists on many occasions, appeared in a drunk audience, allowing himself to be racist and sexist.
The Rostoreinves OO recognized the German company Assmann Bureaun + Planen as the winner of the tender on the choice of the genetic designer of the facility.
They don't reveal the contract in Rostowereinves.
According to the OAA press services, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under the conditions of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to a hospital expert in the spring of 2014.
The winner has to design a new passenger terminal for the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and facilities for the improvement of the airport complex.
During the first phase of the construction of the terminal, it would be possible to increase the inside area of 50,000 square metres.
According to Roostoreinves, the project document will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and 6 million passengers by 2035.
By the time of conclusion of the tender, the architectural concept of the “Souther” aerospace complex developed by the British company Twelve Architects had been defined.
The project of the main terminal is the idea of an air bridge between Rosovna Don and other cities around the world.
Assmann Bureaun + Planen has experience with major projects, design terminals C and E of Sheremetevo International Airport and a new aerospace complex at Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the region of Brazil and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and integrated into the urban construction in the future.
The construction of the aerospace complex is scheduled to begin in 2014 and the installation of all facilities is expected to take place in 2017.
A political leader in Turkey announced a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of the separation wall in the district of Nusaybin in south-east Turkey.
The local residents and members of the PMD Party in Prakard were strongly opposed to construction.
The mayor on the border with Syria of the Turkish town of Nusaibin Aiché Hekhan announced a hunger strike protest against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reporting to RIA News in the Press Service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have launched protests on several occasions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Muammer Güler, initially refuted the construction and then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Aiche Hekhan, a member of the PMD, announced a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," stated the party's press service.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries and that the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is a inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," quote Aiché Hekhan from the party's representatives.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to be held in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will establish the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - a boliar - relative to the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg informed the agency of the Government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians acquired in the country at the time of departure.
A specific amount of boliar relative to the dollar will be determined at a later rate.
In February, Caracas was forced to devaluation the local currency to 6.3 boliar per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 boliars.
Since the beginning of the year, the warlord has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
In September, the inflation rate in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
On 18 October, Rafael Ramirez, Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of Economics, stated that Venezuela had no plans to decal the warlord.
According to informal information provided by the Agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the exchange rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing the prices of products and products of broad consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a lack of a number of products and the operation of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmach, Director of South Africa, noted that it is still difficult to say how long it takes to find a new chief coach.
This office became vacant after the resignation of Sergey Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it takes to find a new coach, I'm not ready to, brings Belmach's word to ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all the options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
Not just finding some coach, but someone who works in our club for a few years and gets some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“It is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask, ‘What can the independence of the judiciary be prevented by Parliament in the future?’ ” said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This is a very harsh and punitive law, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio and news site.
He said that the new judiciary on the media “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government”, and restrictions on content and advertising will affect Kenya's global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will in effect enable the Government to “take the media back dead,” while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have “received a serious blow” and expanded the bill as “draconian”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media have caused the wrath of the authorities by broadcasting security cameras, where the troops who were sent to the site are suspected to rob the road shopping centre.
The response of David Kimayo police chief of Police was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan schillings, and individual journalists may be up to one million, with an additional risk of being “discretioned from the lists”, i.e., a ban on official journalism accreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily National, “more than one fine is sufficient to paralyse the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “resilient blogosphere”.
Politicians realize that when they silence the media, they will be able to do their best without impunity.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote journalist National Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrents and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will break the country and return us to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were the target of anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the lifting of the cuts appointed by the National Wage Commission and the restoration of their enormous salary of about 53,000 shillings per month, which are not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure, the cost of the major maintenance of the house, will arise in the utility payments to the enemy.
The most approximate estimate for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will be to pay between 100 and 400 roubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the drive, bring up the ladder cells, or even replace the elevators, the occupants will decide.
This law has been approved by the members of the District Duma.
Vladimir Condnikov, President of the Voronze Regional Duma, said: "There is also a need to set order for the re-establishment of homes, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often have registered in Moscow, and in Orenburg, somewhere else, to establish State control over the spending of funds that gather residents to repair multi-family houses."
Now, under the control of the State, the construction of equity.
The law protecting the fraud has been approved by the final reading.
The document was not born empty.
In our region, 45,000 people have been affected by unfair developers.
Most people's problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law sets out the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction work.
Vladimir Condnikov, president of the Voronze District Duma, said, "It's not a secret that there have also been abuses in this area, because, in the 98s, the same percentages were caught, and in the 2000s, the same percentages."
People started making money to cover up the loopholes, including the two laws.
Under Voronjej, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The ruling Parliament has passed such legislation not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problems of illegal migrants in the region, however, should be taken away.
Thus, in the past year, almost over 100,000 foreigners have entered migration records.
But only 1 in 5 has officially issued a work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes, it's a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, president of the Voronze District Duma, said, "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and deportation must be done somewhere to keep them.
Such a decision was made by the Federation that, from regional funds, such sites would be equipped.
In the Voroneg region, this is the Old Olshanka of Semiluk.
Well, finally, the regional parliament granted new benefits to large-scale parents.
First, families that raise five or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget then loses 3.5 million — but it also saves large parents.
Secondly, and above all, those who adopt the 3rd and the younger will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family of six, for example, are pope, mother, child and 3 adopted children.
For them, the State acquires a dwelling of 108 square metres, over 3 million roubles.
For the left bank or the South-West Microaeon, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the city center for that amount.
Baumgertner is nominated to the Board of Directors of Urallia.
The current Board of Directors of the OAA, Ukalclay, offered a candidate for a member of the Board, who had been arrested in Minsk by Gentor Vladislav Baumgertner, on the Russian company's website.
Butteranter entered the list of 11 people who had been nominated for the new board of directors.
The list has been prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, at which a new composition of the Board of Directors will be determined by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
During his detention in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges of Baumgertner were re-classified as “housing”.
Matt Dalton's military refused to comment on Vladimir Crykunov's departure from the post of junior mentor.
Holquiper believes that Dmitry Balmeen, the Acting Chief Training Officer, has great authority over the players and will cope with his responsibilities.
Remember, Krykunov's resignation was sent today by Nafthechmick.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Crecunova, quote Dalton RIA, "News."
I can only say that Dimitry Balmin will meet his obligations - I am not doubting that.
There's a lot of authority on the team, and this young man is definitely waiting for a great future.
Leonard Bonuchi's defender will not help the team in the nearest Italian championship with Parma.
According to Fotball Illia, the training headquarters decided not to include him in the application for a game to save before the game of the 4th round of the League champions with Reloom.
Neither will they take part in a party with Parama Lichtsteiner, Teaching and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Cvalyarella has recovered from trauma and is ready to play.
The fuel travel will result in a tax manoeuvre, which involves increasing the oil-producing tax (NPRI) along with lower export duties and excise.
In the view of the experts, these measures could bring additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyar Court stole the certificate and hit it on the head.
The unknowns attacked Vladimir D twoeconco, president of the Krasnoyar District Court, after stealing his certificate.
According to Interfax, late at Wednesday night, the perpetrators hit a judge on the head, where he lost consciousness.

The criminals didn't take money and other values.
The two of us went home alone, and the police returned the next day.
An investigation into the crime and the search for the perpetrators is under way.
Zenita's fans on the official site of the club recognized Russia's ex-quest collection team as the best player in the past month.

In Ivanov, the Interregional Exposition “Mediocin and Health” opened
The inter-regional exhibition “Medicine and Health 2013” was launched at the Olympic Sport and Education complex.
The first Vice-President of the Government of the Ivanov region, Olga Haslouttov, participated in the commemoration.
The exhibition presents the work of the provincial budgetary health institutions of the Ivanov region, as well as the commercial treatment institutions of the Central Russia regions.
The exhibition will include seminars, round tables, presentations.

U.S. Secretary of State: Special Service sometimes went too far to collect data
The U.S. secretary of State, John Kerry, admitted that in data collection and audition, the U.S. intelligence services sometimes went too far, but the politician noted that the media record of the audition of 70 million people did not match reality.
I assure you that innocent people have not been hurt during this process, but the attempt to collect information has been made.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unjust.
I recognize this, as the President also recognizes, and we will ensure that it does not happen in the future,” quote Secretary of State AFP.
Italian interns take the road to young
Italian unemployment beats record.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population were now unemployed.
That was not the case since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of people aged 15-24 years have no employment.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
The largest energy company in the country is already carrying out such an operation, and the laws adopted enable the regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for employees with seniority.
Italy, on the other hand, is facing the general problem of the ageing population in Europe.
And economists are not sure that the difficulty with the premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
The result of the construction of TNC in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport locomotive units.
Until 2020, 155 TNCs are planned to be installed.
What the project really was, our correspondent was involved.
A couple of months ago, an Arbatsco-Posto-Plogian subway came into existence.
The post said it was going to be set up by the transport trans-shipment unit.
All of this was very strange, since no ground transportation is stopped near Smolneska and therefore it is not possible to move on.
In order to reach the nearest Trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to cross about 130 metres, including the ground crossing through the Karmazi alley.
It's almost over in Smolenska now.
There was a color lacquer, a newspaper stand was dismantled, and asphalt was replaced by a raffle.
There's the whole transport knot.
The transport hubs are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the capital Department of Transport.
No capital TNCs yet.
The flats include the construction of parks, the withdrawal of trading facilities that impede passenger traffic, small architectural forms, and improvements.
In fact, flat TNCs are not even engaged by transporters, but by professional comforters from the Ministry of Capital Masters in Moscow.
The transport department is not necessarily complex, explains Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the High School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs above your head and a plate to report the time of arrival.
This is, for example, Yasenevo's metro recently opened a full-fledged flat transplant.
Without hangings, let him take over the parking lot and sign the bus when the bus arrives.
But in the race for numbers, officials write down everything in the TNC.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build on all 151 knots, of which 59 had capital construction.
Now, there are some 255 TNCs in plans until 2020.
One and a half of them promise to give up this year.
Although the city has a TNC development programme, there are no qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization Cities and Transport, notes.
Counted out by number of sites, the quality of transplanting in each facility is often deteriorating.
The criteria should be two in the view of the expert: first, a reduction in transplant time; second, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without rain.
In Moscow, however, TNC sometimes turns out exactly the other way around.
A bright example of the WNX Metro.
Previously, suburban buses from the Jaroslav highway came in the Square before the main entrance to the VIC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on the street of Cosmonauts.
Far away from the metro, far beyond the liels, but closer to the residential houses.
For good reason, the residents did not want a car station under the windows and complained at all possible facilities.
Capital TNCs in Moscow didn't ask for anything at once.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Metro of Planerna.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And actually, this is a sample of how a resecutive plant, which is given to investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.
No, it's got buses on the ground, a curtain to keep the metro from raining, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the Kymkin Trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TNC did not give room in principle.
They were like strangers moving away from the subway.
But there is more to the trade.
There's only 32 stores of clothing, and there's almost everything from the zoovards to the autosalone.
Well, which of the passengers in the bus would have to get a new car on the road?
We have, when the capital TNC is being built, so we always have a shopping mall.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot decided to give up the market.
The war trade is now on the third floor of the TNC, which is marked on the floor of the parking spaces.
Defenses, spices, Chinese jeans, neo-Russia speech and guards who look viciously at our photographer.
The transplant was finally turned into a market.
The thing is, I used to have the Plasterna Metro, but they took it down.
And the dealers in the prefecture were paid for and put in the replanting parking lot.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty there.
The funnyst thing about the market was to build a new flat TNC in its place.
That's the rocking.
On the Kalovaski Metro, the distance from the subway to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping mall, TNC is said to have increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping mall.
After 22 hours of closure, it must be covered in the open sky.
However, the structure on Plasterna and Calova will soon be flowers.
In mid-September, the Mayor ' s Urban and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TNCs.
Four of them would be 25-foot, not counting as two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow into the Tushino Metro, and it will have 418.7 thousand square metres square.
The authorities of the RWD railway station responsible for the construction of the TNC at the subway have already told journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be scattered in the future.
At the same time, officials will ensure that multi-European parking parks take from one third to one half of the area.
Take "people's" garages for example.
Let's say a garage of 258 machinery, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars in Pterrovsko-Razamowski, you're going to need about 80,000 quasars.
It's less than a third of the stuff that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to every bus baron.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
This one, just for a minute, almost two GU Ma.
If capital TNCs are built by railway stations and railway stations, the remaining areas will be used by the Metropolitanists.
They also promised that there would be a lot of “functional” objects, including hotels, offices and even sports stations.
By the way, in the Department of Property of the City of Moscow, journalists were recently informed that a draft order was being prepared to allow investors to seek a site for TNC officials directly.
No competition.
Because let's say transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TNC is, for example, Garvard Station in Boston or Eastan in Toronto, and I'm sure Alexander Morozov is.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend to the ground at the metro level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 30 feet [50 m] off the street.
There's no excess trade around.
But Moscow officials are throwing themselves into extremes.
Or we'll build nothing, or we'll break 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes that extremism be compared to an insult to patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of the patriarchal feelings of citizens against Russia, the provocations and insults of “Equitable Russia” suggest that the insults of patriarchal feelings be compared to extremist activities and that they be punished for five years in prison.
As reported in the newspaper “Investigation”, such amendments to the legislation prepared by Oleg Mikev ' s Energy Committee have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriarchal feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship of the individual with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, which is responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Micah, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal State authority, flag and herb.
At the same time, in the view of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be asked and insultd by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, has not been sufficiently worked out in Russian law.
As an example, he cites annual discussions on the Day of Victory when some media speakers have questioned the heroic feat of the USSR people in their struggle against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the Day of Victory, 9 May, is the year before the real vacation.
In the face of acute confusion and “alternative eye” in history, some public figures are in the way of reasoning that, to deject, what a pity it is that the cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I think it is totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritually strong” nation, Oleg Mikheev is outraged.
Furthermore, according to Michael, patrioticly minded people in Russia are far more than religious people, but the law also punishs those who believe and insults patriotic feelings with little or no impunity.
In the opinion of the People's Elect, it is necessary to equate the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to describe in the 282nd article of the Penal Code the appropriate penalties.
The bill provides for penalties for insults to patriarchal feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 to a fine of 5 years ' imprisonment.
The magnetic earthquake of 6.6 took place on Thursday, 31 October, in the district of Koquimbo in central Chile, and was transmitted by Reuters.
There was an earthquake in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 km and a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as specified at the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The plates were recorded at 8:03 local time (3:03 1 November Moscow).
Victims or damage caused by underground destruction have yet to be reported.
It is recalled that Chile is in one of the most earthquake-based parts of the Earth, so there are no rare earthquakes.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, an earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami caused the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile was the most powerful earthquake in recent history: 9.5 in 1960, it was recorded there.
The disaster killed more than 5,000 people.
Dominica Medvedev: The Greenpece case will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitriy Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpece activists would be considered in strict compliance with Russian law.
France may be certain that the case will be handled in compliance with the law, and we hear all concerns.
“We can guarantee respect for the law”, stated Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Greenpece is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizzan, like the other activists, is charged with bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero, RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one can violate the law”, stated Dmitri Medvedev.
He said that any structures that were trying to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “as powdered barrels” and recalled what took place in the Gulf of Mexico passed on to RIA News.
UN Declaration of New Objectives for Poverty Eradication
The United Nations must immediately begin to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of the Goals for Sustainable Development to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the outcome document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit on the eve of the evening that the time had come to “stand above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and oversee the process of establishing the universal goals of sustainable development, CSD”, he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by the member countries to translate our vision into sustainable development goals that are building on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top-down statue of Samara Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan slogans for peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
As she looked forward to her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with "We Require Security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital Square of Independence.
During two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were received — one of the most brutal clashes since the end of the armistice was over 20 years ago.
Once a prominent rebel movement, supported first by the White authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
Following the 1992 Truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country will again resort to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have caused foreign investors and local residents to become insolvent.
The rates are high for the fast-growing economy, since the opening of huge shelf stocks of gas and coal fields in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party, the leader of the political power since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of the tension that has been created.
Renamo Party claims that the Government has been the trigger of recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional Renamo district, on 17 October.
The attacks against former rebels were then aggravated when government forces attacked Renemo bases and attempted to kill Athonso Dkhlakamu, a leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times of Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Ghebuza tried to dispel the fear of instability.
Gébuzza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dkhlakova felt like a “skiller” who wanted to use “all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelim and Reenamo insist on trying to avoid war.
However, fear had increased following the reported rejection by Renemo of the 1992 Peace Agreement by Mazanga.
He informed the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo Party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness, ” said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties had done little to ease the tension that had intensified the series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Geboza and Dkhlama) who have been met with foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are a good negotiator, nor are they prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to weaken the movement to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the Government.
The vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), founded by the former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Ghebusa, who had to leave his post next year when his second term was to be completed, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” said Mazanga.
It is unclear what Renemo is capable of, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and motor vehicles on a key highway from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala Province, several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but included Bairo, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June, Reio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was turned down when asked if Renemo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the Government ' s grievances, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future, and must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Soultuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"They just want peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
A series of Al-Mainstrite Pre-Presidial Filmcasts will take place in Moscow
A series of art shows to the Art Mains, where the audience will be able to see one Russian film and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will take place at the "Rolan" cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the RAA "News" with reference to the project organizers.
Open the Art-Mainstrima program with the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerić's "Parge of All Costs".
This is the story of the Maye (Sam Carechi) model in the French capital, which, due to visa problems, is deported to Morocco.
In addition to Kerić's film, the audience will also present a new picture of the famous South Korean film director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", the melodramat bead of Oliver Hirschbihel "Diana: A History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the leading role and the main film of the May Cannna Film Festival "Jining Adel" by Abdaltif Kesha.
The only Russian participant in Art Mainstrom will be the winner of Alexander Weldson's "Geography Globe" film on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's one-name novel.
The main role -- the awesome failure-of-trainer of Victor Plukina -- was played by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the prize of Kinotrov.
Children must study myths and legends as “life models”, says the author.
The reports of the Torah could show that the “flexible power cannot defeat a subtle trick” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths would be “big wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscenities for teaching in schools”, Crossley-Holland favours age-appropriate selection.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into a 20-year training program.
He added that the “extraordinary moralization” of authors and teachers “debates interest” among children, and the main ideas are “comparable” in fascinating history.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beovalf from the English-Saxon language, also wrote the Norwegian Myofs Collection for Penguin and the British People's Tale, said, "You can certainly have intentions, but you'd better keep them with you."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that there must be a congenital understanding of good and bad.
And it must be sublime; it's revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show it, not tell me.
A football fan in the Voroneg region was detained, breaking a window at the station waiting for the train station.
At nine o'clock on 29 October, two football fans from Moscow province were removed from the passenger train at the Grzy-Bornegow station.
After playing a favorite team, the guys set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were taken to the police station on duty at Grazi to prepare a protocol on administrative violations.
There fans repented of their antisocial behaviour.
The police laid administrative records on them and let them go.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for his arrival at the station station.
In the first half of the night, fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, came back suddenly and broke the window at the station's waiting room.
The call of the broken glass was made by a transport police officer and a PKKR guard.
They were able to deter the evil-doers who tried to escape the scene.
The employees of the South-East LIWR of Russia are subject to an inspection.
A criminal case has been initiated, and the senior representative of South-East Russian Ministry ' s information and public relations has reported on the transport of Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaliy Mutko?
I think we've been back 15 years.
The Minister of Sport, Vitali Mutko, expressed his opinion on the riots at the rostrum during the Russian Cuban "Sinnik" match.
I'm in favour of sports organizers, clubs, leagues, FSF.
But we can see they've taken a bad stand.
They're waiting for someone to come and take care of it.
That's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We need to organize sick people, clubs have to invite their pimps, not get the case on their own.
We have now drawn up a special government decree on rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it is accepted, we will take up this problem very well.
But I still have to invite all the football organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, let's get the law moving.
It feels like these Bavaria sick people came to Jaroslavl and did all of this.
We are outside observers.
And it's terrible to see the podium floating out of the firewall.
And that's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snowmans Can Interrogate Russia
American intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in the case of telephone negotiations by Chancellor Angel Merkel of Germany.
As Interfax said on Friday, a source familiar with the situation could answer questions from the German genealogy in writing or directly in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit outside Russia is practically impossible.
“In that case he would lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by the U.S. allies,” said the agency's interlocutor.
“In principle, the FWG's gene-procurement could send representatives to the Federation or transmit written questions to Snowden”, added the source, adding that the issue should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Previously, a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Schrebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify on the case by the U.S. Chancellor's Offices for the negotiations.
Snowman is ready to testify to German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The CIA's ex-worker has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite U.S. NSA blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, to do so, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined," said the Strebel television channel Euronews.
Snoudden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source Interfax, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how to decide.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, followed by the publication of information about the U.S. Special Service's secret surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities, which had submitted serious charges and had remained in the Sheremetevo transit zone prior to August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a year and then left Shemretiev on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had been working at a "big Russian company."
The German media reported last week about the NSA's link to Angel Merkel.
According to journalists, U.S. Chancellor’s telephone calls began to be heard back in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing the information, said that Merkel's surveillance violated Germany's laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
The State Duma ' s deputation from the Fair Russia Party, a member of its Newosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarv, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the party's Newbir regional office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the “presidence”.
We're sitting there drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomavre puts on a partlet," but that's nothing of an age," commented the deputy.
Ponomarv noted that good relations with the regional office of "Esmers".
In the meantime, the mandate of Deputy Gosduma Ilya Ponoav is not intended to give up.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and was not allowed to leave the party by law.
Reports of the intention of Ili Ponomariev to leave the Fair Russia Party appeared on 30 October.
Demitry Goodkov and Valery Zubov were reported to be with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of Japanese MID Fumio Kisida met the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“Wishing to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, stated at the meeting of Kisira.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, had visited Russia, relations between countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the FF would meet Japan in complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the question of disputed northern Territories.
To this end, Tokyo is protesting the return of the lost land since the Second World War.
The Japanese capital rides cars, from which the loudspeaker gets the word, "The North Territories".
The police do not stop the protestors, they ensure that noise levels are not exceeded.
BEN Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New York
It can be boldly argued that New York is the birthplace of the standing room in America: almost a hundred years ago, the Nazi artist Frank Fey, who worked as a confederacy at Palce Theatre Theatre in Broadway, began to talk jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fea's new experience has over time picked up others, most recently New York City's comedy festival.
Caroline Hörsch, the founder of the Caroline stand-up club, celebrates this year ' s tenth anniversary, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these hadhliners started in Carolines, and then more successful, reached a level where they were already too famous to speak at the club,” said Hörsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes presentations by Vandy Sykes, Katy Griffen and Bill Mara, as well as the Standard for Heroes, an annual music and medical philanthropic concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where there will be a meeting of other Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Kosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comets participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, with a show on small TV channels like Comy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was known for playing a handicraft show on a small-known cable channel (it's like a Liga scab on FXX on the subject of fentesis futball) and now he's running his own screen show on Comdy Central.
Jenny Sleit entered the actor both on the live air tonight and in the Paraques and the Recreation Zone, although she is best known for a series of viruses called Marzel - a cancer in shoes.
Both Croll and Slade, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, a wicked, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized American comedy.
One of the most vivid moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started off as a stand-by, but then he became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal history of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a leading TV Land show called St Down Company with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Tower Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry’s work, ” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks around a place between two houses and thinks, "That's why, if I stay completely without money, maybe I'm going to live here."
The Pakistan authorities started negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistan authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy in Great Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Naviz Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during the meeting with British Vice-President Nick Klego, with which he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement of the Pakistan Embassy in London.
He said that he hoped and prayed that the dialogue should work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” the diplomats added.
Pakistan Taliban (Tehrik-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the single-name Afghan movement, but they operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistan Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Islamabad Government had previously tried to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would be possible to negotiate only if the authorities were to withdraw to the permanent deployment sites of troops stationed in the Taliban-based areas and to be educated from the prisons of arrested Islamists.
Naviz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.
The oil fell into the price of $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks were overshadowed by reports indicating that China ' s energy production sector was gaining strength.
The U.S. crude oil class in December was 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel at the later morning at European time in electronic commerce on the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was cheaper by 39 cents, which was a 5.8 per cent drop in the price for October.
Rich oil stocks have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, reserves increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging from two reports of the Chinese industry that had demonstrated a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery could continue to gain strength after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after 20 years of minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, also used by U.S. refineries, cost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The chief trainer, Patrick Rua, explained the decision to release Simeon Warlamov, from the first minute of his Friday match with “Dalsa”, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not break his confidence in the Russians, passing on from Dallas to Natalia Schmelev.
And what we're waiting for,' said Rua after the morning break "Lavin."
Of course, the worry we all face, but we're sure of it and feel that it's good for him to come out to the ice today.
We want him to go out to the ice and show him his usual level.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't affect the larator's air conditioning?
I'll see you tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varly by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in earlier matches of that season.
Basically, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until this situation is resolved.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia. The warm tomato won't replace the soup.
Why Vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found a correspondent in RIA News.
People who have totally abandoned animal products must not live in Siberia.
Here they are not moved by winter without a loss of health, and no thermal tomatoes compensate for them, considering the previously interviewed Vegan Day as a newcomer’s diet and doctors.
Drink Oil Litres
Strict vegetarianism, when abandoned not only by meat and fish but also by milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, diathetologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, diet strict standards are at least inadequate for health.
Total rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animals contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for.
We need to include milk or eggs in the diet at least," a certain nutritionist named Marina Godi.
It gives an example of a fish containing an irreplaceable fatty acid of Omega-3.
His richest oil is linen.
"It takes litres to drink to need needed amounts for a person!" says a nutritionist.
Medical personnel are confident that Siberians should pay particular attention to the diet during the winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
High demands for food have been placed in our realities.
To keep warm, you need increased calories.
"If man is limiting himself by animal products, he does not get the calories accordingly," says a specialist.
That's what Dr. Olga Podek's doctor agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits aren't going to come out.
It is best for a person to eat mainly of food that has been grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
Genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in winter, people don't want to cook, but a hot soup, or something more greasy,' explains the doctor.
According to her, various grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries are truly useful from what may be available.
But that is certainly not enough for proper nutrition.
According to master physician Claudius Arifulin, the vetythin levels within the body are sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when temperature can change by 30 degrees a day and snow into my snow is not appropriate.
Organism needs energy, and that's fat in the first place," notes the medical profession.
Doctors note that vagaries are particularly harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including in the form of amino acids.
By being vegetarian, we give them incomplete.
It also requires increased protein, vitamins and micronutrient content in the menu.
"They're missing the giants," I'm sure of God.
Arifulin says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play the toys he wants."
He's already got a built-in organism, a skeleton, an organ.
And still children should eat well.
If his parents deprive him of some microelment or amino acids, picking for him what he eats, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"The shortage of certain substances for brain development, vision, bone won't be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals interviewed agree in the opinion of the low quality of winters produced in warm and intruding vegetables and fruits.
The fact that we are brought in and grown in heat contains a smaller number of micronutrients that we need than (bred) in open ground.
"The quality of the food is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and thermal vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
In some cases, producers ’ desire to collect more crops is detrimental to their quality.
“Fools don't become brown on the cut, gobbles are quick yellow, punctuate, tomatoes are unsavory and non-aeromatal”, gives examples of medicine adding that they're likely to have too many fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cages.
This is not the case with the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics, a candidate for science in Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in the greenhouses, full vegetables could be grown.
If you try to remove more than a square metre, of course, you will get more and more water and reflame plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow fast, they're big but watery and very small," she adds, adding that the issue of quality is primarily a matter of conscience on the part of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the enforcement of the decision on the practice of “intention-and-seeing” in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the New York Police Department's “restrict and Search” programme and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal of the Second Circuit stated that the execution of Judge Shire Sheindlin's judgements would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city was in violation of the Constitution in connection with a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city lodged an appeal against its decision and regulations on remedial measures, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police office change its practices and related training programmes.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because she had violated the U.S. judges ' code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, using the programme “result-and-see” against blacks and Latin Americans.
It appointed an external controller to oversee major changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York had decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been discontinued after the police inspection.
Deliberations on the city's appeal are due after 14 March 2014.
The “restrict and search” tactic was criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
The Residual Search has been in some form for several decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of which are black and Latino.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
The New York Department of Police says that these changes will put an end to harmful practices, will form a more reliable and effective police service and may influence the way other police departments implement this practice.
The opponents argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money transfers and do not address the more global problem of complex police conditions by reducing the number of officers by a few thousand in the past decade.
The judge noted that she had continued the practice of “restrict-and-seeing”, which was in conformity with the Constitution, but was changing the way in which the New York Police had left people.
Pedestrian zone opened in the Third-Clae Gallery area
Moscow has a new pedestrian area.
It is located in the area of the Third Galeria and takes two kilometres from the Metro of Novocuzsk to Boloty Square.
Street bags, flowers, benches, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been set up all over the world.
In addition to the Clementovsky and Lavsurinian alleys, which were already pedestrians, five Ordinian streets were closed for vehicles, the Grand and Small Talmachs, the Kadashevian Coastal Square, and the Bolin Square.
There is no restrictions on the movement of transport on Mariosek and Petrovka streets.
Newsmsk.com has been given to pedestrians at the Fifth Street Station from the Nvokuzsk lobby to Clement Portal.
Within the pedestrian zone, there was a third-year gallery, the temple of Clement’s clergyman, Pope’s Museum, Museum, Library, Memorial, and other attractions.
Previously, entire pedestrians had been the Tverska Passage, the Bells, and the Kuznets Street.
A large Demetrivka, where the footway opened in early September, was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson nailed a broken phone to verify confidential communications
A former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “the breaking of the phone, tracking and countering” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, which was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Queen's lawyer Andrew Edies, informed the Al-Bayley court that in May 2005 the News of the World had received a false message that Clark was meeting with his "recking Special Adviser", Hanna Polbie.
The newspaper told the private detective Glenn Mulkeyer to break the Polby's voice mail and watch her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, heard the court.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coleson, who is currently editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will be standing outside someone's house, hoping to get someone in the middle, he's the person who loves to offer a story to people to see what they're going to say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World had used three methods of investigating stories: telephone hacking, surveillance and counterattack.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently he knows about the second one, about the tracking, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the breakup of the phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!
Clark's novel rumor for the first time drew attention to the renderings of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The tape, with voice messages received at least three times from her phone, was removed from Mukleir's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private detective computer in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as “projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, her grandmother and grandpa, Ms. Polby, received anonymous calls requesting information on her, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turkbek and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's traffic tracking.
Having left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coleson said, "I have a story we are planning to publish tomorrow that I would really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Ediz said that Coulson's participation in this story took place in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as David Blancett, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about an affair with a married woman while he himself had met with Rebek Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny entering into contact with other people in order to break up telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mukwier, Turkbek and Wezerap confessed to breaking up their phones.
Snowden states that he is willing to contact the FWG authorities in the audit case
CIA ex-worker Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the FRG, passing on RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented to the German authorities by Deputy Bundestag Hans-Cristian Schrebele, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Sherebel was dating Snowuden in Moscow on the eve of the day.
Four people were injured by a fire on the Tver Street
Four passersby were injured as a result of an fire in a colloqui in the centre of Moscow, on the street of Tver.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passovers were damaged during the fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News, with reference to the head of the Labour and Energy Department of Paul Levin, the power supply has now been completely restored in all houses on the street of Tver Street.
Fire in the heat box outside the house of 15 on the Tver Street took place in the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the river sewer hatches and a smoke occurred in the underground crossing at the Armiya store.
11 houses in the Tver Street were destroyed as a result of the fire.
At 9:45 a.m. in Moscow, fire was removed.
US$ cut the food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, there has been a decline in the financial security of food plates known as “feds” since the relevant State programme was concluded.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than before by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, one person ' s allowance was an average of $133 per month.
The cost of food aid in the United States increased to $80 billion per year owing to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans have relied on free food aid from “fedstims”, which has been known as paper coupons since previous years.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress require further reductions in funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
The owners of food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
US Congressmen continue to argue as much as possible to reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free
Blizzard's 1994 platform was released free of charge on the PC.
WW Insider reports on this.
According to his data, the game became available at Batlee.net in the class game section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers have pointed out that only users whose shares are of the United States services can now jump it.
The game is not yet available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not appear to be different from the original version of the game.
Sundtrek to Blackthorn also remained unchanged.
Blackthorn, a platform that Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally arrived at SNES consoles.
His events took place on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarla decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the world.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending to earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to meet Sarlaca ' s men and protect the inhabitants of the world from them.
The original Blackthorn became the first game that the studio released after its name at Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorn was a company called Interplay.
The Moscow Metro will have new assault rifles.

The first equipment will be installed at the "Surveying" station on 8 November 2013.
The presentation of new ticket sports will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Jokow, and the Olympic Champions of the Alexei Nemov and Elena Zadzcíkov.
The National Security Agency's recognitions are enhanced by paranoia of corporations with regard to State surveillance
A warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
Under instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Services, its task was to photograph the roof of the US Mission Building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to detect antennas of listening devices, which led to negotiations between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Klapper, Director of the U.S. National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use external intelligence “to steal commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profit.”
However, since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who became a exposer, began publishing his treasure secrets to U.S. intelligence, European Governments and company leaders were no longer sure whether they could believe the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained access to data stored by suppliers of U.S. cloud services, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paralytic corporations caused by the State's surveillance to new heights.
The last thing came to light that Chancellor Angel Merkel’s telephone was listening, perhaps for about ten years.
If Europe’s most influential personage can become a target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made clear the intensive cooperation between United States intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI, representing the small and medium-sized IT companies of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now represents almost the same risk as China's in the area of industrial spying and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
All documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, have yet to show that the US has transmitted commercial secrets to its own companies.
Policy was concerned that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business is sceptical about it.
Someone in German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Platner, president of the German software company for the SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
It's all subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
Yet, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spying agencies known as Snowtown was a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China was the greatest risk of surveillance.
There is a big shift in cloud technology where leaders of European companies are better aware that the data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by Cloud Security Aliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of non-American participants have refused to use U.S.A.W.W.A. ' s pro-passer service following the disclosure of an American programme for intellectual data analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneib, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that has not arisen a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically within this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are merely a confirmation that they have already known: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What is happening in economic spying is not surprising.
He's always been there.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Director of the BASF Chemical Company.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we are also spying on them, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as it may give the advantage to the enemy.
In large companies, the idea has long been realized that taking a free flash on exhibition or leaving a laptop without being seen in a hotel room is at least unsupervised.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the vehicle company Audi, said that it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the meetings of the board so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas visits because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The paid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders of the world market in their particular lows.
“small and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns BfV.
The United States warns its own companies about economic spying by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France with Russia and Israel in a second set of hacking agents for economic exploration after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic spying, “the Francis are worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Department of Internal Intelligence, DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The officials know that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young man from Georgia who died in an "unseen accident" believe that his son was murdered
The parents of a youth from Georgia whose body was found inside an abandoned sports mother in his secondary school gym, believed that their son was murdered, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the town of Waldost State of Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical standing mat tied back to the podium at his secondary school gymnasium.
The Loondes County sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family challenges this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” said Fox News.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, physics and common sense,” said Krump.
They think it's a cover for protecting the man or the people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to their dead body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
The Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll learn all the facts, wherever they bring them.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I hold that there is sufficient ground” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial opening showed that Johnson died as a result of positional asphyxiation.
However, the second discovery, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues that should be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct him.
The Loundes County sheriff ' s representative was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video recordings of observation cameras that the investigators had seen.
The teenage parents said that they were hoping that video recordings contained the key to locating the way he died.
“Spartacus”: For information about persons who held a fascist symbol

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control published a list of recommendations for food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of similar recommendations issued by the United States Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children had increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and support staff on food allergies among children and how to assist in the event of an allergies response.
It also recommends that schools keep the stocks of adrenaline, the most likely for injections is the automatic medical syringe EpiPen, to assist with potentially fatal anaphiliax.
State legislatures have recently revised regulations to allow schools to make stocks of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It's like something's running through my tongue," "it's like I have hair in my language" or "the tongue of a pint."
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undetermined sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor of children born with intermediate-type external sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender of such children by allowing parents to indicate gender as “undetermined” or “unestablished” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the Act was to remove pressure from parents who may be able to make hasty decisions on sex attribution operations and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to BBC, one intersexual person said many years later: “I am neither a man nor a woman”.
I'll stay the doctor's scaffolding piece with bruises and scars.
About one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological relationships, which are diagnosed with “sexual abuse”, which is a composite term for people with aetopic chromosomes, goads (hypes or seeds) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been an intern.
Gender identity is still under-examined, but most experts in the United States say that if a gender cannot be identified, it is better to use and assign all available information than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of a child before the operation, if at all.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersexual children create an ethnic dilemma.
“Some people have life- threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can add a floor without an operation and then see how the person develops.
Science about how a child has any gender identity is not too precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexuals as distinct from transsexual or transgenders, since their condition was not related to a gender but rather to their biological structure, which did not correspond exclusively to a male or female gender but was typical of either.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex features such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and bodyization; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender workers in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third sexes in their official documents.
In June, Australia's 52-year-old resident Norrie May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “unsolved” to stand before the courts for the maintenance of “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on Channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with German law, stating that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where the floor is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two other pillars of civilization”.
A newborn mother from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer children to have sex at birth.
“To have a child is difficult and without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born to men and women’s sex organs were called hermafrodites — named after the beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived the gene as a letter on which to keep everything and then to draw it again.
But now many have challenged the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, without knowing how a child will perceive the sex he has been given when he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called an urgent psychiatric accident, ” said Dresher.
When these children were born, you called not a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of the University of Jones Hopkins, who felt that the gene could easily be changed.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents grow up — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case, 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He suggested that the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during negligence, fully castrated the child, also removed his eggs, and raised him as a girl.
“ Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn’t the case, ” said Dresher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “using this model” now.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these sex-changed operations declared themselves “unsatisfied”.
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer in Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes, but intermediate-type geniuses.
The doctors could not determine whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he would never be able to live a full-fledged life by a man.
So shortly after he was born in 1976, Bruce’s external sex organ and eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
They gave him female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABC News.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned a weight plate.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, getting a testosterone shot, and removing his breast.
The operation made it barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexual characteristics.
But Ann Tear-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Law Association Advocates for the Formed Kingdom, is concerned that German law “encourages for labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child a “undetermined gender”, she said.
We're afraid he'll promote intervention.
We believe it's best to have a male or a female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will show itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Kohrer-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose for a third sex”.
“Encourage people should be able to make their own decisions on formal sex”, she said.
German law implies her attribution at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a mammologian from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Baráz’s daughter, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called “the syndrome of Total Imprisonability to the Dorgens”.
Because of the poor performance of her pharmacist receptors, Cathy has developed a woman’s mark.
She's got a burden, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovarians.
At the age of 29, Katy is married and is in charge of child psychiatry at Pennsylvania University.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or Gestapo surrogate motherhood.
“ The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” Baraz said.
It gives them time to do some analyses and to deal with situations, as well as time periods before they write “male” or “women”.
Then you grow a child in order, and you love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel happy.
We don't have to rush through an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that parents are driving because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing, ” she said.
Eventually, the child will decide what kind of sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Nikolai Habibulin's army has emphasized that he realizes that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russianman, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six pieces of Tampa Bay and then four of the Otavas, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth missing chess.
We have to play well, and I haven't done this in the last two games, and it brings back the words of Habbulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think we should approach them as games, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You've got to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that you've had.
There are a few little components that I need to improve, but I feel like I'm good at training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything becomes a snowball.
Maybe I need a little relax.
The gatekeepers - I don't think I'm alone - always trying to run a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
Doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on me so I don't miss so much chess.
It's great that my classmates support, but it's actually simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't full season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened is what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try and play next match better.
There was a bus on Altae.
In the Rubtska region of Altais, an PAZ flight bus was turned over.
According to the figures, 13 people were injured and reported to the regional office of the MES.

According to the department, the accident took place about 9 a.m. local time on the Nolonkaevka - Visvica road, one mile [1 km] from Nolonkolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus, all injured in various degrees of gravity and hospitalized from Rubstashsk to Visvica.
Eleven victims were taken to the Rubsovsk City Hospital, two of whom had been hospitalized by the Rubtashsk CRB.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects that, once established in Latin American and Asian markets, Superjet 100 aircraft will be shipped to Europe as well.
“We expect, in general, that we will receive such arrangements by more than 170 copies of fixed-wing aircraft of this type.” comes from the words of the Prime Minister of Russia, Dimitry Medvedev, who was given to them at a press conference with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro of France.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be put in France," emphasized the Russian Prime.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Sohogo's Garda aircraft in partnership with Aleania Aermacchi.
A Lyer is based on modern technology and offers high quality and comfort standards in a segment of 100 passenger seats.

Baba Anja, whose home in the village of Ivanovka Petrikova, has been home to an atheist family for twenty years, has begun to observe the nest as he sits in spite of all the efforts of his inhabitants.
The birds put on top of new branches, and the lower layer is already moving between wires.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of aristocratics who've spent every year in the homes, got out and fed in the summers of three or four birds, but they don't want to stay out of sight.
As soon as the birds flew into the warm edge, Grandma Anja called the Royal Empire, which had its support.
And I didn't even expect them to react so fast.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, and told DTEC's technical director, "Dneproblenergo", Sergey Berezowski.
In fact, the wires, which were already found within a nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms [150 kg], had begun to be corrosive.
At any rate, birds could die from electric discharges.
Even local residents risked being left without light because of damage to the wires.
As a result, the line-ups began a rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithology scientists at Dnepropetro National University helped to develop a pattern for the transfer of the nest.
They did training for district network personnel.
A well-known Dedpropetorist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energy engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
It has been calculated that more than 50 alastial “headquarters” are in emergency condition.
Special metal platforms that resemble the funnel were wreathed for their reconstruction.
The foundation was wrapped in the eves and then moved there by an old nest.
According to the experts, it is sufficient to place the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the Aris will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Peschaka of the Novoskosko district.
A new iron - celled column was placed next to the power station and placed on it a platform with an old, already used nest.
The whole operation was powered in nine thousand grams.
On the other hand, on the other hand, the same newcomer was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikova in the province of Anne’s grandmother.
The platform was secured here, just above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “city” has been substantially repaired.
Up to the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pozoska and Kingishan regions of the Dnepropetral region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others have ruthlessly killed them.
On the other day, the whole area was reached with sad news, in the village of Ust-Cammenka of the Apostolic Region, the day of the pheasant hunt, and the poachers, for entertainment, shot down a swany family that was pampered on the local pond.
The noble birds were not afraid at all of the local people who fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, ran to the pond, the four swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now the members of the Apostolic Paradise Police find out who fired at the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On 4 November, on People's Unity Day, Moscow will have an agreed mayor of the Russian March.
According to the Levada Center survey, support for the Russian March is growing, with 40 per cent of the citizens agree to the idea of doing so differently.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of the citizens endorse the Russian marches differently, 11 per cent of which are definitely positive and 29 per cent are more positive.
The concept of the Russian March is gradually growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed in 2006 and more citizens (28 per cent) in December 2010.
“Surely negative” to “Ruskas” refers to only 7 per cent of Russians, 19 per cent of Russians.
An additional 35 per cent were unable to express their views on the stock.
This year, Moscow's mayor agreed to the Russian March of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of Alexei Mayor's capital.
This nationalist share has been taking place every year on People ' s Unity Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, “Did you hear that on 4 November Russian “Ruska March” was being held under the slogans of Russian rights? Three quarters (75%) of citizens replied negatively.
Only 1 in 5 Russians (20 per cent) is now aware of this.
It is noteworthy that almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the Russian Marsh in December 2010.
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural rally of nationalists was held in Manje area and turned into riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about the holiday of 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate the celebration.
About the same (17 per cent) will celebrate the October Day of the October Revolution on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the mayor of Moscow agreed "Ruska March" in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublino.
The leader of the Ruzski organization of the march, Dmitri Dymushkin, reported this to the leader.
In addition to the march in Ljublino on People's Unity Day, there will be a rally and rock concert of the Kolowrat Group, also agreed with the authorities.
As the "Russia March-2012" passed.
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists passed the sixth from the Yakyana coast to the Central House of the artist, where the rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to 20,000, and the Ministry called a figure of 6,000.
Communication: Obama election headquarters considered the expulsion of Bijden in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the immediate advisers to President Barack Obama have taken up the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with the candidate Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the clearest sensation from all the expected book of Mark Halperin and John Heilmann about the 2012 campaign, “Sats Double: The Games Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of a book that was ready to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the President's immediate assistants had conducted “a wide-ranging study in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Bijden's exception could help raise the burning hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times Jonathan Martin, political commentator, the book describes in detail the attempt by high-ranking officials of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House White House, to assess the effect of voting on the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected one at the Chicago Pre-election Headquarters and at the Oval Office.
Only six of the President's immediate advisers — including Daly, the former head of Obama Jim Messsina's pre-election headquarters and the former senior advisers to the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluffa — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Staves Double states that Dalei was the instigator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their “nearly personal relationships” but eventually refused to do so when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not “improvise Obama's considerably better chances”.
In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the Administration had really considered replacing Bijden Clinton.
“I actively spoke out for a lot of things, and it was one of them, ” said the Daily newspaper.
You must remember that at that moment the president was in a terrible shape, so we thought, "Oh my God, what do we do?"
Although Dalei described the study as “an essential test”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that pre-election headquarters had invested enough to examine whether that step would result in a vote dividend.
“The electoral headquarters does not spend such sums on surveys and focus groups if they do not take seriously,” said Martin in AK 360.
It was unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN what he had asked Daley if his team at the time knew of possible diversion.
Although Daly said he didn't think that the president had been aware of a possible replacement, the former head of administration acknowledged that Obama knew that he was “may”.
Martin added that the “Fate is doubled” does not provide a clear answer to the question as to whether the results of political sensibilities have reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he took it seriously that Obama was not aware of a study on how to remove Baiden from the electoral list.
“Possibly, ” said Martin.
Do you want a light in the dark of ice cream?
The British enterprise has created the world’s first frozen ice cream with the help of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals in order to develop a bright meal.
He came to this idea, read a science article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to re-establish a bright - looking protein.
The ice cream reacts to the tongue of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it shine.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to shine when it responds to heat, it means that the more you ski, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the Ice Me, I'm delicious, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still a very early step, if you talk about production, so you get about 2 grams for 2 grams."
The protein that we use in the morphine is reacting to your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up, it'll increase your pH level and your ice cream will start to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to present it in Halloween because it's creating such a wonderful shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times the value of gold.
So, every balloon is worth me about a hundred and forty.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Brister, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and solo gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the distortion caused by ice crystals, which consist of ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of the jellyfish made up by Chinese scientists
Avangarda Coacher Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to preparing his team for the game of the regular HLC championship against Salvat, noted that the washeds carried out a thorough analysis of the injury from the Mytallur Motig.
The specialist stressed that Avangard should focus on the game of defense.
We've been watching video games against the Metllurga magneto, bringing the official Avangard's word to Chebaturkin.
- Missed a lot of chess, not a nice moment.
We missed our mistakes because of failing to play assignments.
We knew that the rival had performers.
Well, according to statistics, there were five attacks on the move -- three chesss killed us.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
My boys and I carefully study each match, talk after the game, and prepare for the new match.
The main thing is to make the installation work.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Mellourg.
A game assignment was performed, and the score was 2:0.
I missed a needle in the locker, and in the third period, I started to make a mistake.
Given the difficulty of playing the game, there was no point in involving the defenders.
You have to fight the whole team.
Now Avangard's got a long house-circuit series, the match goes through the day - the team's tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The key now is the realization of their moments and the performance of their game assignments.
Hokkey, it's an emotional game, if you're doing an installation, everything's not that complicated.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, there have been hundreds of fours on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, native officials promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotules
Hundreds of fours had been dug at border crossings at the entrance of Russia.
This was due to changes in the customs rules for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the line creates a Russian side that has not warned in advance of innovation.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, reports the Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The document of the new model shall be applied in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Pass points are in advanced mode.
The FACTOV Correspondent went to the border and talked to the forward fighter hostages.
Prices in the road coffee shop at the Novosovsk pass point grow every day, as is the turn of the four.
Trucks stand in a number of rows, stretching about two miles [2 km].
The Novosovsk - Wesselo-Vozinica Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport lines from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From there, the goods are shipped to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, the regulations were put in place, and after they entered, the jubilator Alexei Headanev (in a photo) who is transiting the goods from Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new regulations, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and payment of insurance for the goods.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are transported.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 gramin).
Those who travel nearby, say, in Georgia, Armenia, with a cargo of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 rubles (3800) and travel.
The others are stuck, because no one has that much money with him!
Can you imagine if the driver carries the goods worth just $4,000, but right up to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles to pay for his transit?
The conditions for survival on the border - no - are scavengers who eat around their cars.
At the border stores and cafes and always expensive, but prices like here, we never met!
The salesmen focused and quickly charged them: 15 raccoon stands for the baton, 7 cup of coffee, and 25 graven soup dishes.
And the cafe's one.
And there's no toilet.
We'll go to the bathroom in the steppes.
Don't wash or shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, and I've got my wife on the road.
A week's length, another long-runner, Victor Skotrenco, is comforting.
Will I get my car in line for a week?
Why do you have about one and a half litres of water?
There's 11 and 15 riens.
What, a bottle of crystal or water is on silver?
We have a coffee, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, mates the seller.
After the media coverage, Ukrainian drivers drew attention to the plight of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosov and Novosov City Councils was commissioned to ensure that all those who were on line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with potable water were placed in line with the Acting Chairman of the Donetal Authority, Sergey Dergunov.
The ambulance crew will be on duty at the crossing.
Biotollites will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the problem of divorce will be solved in the coming days.
As of 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were rented by the Donetsk press service, respectively, at the International Enrolment and Novosovsk International Office.
FACCTES will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to brand a Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking persons of Lithuania and countries of East partnership - such a statement was made by the BNS agency in the Department of Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, Moscow is about to “speak” to the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskate, and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarachiv, which relate to facts from the curriculum of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, the Department of Public Administration Analysis of Inter-regional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Eugenius Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Congress of the People ' s Party of Lithuania.
A member of the operation is also allegedly a member of the department of V. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov visited Lithuania on a regular basis until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskate, announced that he was aware of the information she was preparing.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of Europe and “the country's vision for energy independence” was the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
In this way, it stated that the Kremlin was “unsatisfiedly respected”.
In addition, the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, was accused of applying to Lithuania “only requirements”.
Recall, in September, Roscourdest suspended the import of the Lithuanian “Milk” into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products did not conform to sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare an appeal to WTO.
In the United States, the school principal shot down young people.
The director of one American secondary school has literally led adolescents to despair.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, a man’s home was filled with toilet paper by young bullies.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on adolescents, resulting in several injuries in his leg and a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not on the property of the director, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 000.
Notice that shooting civilians in the U.S. is becoming a terrible trend.
A man literally opened fire at the centre of Rijkrest, in the United States of California, right along the street.
The criminal then took two random passersby, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to escape.
Previously, a shooting had been opened at the primary school of Newton, Connecticut.
Adam’s mother, who was a teacher, worked at the school.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people suffered: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to have candy, not to go to bed late, and arrange a mask for our area.
I'm more like a scoop now.
I haven't been summoned in the last two years to give up candy in my apartment, and I'm probably not going to be this year.
Statistics, however, show that I am a white crow in the case of Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retailers, most Americans — about 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is the trend.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will have $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
Sexually uninspired objects this year are at the peak of fashions.
Women no longer need to be members of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of sombies with Hodgs, and I'm sure the cosmonauts in the style of the Daft Punk will be on our Instagram's tape this year.
According to Google, the suits that most people look for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with traditional attitudes.
We brought our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't make fun of it.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, wells, Mike Duds confection, Twizzlers gingeries and Clark Bar's Batteries.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, these are excellent news for 41 million children who are in need who have come to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat £90 million of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn beans; nevertheless, according to the National Contesters Association, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about nine billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I've got to figure out yet.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like a ghostly house.
They have amazing names, such as Fear of the Wall (which is, by the way, in this prison), War and Cry, and House of Resurrection.
Moreover, according to the American Hauts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those dramatic photographs where you've almost described what your friend put on Facebook, and you can't get rid of, and then that guy who likes you, sees this picture, and leaves a comment like "classic expression of person."
And finally, let's talk about the tigers.
Charlie Brown introduced me to the Great Ticvo when we were children, and Jack's cut-off is like the ornament of a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a child in the tiger began only last year, thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up by cutting these pumps instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Office, this year the Americans will spend around $106 million on tobacco.
Jack's lightman, slowly blowing up on your wing, is probably coming from Illinois, which raised £542 million this year.
If you want to do things harder, visit Tim and Susan Metzidon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their pumping weights of £2032.
The site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia was restored following the attack by Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been rehabilitated after the morning cyberattack, reports the Ministry ' s press service.
According to Tymar Peterop, this was a primitive attack, the site just overloaded a lot of requests.
Our specialists quickly set up the site, so far the site has been renovated.
"The damage done to the Ministry has been mined," said Petercop of Postimes' publication.
According to Peter, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will have to examine the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
We recall that on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group placed an address on the network in which he confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leaders to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die in favour of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We're in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"The rose from Ukraine" is stated in Anonymous's statement.
Previously, Ukraine reported that the Marine Infantry Company of the Fodosius separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Infantry would participate in NATO ' s command and control exercises of the control forces Steadst Jazz-2013.
Due to the raging of the unclean force, it was necessary to close down several schools and hospitals
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Mabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked by... hoblins.
As the local elder explained, the children fell into panic, and it was not possible to continue.
Talking of goblins may sound like a child’s invention for a European, but in Africa it is a serious argument to close the school.
Adults fear unclean power, too.
In the summer, for example, the hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because the gablins were also attacked.
Announcing the Land Rover race series
Indoors are used for walking seats and six-point seat belts, as well as for internal communications systems.
Modernized brakes, a package of services to ensure access to the Bowler Worms mechanics, logistics support and storage of the car between events are also available.
Drew Bauler, director of the Bowler Motorport, said, "Lottlers who go to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced persecutors, but people looking for excitement, adventures and access to world class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult circumstances and realities of the Rilly Road.
It's a really exciting thing to be working on the Defender Challenge car -- it's really going to be a fascinating championship.
In addition, Devender Chollenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces are not aware of the "Brata Circle" group - New Isolation
It is written by INTERFAX.RU, referring to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After news reports on the introduction by the United States Department of Finance of Leps to the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurosian criminal syndicate 'Brata Community', we looked through all the databases, but we didn't find such a group," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad.
The U.S. Department of Finance, as previously written, published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group, the “Bratian Community”.
The Russian singer Grigroy Leps was also named.
He's on the list as Grisha, and he's on the eve of the day.
The figures of the popular Russian performer coincide.
The exact name given is Grigroy Lepsevirze, a creative pseudonym, a place and a date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another member of the former USSR whose nationality is not stated.
In the United States, you're sure that Grigroy Leps, who lives on Phuquet Island, was transporting money to bandits on their order.
A photograph of a singer is attached to this report and all of its data are shown that are correct.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house on Phuket.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Making a person black on the U.S. Miffina's black lists entails blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contact with persons living in the United States.
Assistant Lepse Maya Seríkova said that no notices to the singer were given: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Grigroy, which everyone is talking about right now in the U.S. scandal."
All Lops knows is news from the media.
There was no notification to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
She said that there is no real home on the Phuchet of Grygory Leps, but according to Minphine of the United States, he does have a home on the island of Thailand.
She stated that Leps was now in a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him during his flight to the town of Blazvensk.
He's out on the field at Shinnik's.
Some details have been learned about the identity of the fan who fled to the field during the match of 1/16 of the Russian Federation finale between the Lutheran Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
As President Arthur Grigrantz of the CDR stated, referring to the data from the MWD, the hospital is a Muskovic.
He's been detained at the moment.
"In addition, Grigiantz described how the fan managed to break through the field, saying, "It was clear that the one who called him the spectator had come to be assisted by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, which was confirmed to us by a doctor's ambulance.
Then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corners of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the east and North rostrum.
He ran through the whole field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Act on Sport, this zone of action of the stewards - the police are unable to intervene in what is on the ground.
He ran to the podium, crossed the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time there were riots on the Eastern rostrum and on the runway," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that the decision of the KDC of the Moscow Spartak will hold without sight the forthcoming matches of the 15th Russian championship against Lokomotomyva and Zenita, as well as a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were called to save the lost cheek, which was stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous career.
Coker-Spaniel Ruby escaped after he was on a small accident
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, she noticed a man walking out a dog.
Fired down a rope on a high slope to save a dog from an imminent loss
The pup has been fortunate enough to escape after the fire brigades have been called to raise him and deliver him to a safe place after he has somehow stuck 50 feet in a dangerous slope.
The nine-month-old Ruby Scotsel has escaped after he was hit by a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and has spent three days alone before he was rescued from his career on Wednesday.
Her hosts, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Fleppit's career in Denholm in West Yorkshireshire to reunite with Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They've been viciously looking for their missing dog and calling on social networking sites after she's escaped to a career after a small accident.
About 14:15 a.m., a star dog guide noticed Ruby standing 50 feet high on a career assignment.
The technical rescue unit from the Klexhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to raise her up.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, "She was in danger."
It was right in the middle of the spring slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move and muscle during her rescue, she's completely shut up.
But now she's okay.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog has noticed is unbelievably true.
The rescue officer, Peter Lau, said, "Raby is very lucky to have been saved."
It was likely that she might have had a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinary for inspection, and it was found that everything was in order, except for depletion and de-absorption.
Ms. Hall of the Galaxy, West Yorkshire, said, "The rescue watch was scared."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had defied and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
That was very brave — what they had done.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: “We feared it might fall, but it remained there.”
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mic Jagger says he didn't win with Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an Australian radio interview this week, the pop show stated that it was a Jagger song baking machine in 2004 Old habits game.
Perry said she had dinner with a vet and said, "He's been playing with me when I was 18."
She added: “It was a long time ago, and it was very good.”
In a Thursday statement, the representative of Seven-Fifty-Year Jagger said that he “categorically denied that he had ever caused Katy Perry to do so”.
The representative added: “It is likely that she goes to him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in Rolling Stone this year.
Her new Prism album has been debuting at the first place this week.
The gap with Europe gives Scottish a choice
Another day, another terrible thing about independence.
This time, we are warned that the independent Scotland will have to join the Pan-European Free Movement Zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of passport-control stories in Bervik and the boundary line with a barbed wire along Adrianova.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movement across Europe, although — predictablely — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member countries spent a lot of time turning their formal rules as they conveniently did.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels to replace what it really wanted from Scottishs.
So it's a little bit of a story.
And so old that she's become a dementia: for the first time, I've heard the word “son” that “independentness is passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting moment lost in the story of an old story.
Why is independent Scotland supposed to do European orders?
Why change London’s yoke on Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan finally stalled.
The European project is officially dead with a European crisis.
Throughout the European Union, the parties that speak against the EU or for the removal of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, a party of Europeans called Alterna, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and obtained almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially forcing the Free Democratices (Affirmary of Our Liberal Democratics) from Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan for the establishment of a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis had become a turning point.
The cost-saving measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as those imposed on national economies through the maintenance of a single currency, have led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with the excessive budget deficits of national Governments, which was only fair to Greece.
In fact, the European system has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters — that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a previously disadvantaged position on productive opportunities compared with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut down salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current fiscal and currency problems are behind Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a cipher representing subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and is four times as much gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing adverse pricing environment, as we saw in Granjmut.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the devastating victory over the European petrochemical industry for cheap scrap gas.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, once a strong supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's economy in distress.
The result is that the Marin Le Pen Party of the National Front has just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling party of socialists in third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of votes, to warn British labourists in a timely manner that it cannot be assumed that division among the right-hand parties will automatically affect the left-hand.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to create a unit in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the parties against the EU will be supported by these elections, such a bloc will be able to take up the European Parliament for the first time.
My opinion is that soon growing moods against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a kind of vague European (consisted) nation, which was General de Goll.
Germany and several economies dependent on it can retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I'm guessing Britain's distance from this project, hoping to get close to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific shows the possibility that Britain will be left unheeded in the Atlantic cold.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to the devils.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to secure within a more free European agreement provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, by no means, the most successful political movement in Europe against measures of rigid economy, with an impressive majority of votes in 2011 owing to objections to reductions in costs proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of Treasury, Alister Darlingo, and subsequent coalition of Tori and Liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be reluctant to vote for independence only in order to take measures of strict economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexization: early aging
Research shows that both African and Latin - American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical change does not mean that sexual abuse is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the trigger mechanisms for early puberty.
The tendency towards early puberty is not so expressed by boys
Former correspondent CNN Pat Eteridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family matters.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter is beginning to form breast cods and raise frontal hairs at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents down, ” said Caplovitz, “that does not usually mean a quick rise in full puberty. ”
The visible signs of development, such as rising breasts, frontal and pedestal hairs and body smells, appear before girls.
But there was only a slight displacement at the age of Menarche (first menstruation) for the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“As the breast begins to develop, it goes through at least two or three years before Menarche,” said Caplovitz, who is also author of the book Early Sexual Complication of Girls: How to Cope With This Proliferation Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes a de facto sexual increase in maturity but is considered “advance” when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years of age.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — that the paediatric can be closely monitored.
More rapid progress can be the basis for endocrinologist analyses to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in maturity.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Capitols are safe with drugs, but recognizes that “the prevalence of puberty can mitigate the behavioural problems and feelings of girls, that they are different from peers”.
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or even about how they can handle hygiene, ” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruation at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset because she was the first of her girlfriends.
There's a lot of generalized theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have earlier sexual advances.
Capalitz claims that the preface that has the highest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, linking fat in the body to maturity.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
All around the world, from economic conditions and climate to genes, are likely to affect early sexual development.
Even a mystery: While boys have their hair on their face and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards complete early sexual maturity is not as expressed by girls.
Other doctors participating in AAP confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even young children and children of yeast age are faced with such hairs and forehead hairs.
“We must be careful about how we define the true sexual advance,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrinologist at Horieb Children’s Hospital in Morrisatown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive guidance from a paediatric about how to talk to their child.
“It could mean sooner than expected, ” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Early girls need confirmation that even when this is done before, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for flight
The open Sky Treaty observation flights over the territory of Russia and the unscheduled landing of an American aircraft in Chita on Friday, 1 November, will take place at 8:30 a.m. in Moscow.
The airport authorities allowed the aircraft to take off after receiving fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the aircraft will fly to Ulaan Uda.
According to other data, he's going to be sent to the United States.
The aircraft that flew to Ulaan Oueda reportedly landed in Zabaykal Province because of the fog.
Because of unpaid accounts, he was not released from Chita Airport.
On board are 30 people, including crews, two nights spent at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the MDI of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board have no right to leave Chita Airport, but only two Russian airports in Kutinka and Ulaan Udé can pass border controls.
The Open Heaven Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capacity within OSCE and other international organizations.
How many dead famous IK earn in the U.S.
A ten - year - old editor of the highest incomes in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013, was 160 million.
There's also a lot of other gone-aways who've been "worked" a few times last year.
The second is Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the co-founder of Payuts Charles Schultz, 37 million, is on the list of most recent off-site historians.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million), entered the top five.
It was also listed by Merlin Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
The first face of Igor Gulaev opened in Moscow
On 23 October, the first flagman's bull was opened in Moscow by Igor Gulaev.
Igor Gulaev's designer is known to the general public for his amazing products in the lux class.
And now they will be able to be evaluated by more fashion fans -- at last, his first bean opened in Moscow, which is why the designer and set up a party in the style of delce vita.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I'm particularly glad to have a shop opened in Moscow.
It's not just an office, but a place where I really have part of it.
It was with that expression that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to look at the models that he had looked at!
The jet aircraft manufacturers are hostile about the width of the seat when large orders are made for horseback.
There was a fierce dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of the tourist class on long voyages, the tone for the violent confrontation of the Dubai aviation exhibit this month.
The problem is to turn around the breadth of seats provided on long-range flights to passengers of economic class whose interests are not always at the centre of airline attention, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economic class, but its main United States competition, Boeing, says that it must be decided by airlines.
The fight is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are engaged in a growing version of their two-motor freeway aircraft, and a potentially high order is expected at the 17-21 November event.
The back of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to the statements of economic efficiency of the new mini-equis projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 persons based on economic class seats of more than 17 inches in width, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 would be carried in the economic class of 350 persons on seats with a width of 18 inches, up to 9 in a row.
Airship giants often exchange technical shocks by advertising in a professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the Dubai air force, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
It has recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new publicity war could be, showing the financemen a slide depicting three people in a restaurant attached to each other, entitled “Do you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers long-range flights on seats narrower than those on regional turbine planes,” said the head of sales of Airbus John Likha.
With the change of diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when large-scale Boeing 747 set standards for modern travel, the average American male of 40 to 49 years of age grew by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The U.S. 21st century average male taliva is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health services statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average interception of those recently called the “reactive public” was already present.
Airbus said that he had commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests the Airbus figures by the size of the seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere with the decision on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her research, the convenience of the cabin is not only dependent on the width of the seat.
“It is really about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do to succeed, ” said expert Boeing on Kent Crewer’s cabins.
They don't want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anybody else.
The question for passengers is to increase space by side, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
The dispute is followed by an aircraft race, estimated at at least $7,500 billion at cataract prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of United States and European exports.
As the Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of seats is precisely what fosters competition between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing state a 20 per cent increase in profitability per place in their last two-motor freeway models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365 local Boeing 777-300ER.
The alleged characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of 10 local series 777X with an original nine-bed design of constructive decision 777.
Winning in specific cost decreases when compared with the ten-place layout currently used.
“ The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our designs, ” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that pools with complete 10 seats for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seat of width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is threatened by the 777th model,” said the interior officer Mary Kirby, founder and editor Runway Gril Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not present a chair, but offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose from.
Worldwide, jet aircraft dealers even take their rolls to check competitive planning.
While commending the comforts, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense structure of a cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional salons to be modified, offering greater access points on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producers of large modern aircraft, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may divert attention from the sales wave of the 77X model.
A new anti-niotic vaccine can prevent smoking
Scientists have developed an antibiotic vaccine that could prevent cigarette smoking from happening.
One dose of vaccines has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests were needed before the start of the tests on people, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal, of the U.S. College of Medicine, in New York, said that the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to throw away, trying all the methods available in the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means, ” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that was designed to produce genetic information for the production of anti-net antibodies.
The virus selectively infections liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady flow of antitel.
Antelope trackes any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain to prevent a smoker from receiving a nicotine blow.
During the tests, the immunized mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice, who didn't receive a vaccine, "stabilized," and that's the sign that nicotine got to their brains, say researchers,
These experiments are described in Science Transitional Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they kept antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, they had to be so expensive and ineffective that they had to be used so often.
But the cost of a new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns the liver cells into an antitel factory.
Professor Crystalal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that she will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from it because of a nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Olives: one third of the rural settlements in Podzuzya are fully retracted
The vice-motor Yuri Olenikov stated that nearly one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region are entirely subsidiary
The total income from the budget of the region is 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent additional.
Some 25 billion roubles are sent to the regional budget within the budget,” said Olenikov.
The Governor-General also noted that only three urban settlements - Mitiz, Lstizo and Puskino - had more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
Rural incomes in many areas are less than 3 million roubles, “that is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Posmoscova is over 70 per cent, “with a lower quality of services” noted by Olenikov.
He had previously assigned the heads of the municipalities of Podmoscova to think before the end of November about which settlements needed to be expanded, integrated into the city districts or changed administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, Governor of the Moscow region stated that administrative reform in Poskomcow was planned to reduce the number of impregnable rural settlements.
Also in the Maxai, Kasherski, Sunnzorski, Kolmensk, Lujuerzach and the Cottants, there are requests for the establishment of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue will begin in November in cities and regions of the region.
The President, Mr. Mussildoma Igor Brinzalov, also stated that the admreforms planned some 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmoscow.
This has to do with the fact that of 178 rural settlements in Poscowye, less than a third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a subsidiary base.
Diane Arbenina was late for Halloween with her children
Diane Arbenin doesn't hide how much pleasure she's getting from raising her children.
Although Arbenin is now particularly busy with creativity and public activity, she is still able to appeal to Martha and Artem, not only to spend time teaching them but also to entertain as much as she can.
During the last week, Diane twice read to her worshipers about her teaching talents.
First, she put a picture in Facebook that shows her kids how to read.
And yesterday the fans came in, showing how Artem and Martha were on Halloween.
Our first hollowen's name was Diane's picture of her children dressed in party suits.
And it's not wise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are connected to this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany First in Europe introduces the “undetermined sex” in registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to record children born of hermafrodites instead of men or women to say “undetermined”.
The parents of the child will have the right of time to leave the “field” in the birth certificate unfilled.
For "F" (women's sex) or "M" (male sex) parents may, for the time being, write "X" (undetermined).
This decision is intended not to cause parents to rush up with a sex-reception operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born hemalphrodite.
Triedi denies that Obeda is exposed to influence
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripedi, will be an expert in the investigation of the state's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripedi, refutes the amendment of the rental order of the maritime installations at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who has held a secret share in the three real estates on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to extend the leases to Serkular Ki, where the Obeid family belongs to two restaurants and cafes, without having passed the tender after their term of office in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripedi had been aware of Mr. Obaid's secret involvement in real estate facilities, following the testimony given by former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripedi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be presented for an open competition.
The renters were against it, and they wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the lease contracts for Serkular Ki, which brought Obeid's family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripedi, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, as Mr. Tripedi acknowledged, had urged that the rent policy of the Government should be amended.
The JCAC telephone reconciliations were presented in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripedi and Steve Danna, a senior official who came to the Ports Ministry after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone conversations, the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Mr. Tripedi, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wili.
“No,” Mr. Tripedi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not the case.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes have attacked targets inside Syria
A senior administrative official in the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli warplanes had hit the target at the Syrian port in Latakia on Thursday evening.
He didn't say it was for the purpose, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose of the missiles in Russian production was SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried air strikes on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers in Division 457 may be tested for “substance”
The “validity” test for foreign workers in grades 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it indicates an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on criteria aimed at preventing the use of class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion has been published today, while a former Labour Deputy, Maxine McKew, has criticized the Government ' s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that this could offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Multiful statements of the foreign type end-in-line” and “wandering to Australians' work” are a very unpleasant departure to the times when trade unions required a secure labour market,” she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that had to be protected — and that if some in the region saw the words of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper before us contains 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brandan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of “validity” are accepted, the applicant may be examined for a visa, “if the candidate is genuine when the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of Division 457, since earlier enterprises that intended to finance a small number of employees were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old asylum-seeking Sri Lankan man died of an infarction following his arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grief - stricken nine-year-old son of this man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father died on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas hospital, where he died.
A friend of Simeon Warlamam said he was suffering from alcoholism.
A friend of hockeyist Simeon Warlamam, Evrainy Vavrinyuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, was transmitting the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, in particular, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk was sued for beating Semen Varlamov, who was also a member of the Colorado Club, on the German side.
She said that the hockeyist dragged her over her hair and beat her, after the attack, with her arms, chest, stomach, and neck damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the Denver police and confessed to the beatings, detailing what happened.
He was arrested but later released on bail at $5,000.
The Court did not restrict the athlete to country movements but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 involves the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026
The Minister of Transport of Baroness Kramer noted that the project would “unit Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was “in awe” of his prospects for working on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Island.
When the second phase is completed, lines will be placed in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from ?32.7 to ?42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is engaged in negotiations with Transport State, has entrusted HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and a reduction in travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross the route from Glasgow and Edinburg to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our objective in HS2 is to establish a genuine national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will be faced with a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it's also a city's connection with each other; all over Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburg, will get a better message thanks to HS2.
The Scottish secretary, Alister Carmichael, added: “The late announcement is a good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmikill to support the inclusion of Scotland in HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “A high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed railways across Britain.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of Great Britain to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all and for the continuation of the Glasgow railway line, Edinburg, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Torn is the new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to achieve energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires a large amount of space for generation.
The nuclear power industry is already on its own, but it leaves behind a mass of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to the thorium, another Mendeeva radioactive element.
It is occurring around the world, and experts say that its spread does not leave waste to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their charters and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite mitigation measures in the United States.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allowed United States carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch video or play their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remained at the Flight Range.
Passengers are already able to do so during the main flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical stages of flight were still in force in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
The issue is governed by the regulations that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules they are told of by crew members.
The Virgin company, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi on board, did not mind the changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the review by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of the authorization of electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve the quality of customer service now that it (a wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” said the Spokesperson.
Quantas stated that it would adhere to the current regulations.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we are not about to change it,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study carefully the decision of the FAU and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and depend on the age of the airline.
Transporters will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to mobile devices and review manuals, training materials, manual writing standards and passenger instructions.
“After the airline inspects and confirms its fleet’s permeability, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic instruments, such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew would order passengers to turn off their devices during the landing.
Furthermore, according to the recommendation of the group, heavier devices shall be placed under seats or at the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Gavle Daguestan's notes of extremism are heard in the darkness of Kubani.
The Futball match between Anji and Cuba broke out into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Province and Daguestan after the sickers burned the Daguestan flag, and Mr. Kubani called out in a different way.
The head of Dagesta Ramazán Abdulatifov, on Thursday, invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court because he allegedly called for an inter-national conflict, inter alia, for war with the bassurmans.
Take the Mr. Krasnodar Province, this is in our time approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"O you here, remembering the mother, the enemy, on the basurmanin, we are going to the death battle," for which we said to write to the Hizri Chisaid Parliament, "for which reason we will put some believers on the other believers," expressed solidarity with Abdatispa, President of Parliament, Hizri Chisaid.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Asad
And now, news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck the missiles of Russian production, which are said to have been intended for Hizbollah.
Today Syria has fulfilled an important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement that had been reached through Russia's mediation and had allowed the United States not to carry out the military operation to which they had come by this summer.
More details about weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will be shared by our Chief International Correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August from poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Asad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared chemical factories.
The longer-term and heavier task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand that this is about a thousand tons.
Well, Washington used to say that Assad's days have been counted.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to leave.
But Asad remains.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and ill armed.
His people have been forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Asad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asaad himself has impressed the man ready for cooperation.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the US Ambassador in Syria has had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be better off than were killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding up.
And they change their weapons into power.
President of the Russian Federation established a separate Ministry of Construction and the KCS
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has set up a new Ministry, which manages construction and JCH and has proposed to head his e-Vivian district of Mikhail Menu during a personal meeting.
The President met Mikhail Men in a residence in Novo Ogarevo, and he refused to take the lead in the new institution.
The Russian President's President, Dmitriy Peskov, explained that all of the functions related to construction and the KH are being transferred to the new Ministry of Minsk.
Michael Menen is the son of a prominent Orthodox priest, Alexander Messa, who graduated from the Moscow Institute of Gübkin’s Oil pleaseries.
Since 1995, his political career had begun, and he had been elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Serguev-Possal Region, and he had been a deputy to the State Duma, the first Vice-Premier of the Government of Moscow, the Vice-Premier of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menen was governor of the Ivan region.
The owners of lambards in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is having difficulty
In the Lolobarde, at Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirkhaling provides a gold diamond, ring, and silver to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," says Mrs. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 a month as administrator and her husband is working, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where households are growing — is that ValueMax, where it conducts its trade, became the third blockage registered on Singapore ' s stock market this week.
The jewellery loan is not just a quick way of getting money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but it is also almost as cheap as inadequate banking loans.
In Singapore, for example, the dividends usually provide an effective annual interest rate of 17% — just above 15.4% — of the United Kingdom Bank office, a local creditor with an affiliate at the same shopping center.
However, the break-ups have the advantage of not requiring creditworthiness or salary evidence to be checked and can issue loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are turning to clatters because families feel pressure because of the cost of living and the rapid growth of household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans supported by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are resorted to launders to compensate for income declines as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed out an increase in family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growing mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia has chaired the list from 80 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The point is that, with prices rising, people in the middle and lower [income] will look for ways to increase their income wherever they can,” says Song Seung Won, economist CIMB, Malaysian Bank.
Rarely high gold prices over the past two years have increased the heat with which people put their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore about 70 per cent of the items placed at 200 localities in the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The value of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain on my grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of EsyMone's clatters observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
Growth in log business is like that ValueMax, the Bendemir office operator and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance expansion using 60 per cent of S$66 million this week as a result of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have fired criticisms because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeaah says that the Lombard does not only offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it does not directly increase the debt.
“Care the items they already own, and monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt”, she said.
The mortgage is gaining increased public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, funded funding.
At the same time, the Lombards are not the only ones who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use the offices of ValueMax to lay golden bonds or Ralex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to take short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population not to have the availability and status of the available health facilities but to have the quality of the medical care provided.
The “Tulg Health Modernization 2011-2013” programme, the reorganization of our city's health institutions, will provide the best structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant and newborns.
For example, after uniting up with a gulbon, it was even more possible to bring in narrow specialists from the NCBG to consult pregnant women with different pathologys, to conduct additional examinations at the hospital base.
During the modernization programme, the physical and technical base of the maternity home had been significantly improved, and modern equipment in line with world standards had been introduced.
Over the years, approximately 8 million roubles for major maintenance have been provided, 112 items of equipment valued at 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
The operational section of Caesar's section uses Sal Seaver to collect blood from the operational wound and, after special treatment, to return it to her baby, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinic laboratory diagnostic.
The women ' s consultation had an electronic register, and the introduction of electronic maps and stories of patients was expected soon to take place.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, and newborns with regional specialists.
Schans beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The children of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of a series of attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March this year.
About 60 women were offended by the Caucasus.
The thugs reportedly ordered prostitutes to a strasburg hotel and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old formerly convicted citizen of Chechnya.
Bavaria Protector David Alabama became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, reports an official Bundeligi website.
In that dispute, he had preceded winter sports, which had traditionally become better in the country.
The second seat was occupied by Marseille Hirsher, and the third was by a jump on the skis with the trenches of Gregor Schleenzauer.
In the past season, a 21-year-old Filipino-Nigeriaian Austrian helped his team defeat the League of champions, champions and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
The former wife of Arshavina is resting with the actor Andrem Chadov
The former civil wife of the Pieter Zenita footballer, Andrea Arshavin Yulia Baranovsky, holds her leave with the actor Andrem Chad.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zaret, and her fiance is a figure of Sergea Slavnova, and an actor of Andreya Chadov.
The couple’s sidewalks are published in Instagram Anastasia Over the Road.
It's not the first picture of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, the Excess printed a picture on which the couple stood at the Gulf of Finland in Komarvo.
In mid-October, Andrey Archavin admitted to living apart from his civilian wife, Yulia.
Recall that Julia Baranovsky and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin meets Alice Kazmin's ex- model.
A new friend of Arshavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Aid package of $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that a relief package of $325 million for a weakened health system in Tasmania will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not waste the money.
Tanya Plybersec, Federal Minister of Health, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “slow measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The four-year funding decision was taken after consultation by the Government with the independent representative of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Plybersec today.
A $325 million package consists of $31 million in a planning transaction briefing.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics that receive unannounced patients in Hobart and Lonston to improve the quality of care after confinement, the training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on the ideas put forward by the advanced doctors on how to help the Tasmanian health system better,” said Ms. Plybersec.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would work under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it was spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission would be established to ensure that the staff provided the services as efficiently and as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki stated today that $325 million would not decide if they were followed by genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the state’s critical health system,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sample procedures are largely offset by recent reductions.
But the federal health opposition representative, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to that of the Leaklarian.”
“The reason we're here is that the Labour Government of the State has pulled $430 million out of the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government rips off almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth deposits 300 million, it can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersec to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucratic activities.
Giom Nicla's screening of a novel by Denis Didro can take over the exceptional situation and historical details, but it's also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film that took place in France in the 1760s tells the grim story of Susanne, a young aristocratic woman sent to a monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of a gardener and is subjected to erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to the background or the sensation — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the confession is likely to be a test of what is known as the yeast and the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufactures, says the monitoring group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic munitions, declared on Thursday an international observation team, while violent clashes swept in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
Statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, as established by this Hague-based organization, for Damascus to destroy or “make impossible” all means of chemical weapons production and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with and filling the poison gas.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all of Damascus ' s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer manufacture new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and spinal and nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believe that the chemical weapons facility, as well as its storage sites, is located, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, based in Britain.
The activist group, which monitored the loss through the Syrian activist network, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,665 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Asad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hizbollah fighters.
Also among those killed, as stated in the statement, there were 2,022 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the United Nations assessment of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
The army of Assad fought in Safire for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that on Thursday there were casualties on both sides but that no specific data had been provided.
The fights highlighted the danger faced by chemical inspectors, who were approaching the time-frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it had verified and seen destroyed all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/amendment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security places, stated the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, “the abandoned and ... objects of chemical weapons programmes located in them have been moved to other declared sites which have been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safire was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission that this organization has ever undertaken,” said Achmet Uzumjej, Director General of Monitoring Group, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year of civil war, rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, and the Government of Assad and its security forces, who are members of its tribe of Albanians, have been confronted by Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the leader of Rami Abdurrahman said that there had been a violent explosion on the Wednesday at the POV site in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger because of the conviction of the terrorist organizers in Bali
The remaining 202 victims of the Bali bomb in 2002 responded angrily to the sentence handed down by the last of the conspirators who had been tried and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment yesterday for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he gets parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including in the wave of church explosions across Indonesia in Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, even though they might insist that a person who was summoned by a “explosor” for his reputation as a builder of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad, ” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Zara Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched into a parked outside van immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack that had been bombed just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma three times a month, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the other three members of the Jema Islam terrorist cell responsible for the massacre of Amroszi, Mukhlas and Imam Sablis, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone else.
To keep his life alive, well, there's no reason to keep his life alive.
Twenty years after 202 people were killed and hundreds wounded, that is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the Bali terrorist attack to be brought before a court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbasabad, where the former Al-Qaida leader, Usama bin Laden, was killed by the United States troops less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
“He didn't give up,” said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much pain he had caused to others.
The sentence was issued in anticipation of the tenth anniversary of the attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Virgin passengers may now use flight vigours (but not mobile telephone calls)”
Aviation passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones — according to the longed new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
As soon as that change was made, it would vary depending on the airline, and the FAU administrator, Michael Huert, told the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAUs how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for crew members and set-up regulations in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the status of the plan, we could endorse the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAU.
Currently, passengers are obliged to cut off their smartphones, plates and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet high and the captain gives “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again, when the aircraft is down to land and not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose aircraft is adequately protected against electronic interference, may permit passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, have stated by FAU.
Most new airlines and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gladeing, president of the Association of Professional Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the successful implementation of the new policy (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option”, said Gleeding.
We're really tired of feeling like "school day-careers" when it comes to this question.
But connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, plates and other devices into aircraft.
Thus, there are still no "Sings With Friends" -- an intellectual Internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played his smartphone in 2011 when the incident occurred -- an actor was taken off an aircraft of American Airlines for refusing to remove the device while the aircraft was landing.
More heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they may be injured if they fly around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission, rather than the FAU, is the regulatory authority for telephone calls.
FAUs may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, national transport safety expert CBS News, stated that cellular phones are still considered a risk.
“Sex telephones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know from the FFS that they can interfere with cellular communications when the aircraft is in the air,” said Rosenker.
A sectoral advisory committee established by the FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government permit the increased use of personal electronics.
In recent years there has been pressure on FAU to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the mayor-democracy senator from the state of Missouri Clare McCuckil, claim that there are no valid security-related reasons for the bans.
Limitations are also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of disturbances for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM-radiators, high-tech risks of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAUs as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise altitude for several years.
Vessels modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disturbances.
The vast majority of liners were designed to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Weert.
Today ' s electronic devices usually remove radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
The reading devices of electronic books, for example, produce only minimal signals when you cross pages.
But the signals get stronger when the devices download or send the data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kinle e-books and flew on it to verify problems, without finding them.
The FAH members of the Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association stated that it considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual pilot reports confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAH allow pilots to require passengers to cut off devices during landings on devices in reduced visibility.
The tourism industry group welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards passengers who are now using a variety of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passengers' comforts are not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Cars will be able to run driving tests
Driver rights tests will be available to private companies with their own computerized vehicle.
The “Commersant” writes about this by referring to the Government's draft decision on admission to driving.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 of these automotives in Russia.
It is expected that pupils of such “divided” vehicles will take into account the results of the internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the classrooms do not pass on the first time, the school will be deprived of six months of privileges.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation have been in force since 5 November 2014.
The project also contains training requirements for two-wheeled driving.
Since 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for category A rights will have to pass the urban traffic examination.
In addition, since 5 May 2014 companies will not be able to hire foreign nationals.
Such workers would be required to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird moved by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea was released back to wildlife
The bird was released back into the wild after it was found exhausted in the North Sea oil estuary.
This water trap was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdin last month, followed by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the Alla Rescue Centre.
The manager of the centre of Colin Seddon said: “This is probably a winter North European migrant, who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was razed and could find refuge in the oil tower.
He added: “She was unable to fly again, so she turned to us for help.”
The waterbag was healthy and in good health by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to business with England?
The British Business Campaign was launched in April with an undertaking to gather business representatives and to determine what changes Britain's wealth and jobs want to be seen in relation to the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, Business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be unexpected to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for possibilities for exports beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are in stagnant.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and difficult reform of the EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general frustration with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the regulatory costs from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being found in the European trading zone, even with 40 per cent of the major enterprises that were traditionally the most advanced of all companies in Europe.
Last and most significant, our business managers poll found that the obvious majority wanted Britain to focus on changing the contract and on relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “significant change” that will restore power to Britain.
The rates are high — achieving changes in the contract and better conditions for Great Britain will provide a 16 per cent vote shift for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to review the conditions of British membership in the EU.
He also shows that business expects that a review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial union.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and the results of our survey show that for business, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels regulatory activities.
U.S. authorities are listening to Pope's personal phone
The Vatican’s work is under U.S. Special Service supervision.
New documents from Edward Snowna's collection show that the U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now Pope Francis is very much on the agenda.
His phone began to be heard before he became the Vatican’s head.
The new pope's election process was also monitored.
What was particularly important in the United States.
The Special Service has joined the cell phones of cardinals who have gathered in Rome to select the next Pope.
There were also telephones in the hall where participants lived.
The U.S. spies listened to all the main applicants on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine says that the "U.S. big ear" has continued to capture prelate conversations until the end of the convoy of 12 March.
In the United States, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio is said to have been designated in 2005 as the future of the Pope of Rome.
American intelligence has also been following negotiations on the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Roman Embassy continues to operate a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives who receive information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, peacefully declared that it was not concerned with the American “dry,” even if it did.
There are no secrets from U.S. officials.
The Olympic Sounder was especially photographed
The Bank of Russia released a memorial note on Sochi City on Wednesday, where the Olympic Games will be held in winter.
Rates are 100 roubles.
But the bloggers on the network are already actively booking about a remembering bank.
Following the presentation of the Olympic merchant on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the online snowhead can be found in a photobank.
In particular, in the Free StockExchange photo repository, where the photo was dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the photo lesson on Photoshop, published on the Russian website, Megastock, on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising for smartphones RugGree.
The Olympic Bank is done in a blue blue blue blue gamma.
On the one hand, it's a snowboard flying over Sochi, on the other, a species of Olympic stadium and Jar Pititz.
The author of the banking design was Paul Bushev, who won the competition with students at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered - mining, Christian and trenches, but ended up choosing snowboards because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source “Investigation”, close to the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion about the widespread spread of the image of a snowman with the Olympic Bank and is now examining the situation.
But in Gosinka, you don't worry too much about the noise around the Olympic bank.
The chairman of the State Press Service, Gossclinka Natala Nikiforov, told the Witnesses that all the discussions about the plagiar were funny.
A snowman on the bank will turn to the right, and the photos on the network to the left, and he'll tell Nikiforov.
A person on a photo session to create a dome was removed from different locations, then a final image was taken, and it was a sub-separate character.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic Bank because the artist had been paid for his work.
Experts considered that the discussion of the image on the Olympic dome was very positive.
The recognition of the image on the dome, plus for its advancement, is considered by Alexey Popvicov, Executive Director of RusBrend.
It's hard to prove a hundred percent similarities between a dome and a photobank, so claims to challenge the intellectual property on this image are unlikely to be made.
For the first time, the Olympic Bank was launched in China, the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less than beer
The Russian brewers have a bad mood.
They suggest that beer consumption in the country will remain at the same level next year, at best.
Even though the businessmen were originally looking for growth.
After all, the current year is not good for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Both led the head of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Council of the Russian Beers Union, Isaac Scheps, to the III Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute of the “Day Demand Forums in Russia”, which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as the country had seen a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and trafficking of beer, with low alcohol content, and had reported to the Scheps audience in recent years.
No country in the world has so severely restricted the beer market, which is unpredictable in introducing new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged struggle against alcohol abuse.
The pioneer visited that many legal prohibitions to reduce the level of alcohol abuse were not having a significant impact, but new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The coldest beer producer hit the ban imposed this year on the sale of alcohol in the cystics.
"We've lost 35,000 customers right away," said Isaac Scheps.
For the next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistically, the one that Scheps spoke of: the sale of beer will remain at the same level.
Pessimist - an additional 2-3 per cent drop.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from the consumer class to the "premium" class; beer will become less than that, but it will cost more.
However, the radical impact of the fall of sales with a small amount of alcohol is yet to be seen.
"In my observation, the level of alcohol disease remains at about the same level,” said Dr. Alexei Sotnikov, a doctor.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use harshly strong drinks, as well as those who are “dwellings” on alcohol - like Jaguara drinks, while years ago it was the alcohol problem that dominated it.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's car factory in Wvojlansk.
According to trade unions, all prisoners were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is more acute than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, the Députate of Regional Zachs, Alexei Etmanov, stated that some 600 people had been reduced in the factory of Ford in Allomsk.
He said it had taken place back in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory under the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the union.
A number of salaries were proposed for workers who had decided to quit by their own will.
As a result, the vast majority have left jobs of their own volition.
However, according to Ethmanov, this number of people is a complete night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
However, the authorities are not planning to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficult situations,” he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the Government does not take into account the stabilization of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In "Forde", this information is neither refuted nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it gets here, we're going to have to publish it.
Talking about the reduction of workers in the Forda factory in Wedlansk is a long way off.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known back in September.
The factory had previously declared a suspension of the production of vehicles.
For reasons, the factory called the fall in demand for Ford in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblast fell by 5.4 per cent after nine months of 2013.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile aircraft can be used during take-off and landing
New safety regulations for mobile devices during take-off and landing of airlines have been approved in the United States, reports BBC.
The United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the journey, and the new regulations will be in force by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connectivity for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, the cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Air travel passengers will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other sites and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the anticipated impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, according to the U.S., current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight may also be reviewed in Britain.
A new name for the "Russia Mafia" in the United States is finally attached to the "Brata Circle"
This week, the Black List of the "Russia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has brought three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli to the “Bratian Community”.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer, Grigroy Leps, who was suspected of transporting money to group members.
On the United States blacklist, 22 persons involved in the "Brata Community" and six related organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization did exist.
“The announcement of the “Brata Circle” is more of an attempt to bring together fragmented criminal groups”, the expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galetti of the University of New York.
In his view, the "Bratian Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian Mafia".
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or elsewhere who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti as the United States Centre for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Schelli of the University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Centre for the Exploration of Corruption and Organized Crime cites it.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brata Circle" was bringing together more closely the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Ussan, known as Grandpa Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, Lasha Shushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely associated with David Hassan and Deud Hassan, another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, had a nephew.
However, he noted that some individuals were not relevant to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them had brought together common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, a scandal surrounding the inclusion of the Grygoonium Lepsa, a favorite singer of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, caught the attention of Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner partners, and so it was decided why he was placed on such lists,” said the Spokesperson of the Head of State, Dimitri Pekov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
Head Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The launch of the South Stream Gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launching of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, stated Head Gazprom.
“It was a landmark event this afternoon: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline site South, the largest and most important project in Europe, ” said Chairman Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Flow is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is located, increases the risk level for ordinary routes, are spoken by officials.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks of transit countries had been eliminated “all the time”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff members are charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord were made known to the Royal Commission
Two members of YMCA NSW were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the indictment in 2011 against a staff member of the childcare institution in Karingbah Jonathan Lord, and reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's introductory statement stated that she “had never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within her organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Hayra, was asked about one case in which a YMCA worker was charged with child pornography and another in which a sports instructor in YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told Gail Fernes, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case, but did not know about the second one.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in an introductory speech to the Commission, had also been inaccurate, claiming that “there were external checks of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was in the front row to ensure the safety of children”.
The evidence provided to the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible quality audit evaluations by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayr, who had joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed to recruit Lord, nor had they been able to provide a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Heir rejected the suggestion that the YMCA corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord's safety in children.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, had taken care of them personally, had taken them to his knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to use his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by Lord and asked to teach her how to protect her children, because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that she had found Jackie Barnath, the custody manager of YMCA’s children in Karingbach, who was head of the Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to access”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from staff members that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them away from the thought of having to report it.
Mr. Heer said that he had presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization of the “inquiries with Jonathan Lord” was not “inviting information” by the staff members, and the Board agreed with it.
Mr. Heir stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictment had been made by the Director-General of YMCA for the custody of children, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was designed to prevent the loss of evidence, but that he was “frust down” and that the decision was not well implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during its work by Jonathan Lord during the period 2009-2011, reported to the Commission an expert on child-breeding Professor Stephen Smolboun of the University of Griffith.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, mentoring, training and monitoring staff.
Hearings are postponed until 20 December.
A week of fashion in São Paulo.
It's not just a mandrake but a real star.
Although Giselle Bundschen left her job for a while, being distracted from motherhood, on these days and this week, she arrived on purpose.
The absence of many months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Life remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time she's been in the Clinchie detachie.
The fashion week film is usually the most interesting show.
It's like what Lino Vilaventure's stylist has organized.
Marke is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of class pre-a-port, and the designer works actively in the theater and in the film making and developing costumes for many of the well-known paintings.
A total of more than 30,000 firms and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final week of the fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic manufacturing spheres, with more than 2 million Brazilians working in it, and an annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said that he would take advantage of the chance to return as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
On the eve of the fifth anniversary of his post, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blar has largely avoided British policy discussions, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East Peacemakers.
In answer to a question whether he would have returned to Prime Minister Blar, according to the London State, said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
The chief trainer, Massimiliano Allegary, deplored the insignificance of the 10th Italian championship from Lacio.
The specialist also noted that startup failures are due to a series of traumas of leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, which is the Tmw word Allegary.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
The second Romans added, but in general I can't say we've lost our concentration.
We had to win.
In the past season, we've met the challenge of getting into the League of Champions.
Now we're lagging behind the schedule, but that's due to a series of traumas of key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the anti-portation events that moved to Cardiff to fight for the award of the year, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the arrival of the 3-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, who had taken his first steps, this kid and her pet, the Shetland ladies, Toffy, swept through three tours to take the main prize with ease, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This mixed couple — the same growth — received high marks for the appearance, conduct and style of the annual competition held by Sannibenko's Mount Sport Center in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
When he came out of a general view of men and women in their fancy hats, he pushed his cap in the face and held a proud two-year-old Toffy over the course of his own head.
The judges praised Fenton for not having developed inborn horse management at all for years.
And Toffy got the highest estimate for his appearance and character.
Fenton gave Toffy his third birthday last March, and since then he has had a Scottish pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy make a fine duet."
They had many rivals, but those two left with a gold cup and a scoop.
It was just his second statement with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The total strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy, from Nantiglo, who is near Abb-Wail in South Wales, walks in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been delivering horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “All the public was struck and everyone was shouting with approval and braiding.”
He ran across the sand all over the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he made a fine case.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares for.
From his start, he will soon be taking part in the Leshadi Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibit said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they presented themselves on the show market.
They value the consistency of the ponies and the manufacturer — Fenton and Toffy were the best at the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped him out, he was really good at his role.
The announced call of the Chinese newspaper for “Redesignation”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a front-line call for the release of the accused in the reporter ' s slanderer ' s office, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper of Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of a journalist, Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a State share of property.
The “New Express” now has to go through “the complete correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The order on error management came from the Guanduns office in the press and publications, radio, film and television.
Preliminary investigation has shown that Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express published several false reports on Zomlion registered on the Exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The direction of the “New Express” has been dedefinite,” says the regulator’s statement.
He states that it is decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Junzhou in the form of withdrawal of his reporter's licence”.
He also “has instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make full corrections to errors in the “New Express” and recommended that it investigate the situation of the newspaper’s responsible and immediately amend the leadership of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express” in which he stated that he had committed financial violations in the construction equipment of a company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published on the front strip two calls for his release, stating that she supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on the State television, acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case I have damaged Zomlion, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to trust the public,” he said to the state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After the confession of Mr. Chena, the New Express, issued an apology on the front strip, stating that the newspaper had failed to verify his reports properly.
Recently, several senior suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of beating confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from coercing anyone into self-determination.
The United States Tunnel — Mexico for drug transfer, equipped with its own iron road
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical relief systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as being four feet wide by three feet as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has a length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses around the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with unmarked warehouses, thus facilitating the latent loading of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs, as claimed by the authorities, were unmarked.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when finding a tunnel.
Three men, who were said to have been drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for dissemination.
If convicted, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground wires.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their product rapidly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passageway of about 700 yards, equipped with rail routes coming from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two parts of San Diego.
Pensions have been raised in Belarus since November
Belarus has been raising pensions since November this year, and has told BELTA to a correspondent in the General Pension Authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As of 1 November this year, an adjustment will be made to the average salary of employees in the Republic applied during the previous re-recruitment of pensions, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding conversion of workers ' pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the promotion of pensions.
Recalculation from November will increase the age of employment pension by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension would be Br2 million.
The increase in pensions is 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus will increase its pensions on a monthly basis from November this year to Br274.3 billion.
At the same time as re-calculations in November of the year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and benefits will be exceeded, owing to an increase in the per capita subsistence budget.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government of the amount of Br1 million 530 by 2.1 per cent higher than the current amount from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, 2.1 per cent of minimum employment pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and benefits will be increased as from 1 November.
In Belarus, more Br53 trillion-0-th was laid in 2013 for pensions taking into account increases
The British police give Asanhu notification of extradition
The British police today have notified the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who had fled to Ecuador's Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland-Yard, they stated that they had given an Australian 40-year-old “formal requirement to leave” with a request to appear at a police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be further arrested.
Assanjo is in danger of extradition to Sweden on sexual charges after he has exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal of extradition earlier this month.
In view of Stockholm's transfer of it to the United States, on 19 June he took refuge in Ecuador's Embassy in London, requesting political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Jard “has given a 40-year-old man a formal demand to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station for a day and a time of our choice”, as the Spokesperson reported.
It continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of notification to the police.
Assang fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible accusations of espionage after more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic incidents have been published against the secrecy of the Wikipedia website.
Driver driving 130 miles in hot drinks between the legs, fined on ?1,000
The motorist was fined on  в 1,000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with hot drinks held between the legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Hooi of Tipri, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the track of A120 at Breintra on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
In the World Court, Colchester Houi admitted that he was charged with leadership without due diligence or attention.
In addition to his driving certificate, seven penalty points resulted in a six-month ban on entry.
Howo also undertook to pay the costs of " 90 and a supplementary fee to assist crime victims in the amount of " 100 " .
Tax for foreign real estate owners will result in London bubble popping up
The Treasury carried out a preliminary valuation of the capital growth tax, but looks forward to a final decision by Mr. Osbourne, who imposed 7 per cent of the State tax rate in 2012 for homes with a value of more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own their homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
So far, the hospital for residential real estate in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, has already exceeded the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber combined.
Mr. Cooke stated: “It is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive property is undervalued regardless of the influence of an outdated municipal tax system since the increase of government duty stations on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-degradation legislation”.
“But this step may lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The cost of the first-class real estate, the top 5-10% of the housing market at the price of London’s rich south-west belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by 11.8% in the record year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in the centre of London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% in annual terms, but were affected by the actively growing domestic market, with a surge in the prices of south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog’s tail moves toward its mood.
Early research has shown that the happy dogs turn their tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tails to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailing and responding to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neuroscientist at the University of Trinity, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are different in the formation of incentives that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right part of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the isolation of other dogs ’ tails, researchers watched animals watch movies about other dogs.
They measured animal heart rate and examined their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes go another way.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs - either naturalistics or silhouettes - to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail movement and send the tail to the left or to the right”.
When animals saw nothing in the rest of the dog moving its tail to the right (in terms of the tailing of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was inclined primarily to the left, their heart began to rise and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigar said that he didn't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experiences about which movements they should worry about and what they should not.
He observes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail often lies in more friendly behaviour, and the right hand side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of that experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The dog expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the British University Veterinary School of Veterinary, said that it was not the first study to verify whether the dogs were left and right.
Last year a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads left if they looked at an aggressive dog and right if they looked at a good dog.
And in another research work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the labor dog when the rear of the dog was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, to act contrary to the Italian study.”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in different studies did not fully perceive animals in films or dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“As there is sufficient evidence in various mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified and the dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, we will likely soon understand why their tails are sometimes on the same side and sometimes on the other side.
The Arc Monkeys are delaying a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Rock-group Arce Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after her scab had been diagnosed with larining.
This Chieffield Group was supposed to be at Hydro's concert hall on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s disease forced them to move the show.
This statement was made after she had had had to postpone the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys reported: “After deciding to move the show to the Bermingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical assistance, Arce Monkeys should also postpone the show to the Hidro site on Friday, 1 November, in Glasgow”.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed as "Laringit," and unfortunately he is unable to speak."
The show on LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, and the show in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.
All the tickets to these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all the holders of the tickets for any inconvenience they have been causing.
In order to obtain any additional assistance, please contact the cell cash client department in which you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will introduce the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to the Sanctuary for the first time in his employment on 22 February, as the Vatican declared on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the supreme clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the popes, so that Francis will appoint their first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the pope's election — it is the prerogative of the 120 group of voters.
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals known as a consul would be held prior to the ceremony.
“Papa Francis decided to report in advance his decision to convene a Consistration in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls so many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal voters back to 120, as well as so many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wishes.
Consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis were elected in March this year, according to Valero.
To date, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It would be interesting to see whether the new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first cardinals chosen since the formation of the French Council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that “it's possible” that Francisk would seek advice from cardinals.
But we were not in this situation before that — all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taking the position of cardinal Bishops from major tributaries, but Francis “the field of surprises — so we don't know who he's going to call”.
GM calls back a number of new pixels in the United States to fine-tune the seat backs
The General Motors Co calls off almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverados and the GMC Sierra Model 2014 to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, as notified on Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulators.
On some of the pickles, the front seat may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result of the seat back, the federal head restraint safety standards do not correspond to the federal head restraints.
“A head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers in the event of a rear impact, increasing the risk of injury”, says the notification on the National Road Safety Administration website.
The reflected models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM pick-up began in June and is the most important starting-up of a car in serial production for a leading American motor manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
The GM informed the pick-up owners of a defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notification to owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in the sale of cars in October.
Silverado and Sirra pics, which were modernized for the model series of 2014, grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado picts and 16,503 Cyrra Pictaws.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37.47.
The cry of desperation of Obama’s elector
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the Republicans to delineate their laudable efforts.
Designism cannot serve as a justification for the problems with the website of the health-care system reformed by Obama, the attacks of the illiterates
The 2008 Obama Campaign Mamuras are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris, a second year of course at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I'm reading a terrible sad book these days.
I thought that book would inspire me at a time of depression at the second year of the Medical School and give me a sense of hope.
It's called the Triumph for Victory, and it's the memoirs for Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish writing reports on my patients at night and go to bed, it brings back me when politics inspired millions of people and what I heard could be a thrill.
The election has proved to be impressive, and leading news programmes have paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
The White House was supposed to be a young team of strategic men, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return is a rude awakening, a stifling out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant reminder, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
The years that have elapsed since I released my first ballot papers have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical assistance to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule of “Don't ask, don't say”, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party construction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and closures in Guantánamo.
But after many times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended up with explanations I could give.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The structuralism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or to attack innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistle-blowers exposing Government misconduct.
He could not explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Avlaka, without trial and investigation, or the failure to comply with State financing and expenditure limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the efforts of the White House to silence the media have been “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
And, more recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I, at 18 years of age, understand that leadership can be contrary to the political campaigns that are preceded by it?
It is clear that the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the bombing in Newton.
Nevertheless, the examples I have cited above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiast about his candidature.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rough alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to take a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in his second term, Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would justify the hopes that we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 with the book.
This makes me miss many of the promises that have gone away.
This week, I've read the part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the causes of failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“ I want us to regain our appeal, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that a member of Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest on parental leave.
Deputate-milliarder Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest on parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnet, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he tried to turn away from questions as to whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to cancel carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be of ministers, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the struggle for a seat from Sanshin-Cth of the Ferfax Electoral District, with 53 votes overruns.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the counting of votes in elections to expedite the process.
Tony Abbot's daughters Francis and Bridget.
Should the election be decided two months after we voted?
“We need a better system, ” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in ballot papers.
Is that because they can't tell the outcome if he doesn't like anyone?
It seems strange to use the pencil in our time.
The Electoral Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshin Koth, and he would be “very serious” about his new work.
Public office implies service to society.
“We seek no reward except for the gratitude of history, for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended the work of two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people who are familiar with the situation, which is another indication that the global audit by the currency market regulators is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in investigations involving the largest financial market in the world, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first members of the RBS to be withdrawn during an ongoing investigation, which is echoed by a scandal related to manipulations with the LIBOR interbank rate.
The bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation is continuing, and we cooperate fully with FCA and our other regulators two weeks ago,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
In the past month, knowledgeers said that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the British Financial Performance Control Authority (FCA).
The trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave for his current post as Head of European Spouse Exchanges at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchardani, head of European sweatshops in Citi, left for leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency dealer in Barclays and UBS, was dismissed from his job by the Statedard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group of instant messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to well-known individuals.
The Bank of UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss Finnish regulator Finma said that he would investigate suspected currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies around the world — the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — consider allegations that bankers entered into conspiracy to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, and said persons familiar with the situation.
Banks look through instant messages and e-mails in a few years in search of cases of offences.
In recent years, news of verifications has been uprooted by traders in activities, one of the largest sources of revenue from trade units in investment banks, which this year has, however, been difficult because low currency volatility reduces the enabling capacity of buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the gravity of the situation by saying that the vast and highly-lying currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior traders, despite the huge volume of daily exchange markets, the fragmentation of liquidity between various trade platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very small price”.
This news came on the same day that Bank Credit Suisse announced that he had dismissed one of the traders of the London Stock Exchange Division this week, after having caused the loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has been dealt with,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the Barack Obama Health Act is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
After having voted 5 v. 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the patient protection law and accessible health care requiring citizens to receive medical insurance before 2014 or to pay fines were constitutional in accordance with the Government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, appeared to the four more liberal members of the court, while judges Skali, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-country law and further found that the health-care law required that the states should improve compliance with the Melicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have taken action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
It's the cause of the breakup.
In Gosdum, in the Open Policy Framework and experts spoke about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
It was suggested that football be banned in the Northern Caucasus because it is the same game as scandals and differences.
Squiker Sergey Narakkin recalled recent events in Birrulev and said that policy and media needs to be adjusted to reduce the “gradion of social tension”.
Perhaps he was referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zyrinsky, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with a barbed wire unless they wanted to limit fertility...
All speakers also referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations between the peoples residing in Russia, which contributed to the discussions of Amality.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Birrulev were “a model conflict that could have been predicted”, but “for these questions we have too many people and institutions” and seven baby-less children.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time had been practiced against migrants by Europe, in the opinion of the public, had failed and must be sought.
The historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new single history book.
“The other thing to do is to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the people of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatar will know what people are living for in Daguestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed criminal liability for “Crimes to Dismember Russia”: “If you say on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison.”
Vladimir Zyrinsky was trying very hard not to be burned.
As usual, he accused journalists who are bringing sick and acute national problems to a public discussion, "There's little to say in the dust!"
The leader of the Factions, Vladimir Vasiliev, also advised journalists to conclude a charter and agree to engage in discussions on the subject in an orderly manner, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have adopted some 30 laws governing migration, and the order is generally determined by Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that held the regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share her appreciation for this law: it does not contain “clear perceptions of what migrant adaptation, mechanisms and limits are.
Hence, the scope of these powers will be interpreted differently by the subjects.
Moreover, municipalities do not have the necessary personnel to deal with such complex issues, nor do they have the resources to make use of the methodological recommendations that they can use.
The Head of the Mental Committee for Nationalities, Ghajimt Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with a formidable title, “National Security Ministry”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s that had been abolished, opposed it.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level a special person, a “master without portfolio”, to whom could be approached if anything were to be done.
“We walk across the land, the shells are torn around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work must receive adequate information support”, said the RCC representative on relations with the society of Lord Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religion, in its view.
Oleg Nilov put the discussion in an unexpected direction: "The pain of talented men is greater than that of Chechnya or Dagestan, and it is necessary to find them, but it is not the way, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football, "that football player beats the whole crowd, the flags go down, the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another kind of sport, there's a regby called...
"They won't be in the world in this kind of sport!" said a good deal.
No one's gonna play in the Caucasus.
You're still going to offer leadership to them!
We need to know national specificities, it's like Georgian Zaspore.
In Jaroslav, there was a wild behaviour on the podium with representatives of the Moscow Club when they were playing with a local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
Arthur Grigiantz, the head of the RFS Monitoring and Disciplinarian Committee, reported that Cuba had fined 500 thousand rubles, transmitting Philippe PAPENKOV from the House of C.E.'s soccer Correspondent.
Such sanctions against the Red-Load Club were imposed on Dagestan's flag on the fans on the rostrum during the 14th round of the household match against Anja.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
For improper conduct by Cuban viewers, 500 thousand roubles are fined.
Against Google companies, Samsung, Hawei submitted claims on Nordel patents
A group owned by thousands of former Nortel patents filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone producers on Thursday, including a Google company whose price she had lost at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Northel patents, filed claims for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court against Samsung Elictronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Hawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of a violation of seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key Internet search words with related ads, which are the basis of Google search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Hawei, HTC and Rockstar were neither available nor commentable.
Samsung, Hawei and HTC produce telephones on the Google Android operating system, which competes severely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Northel's patents an initial price of $900 million.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel company Rockstar patent, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, the patent library of Motorola was in part a determining factor in the transaction.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires higher recovery from Google because he claims that a Google patent violation is deliberate according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes the oath
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he sworn to become the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was sworn 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt, following the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black mantles in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and the second Republic,” said Murcy during a solemn ceremony that was held live on State television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursey, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brasulman, a fundamentalist group that, most of its 84-year-old existence, has been banned by an organization that served as a target for the rigid actions of successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Murcia arrived with a small corte shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time to skip his convoy on a generally busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursey was ridiculed as a non-harismal “hazardous wheel” of Brativ, his personal prestige had risen sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only to Islamists, but to all those who wished to bring the case to a conclusion in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“This afternoon Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the back of the wooden panels of the hall where it took an oath.
In time, Mursey went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to speak inisulate.
He was granted an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the state gimon, during which he stood on a “serious” stand.
There was a military official, Feldmarl Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was met by the slogan “Army and the People, One Hand”, which scanned hundreds of assembled in the university’s main lecture room.
Founded in 1908, the University of Cairo, in the 1970s, became a fabric of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in the Tahrir Square, where a rebellion arose that had culminated in the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to regain the powers of the President, whose office was deprived of the military council that had taken action against a overthrowed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court, not before Parliament, as accepted, he is carrying out the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in the Tachir Square was filled with popular populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tumen Engineer Association was held at the Yalatorian Motor Vehicle Plant.
The event launched a new line for the production of steel electro-story tubes.
As the business director of the Denis Gribanov business explained, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner to study the market for the marketing of steel structures in the Tumen region.
It has become apparent that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrical pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the factory profile and installation of equipment for its production.
Already this year more than 7,000 tons of production has been shipped.
Investment in the factory amounted to over 120 million roubles, told Denis Gribanov.
A new state was launched in October to increase the range.
The factory produces both a small tube profile, which is used for tep household, small construction forms and the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach 50,000 tons of production per year, about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the size of the enterprise staff has not decreased - it now stands at 157, with plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 additional staff.
Staff are being re-training at the enterprise and the required specialists are selected from the existing ones.
The next year is planned to introduce a new longitudinal rubber aggregate with a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the products, as well as another condition, at the rate of production of the pipes up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the plant was about to release pipes that were used in the housing sector.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the requirements of the Tumen region in this area.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumi, has suggested that more attention be paid to the upgrading of engineering plants in the course of the process.
This has also been done in the form of State support for industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates for credit for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lising.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, with two thirds already spent.
The latter commission, which would review the grant contracts, accepted documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget recovers the costs of local producers participating in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides for 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for lysing payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million to energy saving programmes.
The amount of roubles is reduced to 72 million roubles for ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of Tumensk region for the oil and gas complex.
In the future, according to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expendable obligations in the region.
With this in mind, the Government of the Region has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises, rather than financing through the oil industry.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the oil situation.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchased is a competitive advantage of the southern Tumen industry and, if abolished, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the middle part of Russia, where the cheaper labour force is.
In addition, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of TNC-XO, Rosnefti, which has not yet placed its orders in Tumen ' s enterprises is unclear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uva project expires in 2013 and no requests for extension have been received.
At present, Southern enterprises that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for a future year.
The question remains whether taxes will come from the oil produced in the Uvat region to the region ' s budget or will be paid at the location of the new owner of the deposit.
Tomić will work 240 hours for an extremist video on social media
The Tomska District Court of Lenin sentenced 240 hours of compulsory work by a city resident who posted an extremist video on the social network to RIA News on Friday, a representative of the Regional Court’s press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted on his page a popular social network of video recordings on the federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Activities aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as a violation of the dignity of the individual committed in public”.
“The Lenin District Court has examined the case on a special basis and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing the penalty of 240 hours of mandatory work,” said the agency's interlocutor.
She added that the man was fully guilty.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a price collapse after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country has signed an agreement of association with the European Union.
He spoke to the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, since the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties for imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that's going to mean that prices should go down.
“It is with regard to goods originating from EU countries”, wrote Azarov.
With respect to other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
However, there should be no price increases there either.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently appeared in our country, that an association with the EU is a price increase, is not so, or, more precisely, is not true,” summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify child abuse in Bishka
On 29 October, the media reported that one of the kindergarten kindergartens in Biska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are now examining all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
Upon the charge of the stupidity of Eugia Vasiliev,
Euguiya Vasileva, who has been assigned close attention to the media for almost a year, has never commented on many publications in the press, either about the thefts in Minoborova or on her personal relationship with the defence minister, Anatoly Serdukova, her poetry, and her passion for valuable things.
However, on 1 November, a piece of Defense Services violated silence.
In a interview with Life News Vasiliev said, "It was, of course, one task: to extract any negative information from me against the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail that meant that I had to testify or that I was going to be sent to prison.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we prove ourselves innocent.
We're 100% sure of the victory.
The interview concluded, however, that it was perhaps the best thing Vasileva had to say that she did not taste anything.
It is likely that a statement by the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that there were counterfeitings in the collection of the paintings collected by the Defense Services case.
Among the property arrested, there are a number of paintings that the master master, confident of her profound knowledge of art, acquired as a masterpiece of the world's painting.
However, an expert survey appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they were of no artistic value and, to say the least, cheap counterfeitings,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from Minoborone, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal points?
I think it's just meaningless," Vasileva says.
On the other hand, Vasileva stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC Russian Federation that Vasileva was turning away from examining the criminal file, the bar of the skater said that he and his client “does not get to know the file of the case”.
What led to the revelation of Vasyleva, who had not yet been contacted by the press?
How could a woman have failed to respond to the bad taste charge?
Or is it right to journalists Comsolki who claimed a couple of days ago that she “falled into an even more trans under house arrest” because of news of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdewova and his wife and his return to the bosom of his family?
The famous military columnist Viktor Baranette, in his article "Sarduks Back to his wife?" wrote: "The Witnesses do not rule out that after this shock, she may become more conversational on interrogations."
In the past, Vasiliev had been accused of selling his real property illegally.

Flight Central seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its forecast of profits for a full year and looks forward to record revenues from resters in Australia and Great Britain.
This tourist firm now expects its main total annual income to tax ranging from $325 to $340 million, compared with the previous projection of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmark is achieved, this would be a 12-17 per cent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011-2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Central received 8 per cent of the profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performances, especially on non-dividual trips to Australia and Britain.
“ Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to make a record year’s profit before subtracting interest and tax contributions, ” he said.
- This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business in the second half has recovered, compensating a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain business Flight Central went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States had compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half-year and was expected to return in the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Central shares grew by 3 cent to $38.20.
On 31 October, Baraul police officers found two playing rooms.
The first one worked in the industrial area on the Street of Vislet.
At the time of the inspection, the institution was in play.
There were 24 assault rifles in the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
We used 20 games' guns here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for Barnaul reports that administrative material on the subject of illegal organization and gambling has been produced.
The technician's been removed.
The facts will soon be made available to the courts of the Industrialization and Lenin district of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police were searching for a criminal who had been cruelly mistreated with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the New Region, the Ministry's press service on the Sverlovsky Region, which was on the eve of the day in the Kwirl district of Ural, reported that two women had been found in a three-room apartment in a residential house on the street of Uralski, and had been exposed to the bodies of two women who had been forced to die.
Soon the identity of the victims was identified.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them was Ekaterinburg, 44 years old, and the other was a 33-year-old resident in the district of Orenburg.
They rented the apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was under personal control by the Chief Police in the Mikhail Bordina region.
The internal affairs authorities develop various forms of murder, inspect the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to commit such acts.
It also establishes the purpose of the woman ' s apartment to be rented and where they lived before they had dealt with whom they had dealt.
Schools called for more attention to be paid to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also present “non-programme texts” to encourage wider reading.
Integrated English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate graduation examination in the language, with persistent recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should produce new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will amend other substantive items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the examination of OFQUAL will present a revised structure for secondary school examinations, with a new evaluation system and a lower level of course.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gauves, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence”, insisting that school examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore’s pupils spend about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale math school examinations, combined with an increased rating rate in the table, are likely to be an incentive to provide further training for schools in this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real life issues”, including financial mathematics.
Hayhee tickets will be for tourists in 2,200 roubles
Since tomorrow, tourists from Blazvis in Hayhee will be taking ships on the air cushion.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra costs
The puma ticket is traditionally far more expensive than the heat.
As reported in the reference service of AmurASSO, the value of the ordinary ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It will cost 2,800 roubles.
To say that, the tickets did not travel during this season — the same price was used by the pumas to bring tourists back in the spring and the year before autumn.
Medvedev's GDP growth rate is not sufficient for the State's development
Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev considered that the growth rate of his GDP was insufficient for the RF and was confident that the situation could be improved by simplifying business credit conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, to say Reuters.
We planned GDP growth this year in the area 3%, maybe even a little bit more.
It's going to be a little bit less than 2%.
Against the background of the recession in a number of European countries, it's kind of not very bad, but it's not good for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to evolve, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal loans at the normal price -- that's the first thing to do," stressed the head of Government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, doctors don't have that much — just one per 5,000 people
vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become Heroem Year CNN.
That person's going to get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
During the 21 years, George Bwell saw his father come back to life and regained consciousness by throwing himself into hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwell was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken hand, but an emerging infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that remembered herself for the rest of his life.
“ Cameroon had no neurosurgery, ” said Georges Bwelle.
If we had money, we'd have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, he accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It’s not easy, ” Bwell said.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m., get to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of Parcients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
By contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if cameras could go to a doctor, many of them wouldn't have been wearing a pocket.
Two out of five people in that country lived below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of its health spending was private.
“ Their only problem is poverty, ” said Belle.
- And they cannot enjoy their lives because of poverty."
Seeing the suffering of his father and the great number of his compatriots, Belle was determined to do something about it.
Last year Dr. George Bwell and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
It also established a non-profit organization ASCOVME, which organizes travel to a rural area on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and another 30 people are found in vans, tied to roofs of medical supplies, and traveled through the area to visit the villages in need.
They don't always get along with luck.
They had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met as real heroes — a celebration with songs and dances and the best spaces local residents can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a occasion for the celebration, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and limitless energy, is more than happy to join the party.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on every trip, ” said Belle.
They come from the entire district to a radius of 60 miles [60 km] from the village, and they walk.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may obtain caskets, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At night, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school building, a municipality or a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-operation zone to make room for the next person.
Using a maintenance and sanitation generator, Belle and his volunteers work until the early morning of Sunday.
It's not a strong pace, but the team's commitment usually helps to support village musicians.
“They beat their drums all night to keep us awake and to keep working, ” Bwell said.
On Sunday, crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This team, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations during the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free skin operation he received would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family, ” said a man.
In addition to these clinical treatments, on weekends and in hospital work by surgeon Bwelle also spends nights at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, he said, provided 60 per cent of the funding of his non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Melle, a medical student at Draquelle University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwelle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
"We have been given the opportunity to assess operations where we have helped to remove blood stains or to keep Dr. Bwell's tools," said O'Melle.
As a secondary student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Traveling students usually pay themselves for their travel to Cameroon, often with donated medications.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training are paid by Belle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bvelle, almost constant workload is not a severe test.
Helping others to live happy lives by fulfilling their father’s promise is something that brings him great joy.
“ I’m so happy when I do this work, ” he said.
- And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it so people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's audition.
The Bundestag Deputate Hans-Christian Schrebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was raised whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the U.S.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear, says Hans-Christian Schrebel, that he knows a lot.
And while the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, the conditions for his arrival must first be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are starting to respond to scandals surrounding United States spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and fields.
This was reported to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir MacKay, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davtogle, a correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels have an interest in developing and deepening Belarusian and Turkish relations in all fields and fields.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the two Governments will provide wide-ranging assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” noted Vladimir MacKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for that purpose and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, which had resulted in the signing of the protocol.
Parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and links.
“The whole past meeting has been completed, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners”, he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Duvetog, in turn, reported that in the negotiations the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to undertake various projects.
It was the Minister's view that the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to the $1 billion target.
Turkey was also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, as there was an unutilized potential in that area.
Our countries have always had a very warm relationship, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
It will also create all necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” noted Ahmet Duvetogle.
Obama abandons his words about health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama made a negative statement about his repeated, clear promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading the American society.
Obama yesterday gave some subjugated his original public promise.
“The majority of people with health insurance that works can maintain it,” he said in his statement to Boston.
With regard to what he called “religation in the news” about the termination of service delivery, Obama called on the Americans to seek out other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get better terms,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because they were not covered by the new standards required by the Access Health Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans: you deserve better, ” said Sibelius in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who is in charge of the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said that launching the Internet sales site has been “very bad” since October.
“ I’m upset and angry, ” she said.
“I really want your trust back.”
Dr. Sibelius dropped off this phrase, which caught the recorded microphone sitting behind her to an assistant at yesterday's House hearings, after a heated debate with a member of Billie Long, a Republican from Missouri State, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of listening, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the “architor” of the law on affordable medical assistance did not voluntarily abandon the government-sponsored insurance for the acquisition of the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Resbalt Agency has been dispossessed of media status for non-censorial lies
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to deny the registration license of Rosbalt.
At the expense of the media agency, Rosknadzor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to publish counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Rusbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the years that followed, the agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Agency offices also operate in the former USSR countries.
Rasbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency since 2001.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognized private Internet agencies in Russia.
The Rusbalt has always been concerned with a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and are still) notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of publications to power structures continued throughout the existence of an agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a vast base in various departments, it was also suggested that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherquesov.
The role of Chaplina in the Rosbalt manual is not clear to the end, most often referred to as the project manager.
The agency’s director general is Larissa Afonina, the editor general, Nikolai Ulyanov.
Rasbalt has not been in federal media ratings recently, either on the quote or on the audience.
In October, the agency took a 25th seat in the Russian media website rating on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), about three million unique visitors each month.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the notes of Kremlin's powerlessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the Colosse group's soloist and the jokes in the Birulev capital.
The "Roschallata" conflict with Roscnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law had entered into force that prohibited non-censorial lies against journalists.
The website found the prohibited vocabulary in two video videos published on the site (Gigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers).
The rest of the parties are described differently.
Roskomundnadzom based on discovered videos accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested that a licence be taken from the agency.
In Rosbalt, the Department's claims were not valid: first, the video was not editorial, second, the term was masked, and thirdly, immediately after the sign of the video was taken away from the site.
The agencies appealed against Romannadzor's claims in the World Court, and on 22 October 2013, Mosgorud accepted the Rosknadzor's claim, the proceedings were still pending.
However, 25 times as far as the justice of the world has decided not to favour Rosbalta: the chief editor of Nikolay Ulyanova found him guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 for every video.
Obviously, this led to the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorde, if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been preceded even earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to declare invalid a certificate of registration for "Rosbalt", in fact depriving the media agency of its status.
You can't say "Rosbalt" remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported members of the Gosduma (named to the head of Roscnadzor Alexander Jarov on 10 October; document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRF).
The illegality of closing the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Lord Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Journalists Union, Paul Husev, and Michael Fedov, Head of the Presidential Human Rights Council.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskinadzor leadership even gave him some assurance that before the license was withdrawn, it would not work.
The Rusballt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed the chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capabilities, and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first stage of disarmament in Damascus ended the day before the deadline.
Until 1 November, Syria was required to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of warfare-to-use toxic substances, which were transferred to Bi-bi-si.
The destruction of stockpiles of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after over 1,400 people were killed in the vicinity of Damascus on 21 August during a chemical attack, according to U.S.A.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from carrying out more chemistry - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their deterioration.
Next step, mid-November: By this time the OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are lots of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who's going to provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly verified by Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors of new facilities for verification if there were grounds to suspect that Damascus was not fully established.
It is estimated that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or bring into service all capacity for the production of projectiles, toxic gases and liquids and to fill the projectiles.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing Syrian army chemical.
It is expected that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisoning, a single explosive mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities must agree on a two-week timetable to begin.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, said to Bi-bi-si that his inspectors “observed the destruction of equipment”.
"They are now unable to carry out further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that projectiles and poison plants were either destroyed or damaged.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as it appears in the document, but the equipment was transported from there and verified by the OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical production infrastructure was “especially difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW had received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, the inspectors had not been allowed time to celebrate it, but they were too busy to do so.
John Kerry says in her unprecedented recognition that the U.S. spy “has gone far away”.
John Kerry showed a relaxing of U.S. surveillance tactics, in unprecedented recognition that, in some cases, U.S. spying “has gone far too far”.
The Secretary also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on the autopilot” during the outbreak of the loud disclosures of Edward Snouden about the spy activity of the NSA.
These leaks of information put the U.S. Government at the center of diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video links at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are taking place in the automotive industry, because such an opportunity has already existed, both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course, on 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. Government to admit that the U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone far.
The President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to people, and he is now undertaking a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted with good motives and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is radical extremism, a reckless and complete determination to kill people, explode and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented the collapse of aircraft, the explosion of buildings and the killing of people, because we have been able to know these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of the State of Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the frustration with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of national security, it is indeed important for Europeans to remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the Democratic Republic of Murphy, who has served for the first time and is Chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee for International Relations in European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
The news that the NSA had collected millions of telephone records in Europe had worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency’s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies had gathered and shared with the US.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored Germany's mobile phone by Chancellor Angel Merkel, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, protected spying against allies as necessary and said that it was a normal matter on both sides.
Against this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by Congress members, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both Chambers.
The names of other relevant legislators should be spoken in the coming days.
He said the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “best motives” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they had used for years.
“As long as we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should be sent to the Middle East and Poland for this weekend to address the issue of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to the United States intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of the public observation commissions, the influence of jailers will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (PP) can approve the new composition of the public review commissions (ONK) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting version was adopted, the soldiers' lobbyists would increase their influence.
The SNC is a public institution that controls conditions of detention in places of detention.
The Serge of the Magnetic and Leonida of the Razage and the riots in the B.C. -- through the NCC, most of the resonant accidents behind bars are reported.
The control of the NNC is being carried out between human rights defenders and members of the armed forces lobbies.
During the meeting of the OP working group on the development of NCCs, I suggested that the selection of human rights experience be based on the criteria.
"He wasn't accepted, and he was setting up lists without drawing up the criteria," says Valery Borchev.
The current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the All-Russia structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues, has gone through.
As a member of the Gosduma, he has drawn up a law regulating the activities of the NNC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the PNCs in 43 regions of the country.
For 1,800 vacant seats, less than thousands are claimed, and for Ingushetia and Cabarino-Balcara, no competitions were held owing to the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to provide vacant jobs.
The NCC of Moscow is one of the few competitive commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20 participants.
According to Borchev, the current composition of the Capital Commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 militants and the PP ballot version changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to visit the Commission.
However, a representative of Váceslav Kalininin's "Feral Brotherhood" may re-enter the new composition.
He had been a member of the NCC for three years but had never visited prisoners.
Controversy believes that the activists, by appointing their chairman, would be able to make the work of human rights defenders impossible, so human rights defenders did not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the advance of the forcesmen is coordinated by an NCC member, Anton Tswekov, head of the Russian Offices, an organization that defends the interests of the power agencies.
"I don't eat babies in front of the line," said RBC daily Antonekov.
He denied that he was lobbying for any movement of the lists and said that he did not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Colorkov, he was not even interested in which list he now voted in the OP.
He considers the public to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change in the leadership of the Czech NEC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the local commission leadership had ignored the prisoners ' problems.
The RNA can move from human rights defenders to members of the military.
From the new lists, a human rights defender, a local commissioner, was missing, but one of his opponents, even though in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for his ineviting behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Commissions of Borchev consider “the city for the Copeisk.”
The disclosures of Hope by the Toloconics did not affect the NCC Mordavia, which is considered “forced”, only one human rights defender wanted to be in the new composition, and she did not even accept the competition documents.
The member of the OP Council, Nikolai Swanidze, told the RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because of his outrage over the situation in Moscow and Ross-na-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Paul Gousv says he voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
Under-Secretary, OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute, coordinated the preparation of the lists of NCCs.
The Grib told the RBC daily that it was not the right thing to divide candidates for human rights defenders and the abusers, nor did it agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to prevent the work of its members.
The mushroom is not expected to predict the outcome of the PP Board vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be issued in the coming days.
An Australian woman lodges an appeal against her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days of prison on Phuket Island for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi, appealed and was released on bail.
Steve Rochelle Bampford was originally found on 15 June by the Phuket provincial court guilty of filing a false action following a report by the Thai police that a local taximan had attacked her on Sunday, 10 June, while the other two men had held her back.
However, video cameras later found out that she had returned safely to her hotel after a break in her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket Police questioned Bampford for two days before she confessed that she had fabricated the story.
Before trial, she was kept in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment at the general regime detention centre in Phuketa, not in adult women ' s prison.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League player, Peter Tanx, who addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to her daughter.
Tanx told Sydney Sunday Telegram that the entire family was “very concerned” about the well-being of its daughter and waited for her return to Australia.
“It is obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope it will safely return home as soon as possible, ” said Tanx.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail in 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently taking her leave in the Krabi resort zone in southern Thailand.
Thai legal sources reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuquet, but warned that an appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence of up to two years and lead her to serve her sentence in adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian tour agent Michel Smith in Phuquet, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, which will result in an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris for a presentation of his novel, Eltashev, translated into French.
Remember, this novel is the finalist of his four prizes, "Food Pole," "Ruska Booker," "National bestseller" and "The Big Book."
Last year, the writer of the book was awarded a cultural award by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosthetics.
Virtually every publication of his hard, modern - day narratives and stories is a source of heated controversy among critics of a wide range of ways.
It may be argued that the combined articles on the prosthetics and publication of Senchin, reviews on its books and magazine publications have created an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In discussions about “one of the most controversial contemporary writers,” says criticism of Sergey Chorinin, most of the talk is that its participants understand the word “the literature”, which we see present and the future not only of our words, but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
The analytical and review articles are generally reduced in the “Absaqsa” sections
