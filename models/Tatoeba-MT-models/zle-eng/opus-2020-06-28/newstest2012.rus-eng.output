Parliament does not support the freedom amendment of Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in its amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning the leader of the opposition, Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas transaction with Russia, which was found to be of little benefit.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timothy in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge; the process in the West is also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, whereby the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes for ratification.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
The time has come to identify the winners.
Islamists are generally defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Shariat Act, which we have heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the penalty for theft is to cut off the hand.
Women may forget of emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator ' s society of rival clans, the Koran will be united.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot imagine and which is unlikely to want.
At any rate, our way of life is not the only way of life, nor is it the best, and most likely, the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that they thought NATO was not the American General, but Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every attack.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, we served Islam, and our policies escaped the dictator, their political ally, with no guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon Libya ' s military occupation.
The local population, therefore, need not be concerned about the expulsion of “cross-Northians”.
Although without occupation, would the oil companies receive ink gold from Libya for little or no use?
The West will probably not get it, and the West will finally be able to take advantage of the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless that's the end of Shariat's followers.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe now focus on investors.
A statistical storm struck Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have released GDP data in three quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stalemate, Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market beats record today.
Investors are not alone in Italy; they now focus on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone Statistical Offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have made their preliminary estimates of economic development available in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the second quarter, where German cases were better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent), and France reported a small decrease of 0.1 per cent (the original information anticipated to be stable).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Bureau of Statistics has confirmed a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stalemate compared with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both Eurozone and the European Union has shown an increase of 0.2 per cent compared with the previous quarter, which is consistent with the projections of analysts.
Greece ' s economy has demonstrated a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
The revenue of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The profitability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last creditor to be able to save the situation.
The Czech Congregation was selected for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully met the most challenging task of the season!
Because of Chech and Peter’s beautiful nakedness, they conquered the account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was fortunate enough to maintain a significant advantage after the home match, and it will be back in the European championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and produced a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first secret and big luck in the second.
Czech national assembly, partly due to the defeat of the command at the end; the great Cheh; and the heroic Yiraček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the graduation of the European Cup.
The good defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianović and the Teacher became the most unfortunate pair of games after they lost two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national assembly will not miss the European championship next year, and Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
Since the first few minutes, the game has been very tense.
Both teams had difficulty performing combinations; they played for most of the time at the centre of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the boss's team in the first secret, and further attacks on the defence line were picked up by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have established a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon the student’s prayers before entering the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to defend the nuclear programme of their country at the cost of their own lives.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all showed that Iran had not abandoned attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
Possible attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran were discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon the prayers of students before the entrance to the Isfahan Uranium enrichment plant were followed by a lightning about the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives would be, according to the Israeli press, installation in both Isfahan and Nathanese, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Feeding of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast or colbas for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 fall into greater weight; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families that lead to an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of surroundings and patterns of behaviour associated with man for his or her healthy development.
For example, colbasa appears almost twice the number of children with obesity on tables than in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children who suffer from obesity at the fries meal on the eve of a survey of the educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, families of children with obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern school - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents find time for sports at least once a week.
A study was conducted among 900 children.
The study took place at the end of the last school year, with nearly 900 pupils attending primary classes throughout Bohemia.
The Ogitation event was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Vcheobáná zdavnotí pojihadovna and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 school students from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sporting loads are major determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer either from excessive weight or from obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they were eating five times a day, in a breakfast-creature scheme, and that's one of the indispensable conditions for eating the right food," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunches and colbas at night
Experts warn that even relative details such as family breakfast are important to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
The worst thing was that every tenth family doesn't have any breakfast.
And still breakfast is the foundation of the right day-to-day diet.
The study found that hot food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is more than double - up to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Leave your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“The early days in Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of healthy nutrition”.
Their favorite meal includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet, cool drinks,” states the final part of the study.
As the main dinner dish, the paste won the bird with a small overhang.
However, children have little or no interest in beans, fish and vegetables.
Seeking a Healthy Life - Styles
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits, provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the monitoring team have demonstrated a significant shift in preference towards healthy food when they fill out the questionnaire after the lecture was completed, that's not an accident”, says the project.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks, more children preferred just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children noted more frequently birds and fish, limiting the number of sweets and bakings.
Stilist must also be a good psychologist, claims professionals
In the first article on stylist training, I visited the amount of information I had in the introductory sessions.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures from three experts in this field; advice on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and seminar on how this works in real life.
More, more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical assignments await us.
Training goes on every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alainka, the director, (no man at all) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not exactly symmetrical.
In one short neck, another boy’s figure, without proper shape, weighs even more.
The syllabus should know how to negatively reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add missing volumes.
We were advised how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, who had more breasts and thighs and a narrow talicia, without wearing them too much.
For example, if the difference in the size of the talicia and the thigh is so large that you can't get a cup or a pair of pants, you should have at least one thing in order.
You will certainly not regret your investment, since ideally sitting clothes are meaningless.
You'll feel a lot better in a jubber, you'll be in a lot better than the one who's always going around, who's going on, who's going to roll, wear a talent, etc.
The owners of the boys' figures, on the other hand, may wear clothing with peaches, appetites, embroiders or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the type of figure, I am glad I have a whole week to understand.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two sets of courses for any fame: one day and evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress, and their type of shape.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know on the Victoria's Secret ad campaign.
I enjoy myself because it's much easier to wear than to say, Britney Spirce, Cristina Aguiler, who's recently recovered by a ton (I'm sorry, I'm exaggerating), or quite young Celane Gomez.
We have to cut off the clothes from magazines or find it online, print and process them with graphic programs.
Wisdom is called the result of work - then it reflects our own style and our attitude toward the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic composite style in the head.
Stilts not just dress real people but create food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camennik told us.
But that was only Sunday.
Stilt Needs Common Knowledge
A Saturday lecture on the shape of the figure gave life to three specialist guests in this area.
Stilist, Honza Poconna; fashion designer, Jakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-school can be worn on top of a pair of jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be carried on a bare body, without a stick, like a dress.
Another option is to roll a sleeve or lift up a collar, and the entire image changes completely.
"Do play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I'd like most of the advice: "For your work, you have to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jakub told us.
Here, I finally realized why we're teething all definitions and rules, which is to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, photographer, I found out that the stylist must have more options in place than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 times), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a very different way than in reality.
We should be aware of this when we create an image.
Honza Poconna has confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a striking glamor, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The relationship to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic remains quite cool.
Even well-known people often find it extra (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, or what they look like in a second way).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size (less) than what they actually wear.
And then we go to Google and we figure out if the tabloids wrote something about something that's some famous as a ceiling/frozen, etc.
On Sunday, Honsa and Mario emphasized that for the stalist, it was not enough to know fashions and be able to get along.
Our work consists mainly of communication with the people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to make them ugly, and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some nice things, you can't throw out her whole wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"You can find at least a few things that you can commend, and tell them you can wear with them," Mario says.
He also showed us that a working bag should be specifically placed.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, sticky bells, or English pins, it must contain nylon thread (the staves use it in the removal of certain items such as bags or hats), special clips to bind the cloth on the back if the clothing is too large (the clothing and similar items are prohibited because they are turning the clothes) or a set for the neck.
To get rid of the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to do the right thing to do on the top of the shoe.
Even during the studio, where the floor is smooth, the ashtrays can get damage -- not to mention street surveys.
And here we go with a sticker.
You don't have to touch a scissors shoe to keep them out.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario commended my work.
I don't really care about those skills.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stalist is not as easy as talking.
V Need for welled: Run is happening in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk has turned into a routine morning work trip because of a series of gross errors and negligence.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do extra jobs.
Until the new version of the sub-heading, Run had high hopes.
It was expected that she would give up the previous series of Need For Spied in a new direction; the demonstration shows showed that the game would take a decent place in the race games gendarmerie.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the hero comes out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the end result is quite different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is that there are some unnecessary mistakes in this series of years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained line of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story that Jack, the chief hero, solves some personal problems by engaging in an illegal race through America.
You're in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
There are some interesting features in this idea.
The route consists of 10 phases, divided into more than fifty races.
That means that each race is going along its own route, that individual stages go through different and interesting surroundings.
There is no feeling, therefore, that the game is always going on in the same way.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to see some of the tracks.
Still, playing doesn't make a lot of emotions.
Although driving across the desert, the autumn suburbs or the snowcapped mountains are pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time gives life to an unusual detail.
For example, in the wilderness you are caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains we need to be careful not to fall into the valley.
Individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you've been trying to chase a few rivals (in fact, a regular race); then you're trying to improve your time (a standard race with a seconder); or you're fighting with one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time, you attack the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
Components outside cars are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs away most of the time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game, because it's not boring; given the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more active.
The mining model follows previous models.
That means it's no longer special, but it's not an option.
If you're looking for real life simulations, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
Yet, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far it's very good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the model of collisions is not so good.
You don't expect it to be a difficult game to change and fight, but if you don't know how your car will behave before you're confronted with an object, something's wrong.
Usually, by pulling or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another machine, but sometimes in almost a similar situation, your car begins to fend off.
Or I've broken up a little bit.
It's not that important because of the restarting system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are so arranged that if you break up or go far off the track, the game returns you to the point where it's broken.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you're using them all, you're going to have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if you don't get something, but you can't rely on it.
Sometimes it is not enough to restart, and you must try to visualize a particular section of the race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be taken in a certain way, or you just won't be able to fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
It's especially annoying in situations where you see your rival passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you're doing there, the machines are already in position so that you can either drive them or drop your speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's all arranged that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you will find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival chases you at the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand before you no matter what.
The point is that when he goes in front of you, he's making you lose your vision, which leads to one or more accidents in that area.
You can understand an attempt to make the game a more interesting and sophisticated adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's rapidly starting to cause annoyance.
Too bad, because despite the simple model of driving, playing is fascinating and sometimes so exciting because you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what it doesn't let you miss, a concept with 50 unique tracks, a sequence of race or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas station because it's where your car can switch, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for direct tracks of highways; and exotic super-adversariers for technical driving, for example, on a busy mountain route.
Main mode is closely connected to challenge mode; it is an individual site race that you will recognize when the game is in progress.
Here you're getting yourself involved in your personal business, both medals and glasses, common to challenges and story regimes.
Many possibilities are available for higher driving: from cars to end profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog feature, which compares what you have achieved with that of other players, and communicates with the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car are falling into a subway tunnel (let's say yes) where you go down the rails in the dark (let's think so).
Your pidometer shows figures ranging from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say yes) when suddenly a subway train strikes you from behind, turning your car into a scrape.
For a few days, we discussed whether, during the game creation, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really viewed us as such.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video is mostly pleasant, sometimes amazing.
Although it is regrettable that in some critical moments the quality of the record is sometimes quite low, it is sometimes lower.
This is especially true of accidents involving a large number of participants, where good recording would not help you in particular.
The sound's fine; the sundreek's good for the lover.
In order to please as wide a youth as possible, there's a combination of different styles in the Suntrek, but it's unlikely that many people will buy games because of her music.
The overall impression of Need for Spied: The escape is pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Running is the best part of NFS over the past few years.
In any event, play leaves the feeling of being incomplete.
Of course, it's a good fun time, but prepare to see the flaws as an airport searcher.

EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of the unwelcome and sceptics against the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon caused considerable differences between individual organizations”.
"I didn't expect such a brutal war to happen."
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, and all the players will get used to their new roles,” Ambassador Milena Wizenov of the EU began his lecture in the Faculty of Law.
It has proved to be true in the first part of its lecture on Europe, in which it described individual EU institutions and relations so easily and understandablely, that many of the TC law teachers would be seen.
Moreover, Vicenanova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Hermana Van Rompeea:
"At first, critics said that he was an ordinary grey office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was struck by how well he had dealt with his role."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries simultaneously, communicate perfectly with them and who has a clear idea of what direction EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position as the representative of international relations and security issues as a response to the question, "Who is the European Union, what number do I need to call?" that is, as an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
The stage further focused on the EU's past, present and near future programme.
She called the successful Czech presidency over the past year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time had been a negative phenomenon that had caused much damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing conflict.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economic, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and less; all of those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she had brought to Brussels: “O Europe, the All-Knowing Language”.
"I really don't like the cuts, the foreign words and the jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people aren't trying to sell curves or round burs, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe — Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be European sceptics; and the people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that there are several factors to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and join me with the Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what about the assembly, again the Vishgrad Group? "and he's not happy about that."
In the future, the Vizenov Union looks forward mainly to new stringent rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, she considered the idea two-fold, if not a more realistic Europe.
"We have countries both inside and outside Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"The first time it was said that the countries that wanted must unite, while those who didn't want to stay away."
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will really be a two-speed Europe”, Visinov expects.
In that regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Hermana Van Rompeii in advancing the rule that all EU-specific issues should be discussed by all member countries, not only those in Eurozone.
The story of brand:
IBM's novel takes place in the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one will probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longitude was laid by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, older.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan, "Dumy!", thus became a stamp surrounding the future of a giant (and also its internal magazine, which ICB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of a corporate culture that Watson has carefully built.
For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a steady movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because he remained true to his original values, although he was not afraid to change everything around him.
In our first 100 years, it has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even greater things," says Samuel J. Palmizano, current head of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of employees in the same way as Bata in the Czech Republic, and IRB staff were among the first American employees on paid leave, insurance from the employer, an elegant uniform and a complex system of bonuss for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same is true for IBM's long-term relationships with consumers.
From the beginning, the company had been using brilliantly talented people, one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which had given it a good choice.
It is consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Rometti, will change Palmizano next year.
It worked for IBM for thirty years; currently it is the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
During the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations arise.
It's not surprising that a lot of ideas are working in a company of about half a million people.
Organization with good reputation
The firm's strong business position is maintained by a strong internal and external image.
"From the outset, from the point of view of IBM's concept, rather than the technological company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve technology-based business problems," adds Joj Kolnie of Forrester Research's consulting company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering and creating a market.
Over a century, IBM, or Blue giant, as it is called in the United States, has become one of the world's largest companies because of its logo.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting - from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents for all American technology companies, and five of her employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a banker, a bank card, a financial scroll, barcode and diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (the first place at Apple) to destroy Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Watch forward
Not all of its products have been tasted by customers and are in the age. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2, the online Prodigy service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on several platforms - if they don't work, she refuses them.
This differs from, for example, its Microsoft competitor, which is based and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Outlook technology
The principal income of IBM comes from services, about one fifth from computer software and hardware in each case.
Whereas in 1990, with capital being twice as small, it was the largest manufacturing company of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, while it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was hit by the current economic crisis for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until then, I think IBM has hurt the current crisis.
Since early 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by a record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have increased steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except your own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from raw knife to space flight.
IBM was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name was "The Distribution of Calculations, Tabulators, Recordings" was rather complicated.
She took up the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was laid down by a merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary clocks, that is, hours that record time when employees come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Randlet Flint, who also chaired the company’s trusteeship until 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then, the manager pulled the founder of IBM into the shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unexplained corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as clear from the name, start-up and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and meats to cashiers.
In the first four years, Watson’s leadership doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost 40 years later his seat in the director's chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson, Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both staff members and IBM computers helped NASA monitor space flights, on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, on the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, IBM line System/360, which was the first computer family.
The classic PC, which defined computer standards at that time called IBM 5150, came into the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computers to Lenovo, a Chinese company, at the same time bought a PhryewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, so that he could concentrate entirely on consulting and high value-added services.
During the past three years, IBM has made great strides in his concept of Smaraster Planet.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned and to improve road and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire business cycle.
IBM's tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country simultaneously located in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research team is also working to recognize speech.
Rohthar's account of his wrong husband:
Yvette, leave yourself a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Rohtarz (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Ivetna Bartoshov (45), she still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but it's not my partner anymore," he explained.
When Darina Rachtarzov’s blood was given in her home by Bartoshov, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Even though she forced Ivet to leave Rzenchan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed his love for her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretended to be at peace with her husband's novel, and now she's finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Rachtarge and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife will not take him with his arms open.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna throw him out."
"However, he will end his days, not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom he ties me," said Richtarzov, adding that she's already separated from her husband and insists only on mutual affections.
As long as Josef has nothing against his wife's rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still functioning; I'm responsible for repairing, gardening, houseing and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don't do any more fasting," said Blesk.
He claims that if he finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette, and I have a full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst of women's habits is, Do they call down on you?
When you ask men to identify some typical bad women's habits, they usually immediately list all of them.
Dear ladies, are you going to know yourself in the following lines, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Stopping
Your second half complains you're always shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop in big sales?
If so, you can think of it as a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for whispering.
But who of you will turn aside from walking in dress stores, looking for perfect sit-in clothes and parables of them?
It may be a shapping and a hobby for most women, but for men, it could become hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too thick?"
"I have to drop at least five kilograms -- maybe I should start doing the gymnastics?"
"You still got me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who're on their own.
Not that you should stop watching yourself, but in a literal sense, many men have allergies about their regular complaints.
Strong sex also agrees that the more such complaints occur, the more women become irritated.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Myth, my glass, my ass cleaning, my ass, my ass, the dust fever, the bathtub, at least twice a week.
You criticize your partner for coming on a clean kafel in dirty shoes; children for the dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window ceiling in a hotel that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “disgusting ”, try to realize that it is not good for you to be extreme; and that your family does not have to have order and cleanliness in its front place.
An unloving desire for cleanness can threaten your relationship as well as the entire family.
Waiting for command
"Break the laundry in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Do not lie on the floor of the container."
If you make your partner's comments a few times a day, he might think it's very annoying.
Of course, your intentions are good, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Scooters
Some women like gossip, insult, and domineering against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, as well as why.
From time to time, we may be let go of gossip.
Let's be frank, that's probably the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, and especially in the women's working group pose a greater danger to their surroundings.
The results of Jagro and Voorache's broadcasts helped Philadelphia win
During the HLC match on Monday, two results of a hockey attack by Jaromira Jagra helped Philly win 5:3 on the ice of Caroline, again becoming the most effective Czech game player.
In both cases, Claude Jira used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared the game's best player.
Two of the match results also belonged to a single player with Jagro Yabu Voorachek.
After the match, Jagro told foreign journalists that he had anticipated Jir's a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he'd kill a Het-Trink."
"I felt it."
"Then you feel things like this," said Jagro, after whose actions Jir had killed a needle at the very first opportunity Fleeers gave.
A little later, the second head of the team also had a "chesh trail."
The closing Harrickines Enemy took over the chess and handed it to Maxima Talbot, who beat between the circles.
Before the first break, a domestic player, Patrick Diyer, reduced the gap at numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second time, he was back on Fleeers.
Especially Gira.
Following his effective performance, Jagra struck down a third goal; the blow was then turned into the fourth head of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the three best," said Jagre, commending his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"My teammates tried to help me all these years, and now it's my turn," added Jagre.
Caroline made the match more dramatic by means of Tumoto Ruut and the Diyer toolbar, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our zone."
"He hit the Shaybee, I went faster, and Reed moved to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him and glad that it worked," described the Lord's impression from the last bare match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
Monreal team defender Yaroslav Schpaček failed to finish his match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period because of injuries to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-track advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of toolbars.
Tomas Pulcan can't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was heartened by a large number of injuries in the rear row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended the match with just one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"As far as it is concerned, we can't do anything about it, but we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the chess out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added defender P.K.Subban
After the 30 attacks, the Czech needlesman Ondjai Pavice helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
Golly Jets, who interrupted the five-point series of injuries, was killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: ?edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at that time were mainly selling tours to socialist countries.
Thus, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic on holidays; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which resulted in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; otherwise, it was impossible to travel alone.
At that time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but they either had to stay in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or with "good friends" on the agency.
And that was not all.
It was necessary to travel to the West, and it was not given to politically insecure people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not freely converted; no currency permit could be obtained (west currency) for travel to the West.
The most common practice of Czechs has been their vacations at home, which has led to large quantities of cottages and summer homes, a habit that continues to exist.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic has thus survived the real revolution.
While before 1989, the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, Czechs last year spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that, until 1989, we were not able freely to visit Croatia's most popular now, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for a visa to be obtained from neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, which marked the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in parks because their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical Czech tourist destination at that time was the desire to bring food (conservatives, sals, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists are finally free to purchase Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which in about 1997 led to another important circumstance.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights by chartering airlines, and compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap owing to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for a visa to visit virtually all developed world countries except the United States, which made our journey even easier.
The next significant development in the history of journeys since the revolution occurred in 2000 and the great demand led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charters have been delivered by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and these winter flights from the Czech Republic will be carried along twelve exotic lines.
About 100,000 Czechs are currently visiting exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and thus our country has been a permanent party to the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in 2008, Czechs had spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they had spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during vacation abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The General Assembly must elect a president, and the threat of demand is coming back.
For about five months, the Czech football team had no president, and there is a risk that the successor, Ivan Hasheka, head of the Czech football Association (FACHER) would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimbourk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which rules to follow.
There will be no balloting for one of the three candidates without this vote.
Yindrich Rahel, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Pitzlik are looking forward to leading Czech football.
He left his post in June, leaving, calling on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Gosek era again caught football in the run-up between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was quite evident on 16 September, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates to the General Assembly were eager to come to the National House in Prague, Smithov, as the negotiations were not limited to the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement as to who was entitled to vote in the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials to whom the credentials had been given.
This time has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and by the rule of law that representation based on credentials is not possible.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been too helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mostly dealing with this very issue.
Presentations on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do I go to the 3rd round and avoid sweat?
"The challenge is whether to follow established standards or to find another model," says one of the vice presidents FA/51/R Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the office of the association.
Based on the model set out in the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received great support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia allegedly agrees to a compromise: to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the highest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the total percentage, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
"There is no less, two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; that would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's argument, and he says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Thomas Páclik's views were somewhat unexpected, although according to the election rules defined by the statute, he had more candidates than others.
"I would like the election to be as much by statute as possible."
"I want to avoid all possible representational foolishness, as in the previous general meeting," says Victoria Plzeen, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he was basically contradicting Pelte.
Helta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimbourk; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fervor will calm down after today's expected national gathering at the European championship."
"Foutball will be back on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says Yablonetz, and of the three candidates, he has the greatest experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Rachel's holding back more.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between Bohemian and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt regulations."
"This could cause another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope that common sense will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, some negotiations were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be reached before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be carried, in addition to others, by Vice-President Dairer Kucher and Reich to Podgorica, did not take off from Prague this morning due to technical faultiness; an alternative was found to take part of the executive committee to the location of the winning match.
Finally, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would like the opposition parties of the strongest sports association in the country to reach agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditworthiness; and the planned general meeting ?STV with a new division of Czech sport following Sazka's financial problems.
The patient takes the lead in the presidential struggle because he does not see the candidate
If before an extraordinary general meeting, the head of football footballers, Plzen Tomash Pitzlik, would have seen a strong candidate who would have met all of his demands for President Futbollah of the Czech Republic's Association (FARS), he would not have preferred high office.
"If I had been a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and not fought myself."
"But they haven't found such a man yet," said the Paclik ?TK.
Paclica's motive for fighting Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Rahill is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged province of the elections, from entering the FAKR administration.
Moreover, the Paclici stresses that if defeated, he will not remain President until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football life.
"I spoke to a few people who could be taken into account."
"To me, it was horrible to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that mind," he said.
At present, the main difference between Paclika and Pelta is linked to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbr, president of the regional football association in Plesen, Berbr, a man of conflicting reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist who can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
The patient thus finds it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Pitzlik.
He suggests that the name Pelta was written several years ago while listening to telephones in the case of corruption; Pelte managed to avoid sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And as we would have looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIA," said Pitzlik, "he now doesn't mention his earlier statement that he's going to sell the Plzein Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Pitzcick wins Thursday, he could present future cooperation with Pelta.
This view is shared by another candidate, Rachel, who was supported by the Pitzlik before the General Assembly in September ended Phoesco.
"He (Pelta) would have been the first person I would have turned to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
'I don't put my nose in anything I don't know,' said Pitzlik, who got a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge's crew led by Louis Macello, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Pitzcick claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he had led a team of Plzein who had celebrated his first triumph in May with his help.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
“To restrict the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which has resulted in a repugnant situation”, said Pitzlik, who did not hide his opposition, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA/51/R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he will lobby at the highest political level for more money to be allocated to sports from lottery charges.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should take up."
"If there are taxes on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they need to make clear where the money goes," he said.
The patient does not consider his connection with the Plzeen Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAKR must be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Apple, and Rachel to the Pragsky Doul.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see the sense of having my shares handed over to someone else's club, once I'm going back in six months," says Pitzlik.
He promised new FAKR rules that would avoid the Electoral Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, a presidential candidate, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was selected, he would fight for new FAR rules to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Prior to the Thursdays in Nimbourk, Appleonts' function remains optimistic and believes that the focus on the electoral struggle will have a tangible effect today's expected success in our football collection.
Until the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to stand his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that the time is right for someone to take the lead” claims a person, mainly associated with the Jablant Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is sufficiently experienced to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"But unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If there were no different ways of representation, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the census of a key civil association document as a false objective for delegates.
"If I become President, I will consider this my personal task, and I am going to take on personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"It is a fundamental question, without which we cannot exist," he claims.
In addition, he says he's not trying to label himself against the background of his rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Reich, whom he valued for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pitzlika, who was constantly critical of Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's been a success."
"As it may be, his attacks were inviolable, and many people were surprised at the methods of his election campaign."
“Another, and therefore some of them are now questioning his true identity”, said Peltt about his competitor; he claims to be true to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his primary weapon to be football knowledge, from competitions at the lowest level to national collection.
The national fee must represent all football.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, beginning with the case of the goddesses or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"Now that I would focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole football game," the 40-year-old candidate said "TK" two months ago.
He then promised that his election to a football head would not entail the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff," was his message of Fear, where the prolonged period of interstellarism was causing a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday delegates will not arrive in Nimbourk in vain.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can cope."
"Foutball needs the trust he can get by finally choosing his leader," says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Rahel promises FAKR's leadership to start working actively
If, at the meeting on Thursday of Yindrich Raichl, the active vice president, he is the President of the Czech football Association, many people in the Association will not be satisfied.
Rachel promises if he's picked up, he'll have a hard time working.
He wished to identify changes in the system and make the Executive Committee members responsible for certain fields of football.
It also promises to solve the problem of the goddesses; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money in football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIA to national prefabricated, professional and youth football events."
"I don't want to say that I'm gonna do it myself," said Rachel in her interview for "TK."
"I am a team player, and I want to delegate authority to the executive committee in such a way that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I carefully define the tasks so that in each of these segments, football takes great steps forward."
"It will probably not be pleasing to many people, because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in football allegedly caused him to doubt his candidature.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any point in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Not least, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"This is the trust I can't put away," he said.
Moreover, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he had started with Haschac.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to end it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could come back to what was before Gachek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what it's unlikely that Myck Pelt's companion."
"He's surrounded by people who engage in football so that he can only be accessible to the elected."
"I can be accused of much, but certainly not of subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everybody will have a good time, not just an elected minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the allegations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Even though many people try to claim otherwise, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
"It is high time to reflect on the division of the second league into the Czech and moral parts, the winners of which would continue the struggle in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three moral groups in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While the leader of the Plzen Tomash Pitzlik Club entered the presidential struggle, Raichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel, "to his success is to save tens of millions of crowns on bad contracts, to negotiate television contracts and to negotiate a lottery law.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the lack of unity within the association.
Affirming that Pelta was “unset from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Patzlica, a strong candidate with what he has to offer.
"There can be no doubt that he did a great job in Plzeen this year."
"If he is selected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashash started without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't have distorted the facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about her rival.
The most beautiful basins in Europe
Get in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest can test the incredible water of Europe and relax the body in the jakuzza after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Meder could not do without one thing during his research tours for the past 18 months: without his bath suit.
On her back in the water, she looked up at the taste of well-formed domes, went to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and loved the carefully restored swimming pools in the style of the archeo.
She hastened to add every basin she liked to her notebook, with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The architect of the Meder architecture examined more than 200 swimming pools, and now gathered the impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden, where everything came from the public pools in Munich to the historic purchase palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Towns.
Its “transaction into the most unusual pools in Central Europe” took place through 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and visited the baths in Italy, Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of purchasing culture.
She feels very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but everything's different in the water.
The only flaw is that navigation worshipers should tolerate the blue kaffel plate and the smell of chlorine, while the hippos can breathe the ensemble smell of wild forest or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a Vienna-run Merder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The swimming pool and the oils found in the sauna are a healing factor in the baths, because Meder believes that all feelings are encouraged.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take over such labor.
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All of this is reflected in high ceilings, color tiles, and tramplins.
An illustrated edition of the 190 pages entitled “Buy Foods” provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis, and it makes you want to jump into the water.
The Merder Water Plant found some outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
She discovered a rich nitrate of water in a cartel (Mitskz-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with celery water in a bottle - shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasbrán) as well as a magnificent therapeutic bath, such as the 100-year-old Sachini bath in Budapest.
Out of many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a striking view, and you can see the whole Turiche from the dome on the roof, or you can view the snowcapped Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and the steamer has a window that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Maybe the most unusual design awaits the merchants in Langenfeld, and the Estalt Aqua assembly looks like the UFO just landed in the Alps.
During the winter, pairs of three open sinks are raised and appear to be small in the Estalian Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder basin collection did not smell chlorine in every pool.
Many of the thermal baths are smelling like sulphur, the Ardu's purchases in Bequezbé smell so much in oil that you might find it hard to believe you're in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbs in the celery, the water is almost black from the ol's, which pulls into the skin as soon as you're in the pool -- the healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disappointed in her search for beautiful baths, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugacowica, she found that the area was sealed.
The domes prepared by the architect, Dushanbe Jurkovic, were closed in 1902.
When Merder looked into the removed windows of a red-white-yellow building in the archo style, she saw the shirts growing between the kaffel tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, is the Palace of Terminable Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The Bassies have already been completed through three stages of construction, and you will find not only neo-Roman elements of the post-building period in 1844, but also a Mauritanian hall in the Alhambra style added around 1900.
After a careful reconstruction in 1995, the Term Palace, the favorite swimming pool of Iris Merder basins, is not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement that's a skill to combine these different architectural styles," says Meder.
Ducking in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Seculation of agricultural products
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SCEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world ' s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks will be able to make agricultural products like wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Doyle Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were found in a study conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa from Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Shuman, demonstrates that the world’s commodity exchange rates raise prices, and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
Consumer advocates campaign directly against the Head of Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Initially, the rates for goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand and are being exploited at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akermann responded to criticism, and he promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade “necessary is to put a good reputation at risk of being well-known as the Bank”.
According to SCEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Bank, with recommendations for action.
The bank head then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch, Tilo Bodee, took pride in the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "Studys at growing food prices are a flagrant example of how banks are now acting in a mindless manner against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain duty, according to Borde.
"The Bank must remove from the portfolio all the investments that make the cash rates for food prices," said Borde.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or if it's Dougie Bank's reputation."
Akkermann’s quick reaction is surprising first, but the Director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his office.
Donice Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not change to the supervisory board as planned.
Removing the controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he have to care for the costs, the consequences of which will have to be borne by his successor.
Each other would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch's trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis, Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make a food price rate are acceptable to Doyle Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, and according to a study, each other would withdraw contributions that eventually led to speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would think of closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century home in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsowski
The architical history of take-off, fall and happy end: Pavilion of Austria, for the 1958 World Show in Brussels, won the prizes, became a museum in Vienna, became empty and was abandoned.
Now it's being re-opened as an exhibition center.
Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schvanzer for the 1958 World Show in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple, glass hills, bold to express faith in technological progress.
Pavilion Schvanzer won the Grand Dreux architecture in 1958 for his light, steamy steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so well known that he also built a Pavilion of Austria on the next World Show.
Finally, he was famous for the entire world in 1973 for his legendary quadric tower of BMW and her sister - a bowl building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the South Wall Station, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the "The House of the 20th Century" for that reason.
Nevertheless, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to weigh works of art and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna obtained a new home.
The house has been abandoned since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
The architect, Adolf Kryshanitz, has thus far restored the Pavilion, called “The House of the 21st Century” and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
The museum is the museum of Belveder, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, a happy event.
Agnes Hussein Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery, Belveder, in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Husselin Arko, a graduate of the Arts History Department with a brilliant career as a youth who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Modern Museum in Zagreb, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to hold a permanent exhibit of the Fritz Watrubura Foundation, the cafe and the bookshop, along with modern art, and an office building was also to be built.
Strict control of the & restricted budget
Kryshanititz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
It was known, of course, by the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Assembly of Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also attended Schvanzer at the University of Technology, and the Pavilion was a “exclusively important place”, where he attended the exhibition “nearly every week”.
He knew the original design and was aware of the tasks that stood before the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that had arisen during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was a "power eater," says Kryshanitz.
The windows were replaced with glass fronts, reinforced glass glass panes were inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-quality safety glass.
The steel translations of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceiling.
Two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, a falling light well between the building and the street providing lighting - almost a new building, but still an impressive Swanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were kept, and the building was painted in an old red-red colour of protection against corrosion.
The movie theater's the same as it used to be.
All of this is strictly controlled by the museum department and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and was approved by the museum department," says Kryshanitz, pointing to an inequitable shell in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite its limitations, problems, and transformation.
Kryshanitz noticed recently that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough, typical story of "a poply in town."
Such an architecture is not always in place, but wants to “enforce real awareness”.
The 21st century's house is in a very right place, because the city's planning has brought an unexpected fortune, and the fully renovated main station with offices and housing is growing around the Swiss Garden.
The 21st century can be supplemented by the second Kryshanitz building, which is a collection of Francesca von Gabsburg, acquired the Berlin Interim Show Hall and reportedly negotiates with the city its location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Dautsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the removal of trains in winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter trains and trains late.
Referring to the domestic anti-crisis plan, Deutsche Bahn, Bild newspaper reports that by 2015, investments of around 300 million euros had been planned.
Investments are designed to improve the capacity of locomotives and railways even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and engaged staff engaged in snow-spoiling will double, to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before starting work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows from four to five hours.
Rüdiger Ghómbe, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of the trains being canceled and delayed in the winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Durs the last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in the transport of passengers, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have waited for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in providing ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to do much more frequent checks on the ICE trains ' axles after one of the ICE trains broke up at the main station in Cologne.
The Bank will pay millions of pounds of fines in the United States.
New troubles followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director-General of the Bank: The Bank threatens a fine in the United States of America for many millions of pounds.
In the United States, the Bank's past industrial giant has now hit it, and the Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (10.6 million euros) to calm the disputes that followed the bankruptcy in the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Authority for Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses several major banks of using false promises to deceive credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled credit unions down.
"We're glad we solved this problem without the parties to the court," said Mr. Doyle Bank in New York.
The bank did not admit its guilt in the agreement.
The same is true for Cigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses that flow from billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and initiated the case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scottland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Sad mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They're backed by domestic loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble struck the real estate market in the United States in 2007.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long time to live in September 2008 in the crevice of the financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks still fight a storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudrs.
The Federal Agency for Housing Finance (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It blames the 18 largest international banks for purchasing from the American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a deposit agreement of about $200 billion.
The Bank is also facing the threat of FHA prosecution of numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank with headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but not yet specify the exact amount.
Dougie Bank rejected claims as unfounded and stated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett puts 10 billion in IBM
The financial guru Buffet actively invests in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
To date, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his view of investment in this sector.
According to Buffet, he had to know much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investment of Warren Buffett was regarded as a knight.
IBM, the WIT veteran, got now the title of IBM's "sir."
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Buffet, he reported that since March he had purchased an IBM shares of $10.7 billion.
His investment holdings were one of the largest shareholders of IBM, with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had not known about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that had been successful even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
IBM's significant time has been focused on high-income IT services such as date-centres.
The basic foundation of the computer industry, which is now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far Buffet has avoided technology companies.
He claimed that he only invests in those companies that he understands.
and invested, for example, in rail freight transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding of the Merkshare Hatway holds a long list of the largest companies, such as Coca-Cola and Manich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of his own daughters.
81-year-old Berkshare Hasawaya purchased a small textile company in the 1960s, and it built one of the world's most expensive companies on it.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct in making money brought him the nickname "Ocacula of Omaha".
The price of IBM shares increased by 1 per cent before the opening of markets, following the announcement of the Buffet investment.
The Blue giant, also called IBM, stands on a stock exchange of more than $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said that he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Imminent Danger
Following the identification of the “heat in the Tsikkaou”, the Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of "blood ideology," which is now rising again.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have responded to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turk community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-outstanding fears, such as the right-wing attacks on Turks were not carried out since the burning of Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing network now found is of a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The rise of blood ideology?" was the title of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk on the Internet.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informer of secret services and is concerned that the German authorities may be drawn into the rule of law.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded quietly, remembering the victims of racial hatred by a silent pickup opposite the Brandenburg Gate in the weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a German-Turkish political ceremony.
Cooperation between the two countries has been presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a flop. The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary is called one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the murder series.
The German edition of Hürryet did not miss the case either.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Achmet Kulahji's column.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their jobs had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raids were severely criticized by German-Turkish Internetforums.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not thought earlier about monitoring suspects in the right-wing communities.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric: “If they continue to act as illusoryly, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves”.
"It's gonna be the best self-defence."
"The peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened up and on the legality of the punishment," says Selen.
Crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were examples of a world in Germany threatened.
Photographs of burned ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed with Germans and Turks.
No other development showed so clearly to the Turks living here that they were exposed to danger and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference could lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes
During that period, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after falling down in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, took into account the taxes the Turks pay in Germany, in their speech,
As if he were determining the value of man's taxes.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has once again shown how the lack of confidence of many German Turks has been deepened since then towards the current German State.
Clearly, what needs to be done now is beyond efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal at the University of Zurich
Most of Europe ' s leading risky policy is not in France or Italy, but Switzerland.
The UBS has barely come under attack during the financial crisis and has since been struggling continuously with one, another crisis.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't know he was going to have that part.
In July, following his effective departure from the Head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would start at least an effective post, the President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was quite excited, commended Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for being a renewed strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS was able to make a difference."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Filiger and Oswald Grubbel."
But it became clear in September that everything was going to be different.
Treder UBS in London went through the Bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The executive director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors is considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when does Alex Weber finally get in office?
Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, he will take the presidency in May, not 2013.
It'll be hard for Alex Weber.
He's a professor of economics and a specialist at the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he'll certainly need time for adaptation.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank strategy, which once again proved that he had earned the title of the “greatest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it managed the largest assets in the world -- and for years on the other, it's not coming out of the scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank has nothing to spare.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Up until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Bank connected the image of the hidden and sustainable but also the catcher of assets with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in the investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, with more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and, as an investment bank, entered the League of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, a long-standing professor at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains: "I have always presented to my students the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really very wrong.
Only in 2007 did it become clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the Executive Director, Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to confront the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors, whose services many bankers have been given away recently - one very untapped Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden in such a way that it is not even known.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to announce a new billion losses, and Marseille Ospel, President of the Board of Directors, was retired in 2006 from the Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred, due to a lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic securities for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond to become a shareholder of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences that huge banks had been established in a small country.
Finally, the UBS outcome balance in 2007 was five times as high as the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says banking analyst Geiger.
The second catastrophe came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS surrendered to a tax dispute with the United States and said that he was willing to transmit data to wealthy clients who might have been able to leave taxes with the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, which consists of the recovery of the unjustified business revenue plus the fines.
UBS thus admitted more or less that it was a tool for tax avoidance.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich customers -- the curtain of secrecy.
The Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as it used to be.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors have since resigned, and
Clients' money started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - investment because of failed speculation and the management of assets through aid and the promotion of tax avoidance.
And it just calmed down, and it started to seem that UBS was able to break the situation, how this disaster had happened to a Trader Aerosist, and a single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed something was not okay at the bank.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The incident with Abodooli made it clear that risk control was not enough,” says Martin Jenssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also had no doubt: “UBS problem is that it does not have a risk-control tool”.
It was the caution of the Swiss bankers for a long time that kept the world's largest assets - not too much risk, but security for money, whether or not the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank locks have become a symbol of inconsolable reliability, like Lindt and Prüngli, symbolizing a refined taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
It's a classic in itself.
The bank's main office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrassa, which runs from the main station right to Lake Zurich, around snowcapped Swiss mountain caps.
The buildings are luxurious, and the rental rates are the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss confiserie Spreüngli shops, jewellery companies like Tiffany's can be found here.
The Swiss banks have been there for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credi Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bair.
The strong door leads the UBS lobby.
There are big leather couches across the marble walls, alongside the bank's emblem, a large Saif sign.
UBS knows what his clients need, is reliability.
But the two largest Swiss Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point refused to accept Swiss banking concepts, or they were betrayed by the head of one of the small Swiss banks.
He wouldn't want to see his name in a newspaper like all the Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two largest banks.
He believes that the UBS has become too big -- especially in an investment banking where the Anglo-Sex are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, then they've been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits -- then Phasco -- that no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million carried out the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hasigg in his book UBS Crew.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could I get there?
If they ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is primarily in the amount of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, one being a rich but powered bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin a powerful wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Osperle were a dream team," says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understood model and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, all the way up the way, starting with the intern at the bank."
But Osperle finally relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. He decided that his models were real, says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Proudness is preceded by defeat.
UBS employees are well reminded of the meetings of the board members, where Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
At that time, he headed the “Turniar Table” to which bank successes had been made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do some of this.
UBS was the largest player in exchange and public securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak position, and the parameter that the banking terminology calls the “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS failed in American mortgage products.
To shut up the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in United States substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further, continuing to carry risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out of this process for a long time, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS purchased until summer 2007 when the American Real Estate Market was already in fire," says banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to bring the bank into circulation proved to be more difficult than at first.
Posts in UBS have become child games with chairs and remain insecure until now.
Anyone taking the lead of this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned his back on all the existing business models.
The Geiger banking analyst already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be reduced substantially.
The new Head of Bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubbel.
Over the past few years, he has been able to show character and now, as the Central Bank stated on Tuesday, heads UBS on an ongoing basis.
Ernotts are planning to return the investment bank by the time it was in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to earn money?
These questions certainly ask Axl Weber.
Publicly, he still said only that they were looking for an apartment with their wife in Zurich.
Next year.
The fears of recession in Europe come down to the American Stock Exchange.
The impending recession in Europe had worsened the mood of American investors early in the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The fall of industrial production on the continent has soared the hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the early stages.
The overall relief that followed the change of Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
Euro fell in relation to the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered to be half-full, not half empty -- but now the problems come out again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Monomey Scottt.
Financial exchanges, among other things, stood on the sales lists.
Down Jones' industrial index was closed to 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometers varied between 12.027 and 12.170.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 point, falling by one percent.
Nasdaq has lost 0.8 per cent by selling 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and adapted to the end of growth.
Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September, companies had made two per cent less than in the previous month.
This message was blown up by American investors in skeptics. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to slow down rapidly the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
In an interview with CNBC, the legendary investor Warren Buffet said that it was not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do what was needed to end the crisis.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-long principle into the garbage basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM in excess of $10 billion was raised by nearly 1 per cent against trend during the bidding of the shares of that older company.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 per action and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.
The price of his investment company, Burkshir Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank turned into cash almost all the remaining China Construction Bank share into cash, paying $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its capital quota with net sales profits in order to comply with tighter standards.

Industrial Gates Fill the Cities
The play is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of cities.
Some people love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the gates for centuries were part of the urban landscape, but people complaining about dirt and noise are getting more and more.
However, a solution to the bird problem has not yet been reached.
At the first symposium on crows, in Lear, in Eastern Freysia, experts argued that the fragrants could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
The conservatives argued that the roots of urban problems were the migration of specially protected crops, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The care, expanding construction and cutting of traditional tree nesting has complicated the lives of birds.
The gates are protected.
In Zest, Westphalia, and north-west Jever, Dipholce, Achime under Bremen and Lere have large colonies of over 600 parents.
A number of plans to shoot the crows in Lere led to angry newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the fishing of birds as a special cruelty.
"No ordinary movement and dispersion give anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clewer of Lear.
The crashing of water or tree scars is often undesirable, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Living is scattered, and large colonies divide and extend to other areas."
Disappointment is possible only in the form of an exception to hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them and get rid of them is not an option."
In isolation, urban problems will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of birds from those in need of protection and their return to other areas could be a way out.
"Informative panels instead of benzosil" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and Ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Juggens was one of the founders of an educational gate route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information panels provide information on life in very subtle ways.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Juggens also expressed his opinion about complaints about bird noise. "Shumes a lot of information, and they have to say a lot to each other."
In fact, the birds ’ minds and smiles have come into legends, and the play is often used not only by the tools to take over a bit but also by themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of a bird's mind on four grand.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to knock on a blackboard to get their larvae.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the rock that they needed to make the blackboard.
In another experiment, comparative players had to solve a more complex task.
Researchers put a little veterinarian with a larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get a bullet.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and use their hooks to pinch the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four goggles have done it since they first tried it.

Following the attack on Elder Postigu at the Bosniaks' lockup for 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was funny and showed him a yellow card.
Streek also sentenced the doubtful board to play after Fabiu Quantran - Misimović used it.
After the break-up of the European ceciones in 2004, the bill was fixed with four more legs.
Peter Yirácque has scattered all remaining doubts about Czechs for the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions go to Europe’s championship on the fifth consecutive occasion.

The winning goal was just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, soccer happiness was not enough in Zagreb.

The Turks have almost been able to get a perfect start in the eyes of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stadium.
Seljuk Inan's first shot was on the stand, and Kazim Kazim's attacker was unable to pull the ball off the net.
Croatia then woke up and became increasingly involved in the control of the games.
After the break, the Croats continued playing in excellent shape.
The Legionaries of Bundesligi Daniel Pranici (Bawaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintrat, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukicz from the Wolfsburg team, which gave way to Ivan Perishich of Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattons are going to Europe-2012.
Irish in Dublin celebrated their first exit to Europe after Germany in 1988.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China over the next few years.
The Dax company reported on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.

"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
The busy and very good new book by Peter Engleunda, "The Personal History of the First World War," begins a long list of actors from whom the heart freezes.
Here is the advice to read on this matter: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close as Mr. Engleunde reigns, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse at a moment when, like one of these men and women, you run off the road and you lose yourself in the mist of war.
Mr. Engleund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book that he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely as "the anti-history work."
There are few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, catching journalists or discussing tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains, how much "the record of what it was like," it's about "the senses, the impressions, the experiences and the condition of the spirit."
The book "Crasta and Tream" brought together the experiences of the military years of 20 more or less invisible men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone's going to go prisoner, lose his hand or leg, go insane or die.
Their lives are dead here as church candles: new ones add to the multitudes of others, and some are being burned at this time.
The book of Mr. Engleunda -- withdrawal from the Standard of Historical Books.
It is also an amendment to the belief that the first world war was only a heavy, fossil war on the West Front.
The "Crosses and Prosperity" is an effective panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in that book have beehived hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unreserved problem is tsetse flies.
It's a fascinating book, almost right from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, like Hurricane Catherine, smelling ashless dust.
When you hear a canon, and you're a woman and you're at home with children, you stay there, or you run away?
Either way, who's that?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
"Sufficient of facts," observed Mr. Engleund, "is filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, constancys, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
The "Cross and Prosperity" tracked the fate of people like Florence Farmbor, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stupampe, a young sailor of the German High Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other published materials.
Their lives may be terrible or exciting, but they are extremely alive thanks to the small moments and abstract details gathered by Mr. Engleund.
Many of these are deprivations and how they can be dealt with.
When he tells the story of a German high school student, he says, "Eraz, this is the era."
"Replacement, counterfeit aluminium, dirty rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about the food in Germany.
He describes “the meat of pressurized rice, which was fried in lambs with fat (and adorned with false bone made from wood); the tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; and the shoes of a tree.”
It notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat permitted in the production of colbutas, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories speak of honour and courage.
One U.S. notices the struggle against cruelty and says of war: "You feel that this is what men were created for, rather than sitting in comfortable chaires with cigarettes and whiskers, a night newspaper or a best-seller, and argue that this display is a civilization, and under your granite shirt, with its backs, does not hide a barbar."
The British soldier, on the contrary, observes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person comes to terms with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it's going to happen in front of the public," he writes.
But on the contrary, it's almost like "the conscripted man who's been hanged secretly."
Other comments relate to old Europe, which is falling apart, and to new kinds of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economic competition," writes Mr. Engleund, "war factories."
He points out the coming of one who is called “a new sight in the impotence of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-serious suit that makes a cutting, sitting at a written table”.
Humans act in an unforeseeable way: Low - tech acts as much as heroism.
Mr. Engleund described soldiers who had tried hard to shake themselves from prostitutes with a venereal disease in order to avoid serving on the front lines.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea dung, which soldiers bought and embroidered on their geniuses in hopes of going to the hospital," he writes.
"All the despairers were able to wipe it in their eyes, which often led to life's blindness."
transferred from Swedish Peter Graves to Mr. Engleunda's pro-p.e. flexible but non-broke, which is fit for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how a war has released “a totally uncontrolled force: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start asking why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassela or such novels as "In the West Front Without Change" by Erica-Marie Remark, rather than exhaustive historical works.
The book of Mr. Engleunda is part of this unwelcome pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in a non-fatal literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he's reached a page with a list of characters, got it out of your hands and lit your matches.
After a previous mistake, a carefully designed raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved.
Night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there was to be least people in the Zukotti Park at that time.
The Operation kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, and the others said they were on their way to school.
The Commissioner of Police, Raymond W. Kelly, was at the centre of the event and his presence highlighted the importance of operations by the Department of Police.
There could not be any repetition of such episodes of the past weeks as the use of the list gas against protestors, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of sympathies of the public to be seen by the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation for the release of the Zekotti Park protestors began.
The authorities were prepared to observe occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randles Island, which was calculated at Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training -- counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of a large number of police officers -- referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise was held on Monday on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came at "the last minute," told a source familiar with orders that mentioned the assignment only as a "training."
"The few cops I know and who have been summoned to this case didn't say they're being sent to the Zukotti Park," said the man who was talking in an anonymous manner.
"The only ones who knew that they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that he learned from the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated before hundreds of protestors, who rushed inside before the appointed time, to hear about the plans.
On Tuesday, officers from various police units participated, including district forces, police teams, who were usually used to control criminal areas around the border.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night the right time for the coming.
"It was right to do this when the worst people are in the park," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Road, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and pre-written announcements coming from the loudspeakers seem to have made many protestors feel ashamed.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply collected their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving protesting time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to witnesses, gathered at perimeters to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Department of Police, said that this was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police functioned and that the police had treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal effects of protestors, including bags, plastic blankets and polyethic bags, full clothing, the Department of Sanitation team followed it, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some of the protestors who refused to leave were taken outside, and the photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main protest team took positions next to the kitchen of the camp, at the park centre.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter took their hands together.
And two people took themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “disgusting public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department, was the highest on the ground.
Phil. T. Plasti, head of department's tracking police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police officers was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they had to enter.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and a quarter south.
The observers saw from these positions that the police were expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuktati Park border.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pijn Street, a protestor jumped to the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, released air from a police van’s tires.
A piece of fans flew out of the crowd at some point.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The union of school officials will apply to the city for dismissals
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who had lost places in the past month, plans to bring the city to justice on Wednesdays, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory due to the disproportionate influence of schools where poor students were enrolled.
Trials are probably the last resort available to District Council Union 37, attempting to cancel dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator of work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as trade union leaders called a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds run by working groups to close the hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically denied this charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, the chancellor of Dennis M. Walcott Schools said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One board member mated, telling him that nowhere in the budget had there been any indication that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the District Board reported that they had notified the Department of Education that a complaint had been brought against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to declare the formal filing of a lawsuit before the Supreme Court of the State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be identified as respondents, and eight temporary workers will be dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a member of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of school dismissals in poor areas of the city to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that the poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronicly underfunded.
He points out that while Staten Island did not have enough dismissals, Upper East Sayda or Tribeki had little schools, 17 school helpers lost places in county 23 in Brownville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to Countys 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students lived in poverty, the search stated: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed its way of counting additional funding for every poor student entering school.
The trade union also claims that school directors could be misled by a notification language allowing the dismissal of working with their parents.
The word “execution” was used in the notification, although the word “deprivation” was used more often when the teacher in the school’s pay statement was transferred to the list of employees whose salaries were paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six focal points for work with parents have been dismissed”, says the draft lawsuit, “and not simply translated”.
Mission completed, Congress ready for agreement on Libya
Republicans and democracies on the Capitol hill seem at last ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All that was needed was to make the rebellion go away, the long-standing dictator Muamar al-Qadhafi was captured and killed, and the United States intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) along with the senators John McCein (republic, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for a good revolt and the United States forces for "responding".
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country,” said Kerry.
“It is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, both party legislators argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the United States Army in NATO missions in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and did not apply to the Senate for a vote.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also failed to support a proposal that would cut the financing of the United States operation in Libya.
It left an American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory -- when Congress is quite irritated to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to really knock the ground out of her feet.
The events followed by the rejection of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Kaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially concluded on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “encourages the Libyan people for their unbelievable courage and unexplained steadfastness in their quest for freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who have participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unexplained courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Would new measures fully support the Foreign Affairs Board or divide legislators as the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader of the Committee, spoke against the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not seen the last version of the bill yet.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives this week should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the principal legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some democracies in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlatt (republic, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other action to be taken by the Congress in plenary.
Other legislators have not yet been able to amend the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that dealt with a wide range of issues that have been addressed by this convening.
Some were duplicateed - the same bill was made in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 revisions to the balanced budget in the House of Representatives alone, and a further number of “states over federal expenditures”.
Some of them are identical, but they give their authors, mostly newly elected Republicans, who wish to steal their résumés, an opportunity to boast that they have made such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for an amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of Congress members, and the member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (democracy, New York) wishes to abolish the two-year limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Junior (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been offered for many years, as is another prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also want to permit the repeal of federal laws if they are opposed by two thirds of the states.
As members of Congress sought to propose amendments, they did not move faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments and introduced 66 in the 110th.
That pace would follow from the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they have been successful no more than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, the 27th was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"The murderer, but not the winner," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the armed man fired at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (democratic party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday night, caught a tune from the Broadway Sun show coming back and said that he wanted more to recover than to return to Congress.
With the start of the 20/20 "A-Bi-Ze-News" program with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was hard to formulate proposals and needed help when walking.
The program showed her a difficult recovery from a bullet injury that broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on the debt limit.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, where six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called his recovery to the “workers”.
To the question, Sawyer, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, as astronaut Marco Kelly, was part of the time-bound special issue “20/20”, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book “Gabby: The History of Husbands and Hope”.
The Special Representative described the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a head and long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physicists teach her how to do simple things.
Smash your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords made the second word "test," a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by Ai-bi-si shows that music played a central role in Gifford's recovery: we see a congressman spit along with the doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have a Good time" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Patty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she says that she cannot remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he had read a paper in the Gaffords on 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed then.
The alleged attacker, Jard Lee Laffner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Gofffords Sawyer.
"Tough, hard, hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm out."
"And I said, "Gabie, you're not a win-win," said Kelly.
You're only beaten.
And you'll go through this, you'll get better and come back stronger than ever.
The military feel more sorry than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock slept a ballad about powerlessness, frustration, and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marine infantrymen stood around him.
The audience in the tumours applauded his standing.
"The soldiers were watching heroes," said David Zitzman, who had organized a spring fund-raising.
The senior military officer at the concert, who also had the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Amiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the military differently.
"They were treated like orphans," an officer wrote in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted better.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was a pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
The war is a source of praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, they say to the military.
The public is increasingly acting as if he were feeling pity for the people in uniform.
“We are not the victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and was soon on his way to Afghanistan.
"But I think the only way for some to show support is to treat us like an unfortunate one."
It is a sensitive subject for the chiefs who do not want to look down on the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years in Viet Nam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the regrets talk takes place quietly and only between the war veterans.
After his two sons returned from hostilities in the Marine Infantry, the colonel in the resignation of Mark Kenning warned them that the people of the army would not look at them from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with admiration, for they would thunder the rebels and be in exotic places.
Others will wonder if “under Masquei, a wicked veteran”, said Kennva, who fought in Iraq and, when he returned, took up a high government position in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he would be able to withstand a responsible job in Washington immediately after a combat.
Kennva recalls, as he told his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative effects."
The inaccuracies experienced by the military are due in part to the American indifference to wars.
Battles in the battle field rarely receive praise from a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism, as was generally the case in World War II," says Lieutenant-General in the resignation of David Bairno, who commanded the United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the deep suffering of a soldier.
The troops are estimated by the number of moves they have made, by the number of partners they have lost or by the size of the losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters to combat rape
This week, historic court hearings should decide whether a lawsuit of 28 men and women against the army will be filed against the rape charge.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private first grade Elizabeth Lyman 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy, she claims, was raped at night by her fellow worker.
It was October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and met a male attendant carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But a Texas weaner took her anxiety away.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman's room, the man came to her rear, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 current and former soldiers will be eager to wait for court decisions at a historic hearing to take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether they will go to court for a lawsuit against the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, and his predecessor Donald Ramfeld.
The action states that Gates and Ramsfeld have not been able to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The complaint filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 months, to 25 women and three men who claimed that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their employees, and that the army had not duly investigated, prosecuted or ensured due justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted at the top of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also said that about 400 other victims had been associated with her since February, many of whom could take part in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, is to open up a lot of business if you need to keep the pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to put an end to the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek received reveal the defence strategy, mainly the fact that former or current soldiers are unable to file claims by the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for damage caused by military personnel.
“Proposed damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs” is stated in the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from participating in the fighting, this division is only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers have played an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in the fighting zone.
The result was 150 female soldiers killed between the two wars, two thirds fighting.
It's also time for armies to become modern, says Burke.
It is not alone in its struggle; in addition to its trials, three others are being prepared.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academys for the promotion of the women's hate atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American veterans in Viet Nam prepares a lawsuit against the army, at which the “person-change” diagnosis is centred, which victims of violence are subjected to removal from service, a normal phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Organization of Action for Women as a member of the armed forces.
Her team filed a suit against the Veterans Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for pensions from people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills offering a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,358 rape attempts were reported.
But it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of reported cases reached the court, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The leaders in the Burke case refer to attacks as only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it had occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of rape on a separate basis 11 times as a policeman, a doctor, and a commander.
She collected a package of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from the cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was born now, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change, which made her unserviceable.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an adverse language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her research associates is a complex issue, says John Terley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are able to move forward.”
The verdict between them is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been critical of Doktrin Ferres all my life.
The army has been abandoned for decades because it has no incentives or restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "Shances are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when decent people want to fight.
If they fail, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We shall continue to fight the army on this issue until there is a reform”, she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
There's eyes on the wall: As researchers study you at Facebook.
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Buring Bryvik was a regular boy presenting his anti-immigation views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brevik, aware of the massacre in Norway in July, which took the lives of 77 people, attended his first public trial.
Although he could operate alone, he was far from being alone, and he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, including millions of nationalists who supported right-wing groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy, just come on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not difficult to get along with them," says Jamie Bartlett, the leading author of the recently published report on the European cyber-publique of the British Centre for Research, DEMOS.
The provision of personal data on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website’s ads to highlight the scientific accuracy needed by the demographic group - that marketing experts have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, and then delivered a message to them, but instead of showing them a new group or a diet product, it suggested that the user be asked about the level of their education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, they were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries, without even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not so striking: the online members of the right-wing groups, most often young men, who are displeased with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activities with online online activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the light of health issues to social trends that are expressed in Leikka, posts on the wall and status updates.
From over 800 million active users, adding an average of three records a day, Facebook's “supplical information” is creating a research boom by increasing the number of scientific articles called a site in the headline by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"If you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join a party, and they would never have accepted you," says Bartlett.
"Fissbuk forbids all of this, you refer to them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and study social health issues.
The latest study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drinking exploits in Facebook were much more likely to be at risk of alcoholism than students who were praying on this matter.
Morno suggests that students' peers, for example, their hostels, could monitor the website and intervene to help a student who is too often updating his drinking status.
“You can't solve the problem without finding it,” said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children from a group of risks that we wouldn't find otherwise."
Facebook also regularly extracts data on its users.
The site ' s data processing team processed the statistics on relations and Saint Valentine ' s Day, the voter appearance mid-term in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information available only to them), the cyberfree champions long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, likes them or doesn't -- in exchange for a chance to play Skrabble with another one thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for online research.
“I don't think many users would at least think that a researcher can observe their profile,” says Neil Selwin, a sociologist at London's knowledge laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the public page of a student in Facebook.
"As they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
This raises the question of methodology.
Even Offline has no guarantee that the object of the study is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information there is in the profile and in the user page of truth.
"What you're talking about on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two completely different things," said Selwin.
That is why, despite the years of its work in the field of technology research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace getting out into the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"The social studies are supposed to be social, and most of the social studies are still off line."
"Hold and Manless": Anders Buring Bryvik will be brought before a court of justice for the first time
Anders Buring Brayvik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer described himself as a fighter of resistance during the first public appearance in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Rizare Tamplijers of Norway”, he said before 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess actions, but I don't confess guilt."
Judge Torquele Nesheim interrupted Brevika during this monoga, because he “did not wish to give Brivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a space for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brevika, who had brought a speech written in advance, to approach the victim’s relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Brevika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would be in strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking through Brevik's eyes, others just make sure he's locked up.
Everyone has come to find the answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian channel NRK one of the survivors on the Utto.
"It was not comfortable, but it made it easier for me personally after I saw and heard the suspect."
Bryvik's dark suit and blue tie kept calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Brevica's strange idea that he was part of a large resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he was dealing with his accomplices.
Some may calm the fact that the attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a radical group.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but not so," said one victim's relative.
"It would have been much easier if that were the case."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs's lost interview in the theater this week
Following the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, describing the technical geese as the great inventor of Modern times.
But the fact that Apple fans can count the biggest discovery in the recently discovered interview, which was remembered in the run-up to preliminary performances in major markets this week, is how much of this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself hippie, but he was also a touchy organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] the great idea of a big product separates a huge amount of creative work."
Let's go back to 1995, Bob Cringley set up the Triumph TV series on a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, about 10 years had passed since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had been working at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of massive Internet development.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in Nardah, he says that the original interviews were lost during transportation.
Only after the death of Jobs was a complete VHS copy found in the garage.
This film, a little edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, which comes out at Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person who is aware of his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs seems reluctant to present its technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are many intervals between questions and answers in four different contexts -- reflections in 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also moments where Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems to be an irritable question by Cingle, which forces him to move faster into issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In an interview with the Lost Interpreter before the Pixar, the Aids and the Amphonies, there is something ominous when Jobs estimates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
It's one thing to read about the post-mortem assessments of Jobs, but there's something early and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went out and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"For the rest of the time in business, I kept asking, "Why do you do this?" and the answers you always get, "Oh, that's just what this is doing."
Nobody knows why they do what they're doing, nobody thinks in the business very deep.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail its attempts to rationalize the accounts at Apple.
A built-in record of the costs, often beginning with “standard costs”, which were taken from the ceiling and then coming up with “accurate”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business costs up to fines.
About the joke over the Pope:
Jobs tells us details about the blue box that he's done with Steve Woznick, a device that allows people to hack up the phone effectively and call for free long distances.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs's euphoria here, when describing the blue box as an act of power, is contagious.
He tells us how he and Voznick tested the box using a cartel, ordering a conversation, and then connecting an AT&T network to another area until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've covered the Earth's globe once, and you've been yelling at a cartel, and it's got into a neighbor's cell phone one minute later," she says with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could anointed something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could have gravitated a little thing that could control a bigger thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have appeared.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one of the famous outputs that he and Vozniak actually handled by calling the Vatican via a blue box at midnight and asking for Pope’s phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to a United States diplomat, the two broke up with a laugh right before the pope himself was lifted up to answer by telephone.
About technology-loving (and the cold-swimmering of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hewlett in a telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer-end job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It has had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I've seen at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they belong to their employees."
Jobs later became a HP staff member visiting the research laboratories of Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer”.
He was about the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic phone, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write a program for her.
On improvised innovation:
In a few places where Jobs's interviews talk about inventing new products for summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a piece of mounting boards, one buyer asked him to collect a complete computer.
Working only 30 days in credit, he had to think about the assembly and deliver the finished devices.
Later on, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse worth $300], and I was sitting in my throat, and I came out, and I found a designer."
Nine days later, we had a mouse that we were able to raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
On large companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's recovery, Jobs was precisely predicting how many industry leaders would be wrong about the situation and lose control of their share of the market.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerex, so you make the best cop or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any better.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [that's the type of people] who end up running companies, and the people who make the product are being pushed out of the decision area.
Genius, which led to this monopolistic position, is dispossessed by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
That's what happened to the Xerex...
Xerex could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times more, could have been a Microsoft of the '90s...
They've been defeated by a victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a big product separates a huge amount of creative work... when you untie a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about its thinness.
There are compromises you need to go to -- some things you can't make to make electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- those concepts, connecting them together...
In the end, everything is going to taste -- everything is going to try to express itself at the best that people have ever done and then to try to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists dig, great artists steal.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Skylia and Thomas are having lunch with the opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question, whether he would hear the rejection of the law governing the health of President Obama, his two judges, Antonine Skali and Clarence Thomas, read at lunch sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
This happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One case on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states, which challenged the rapid review of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists of the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the round debate of 5 1/2 hours was expected in March 2012, and the outcome was likely to be a disturbance in the presidential race, which would be at the height by the time the judgement was announced.
A lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the health law must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney-General at the time of George W. Bush's presidency.
The legal firm of Clemente, Bancroft PLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped finance the annual lunch of the Federal Society, a long-standing group that constantly champions conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pflizer Inc pharmaceutical giant, who had great financial interest in the outcome of the hardship.
The lunch was held at Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting in the case.
There were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
Have you seen the honors at the dinner party?
There is nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federal Society for many years.
This is not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free of the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were to obey, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The Court may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a distinguished guest or mention in the programme of such an activity”.
However, the apparent proximity of Skali and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for government ethics activists.
“It is a shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the Code that is contrary to the statements of some judges that the Court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Del.
"The land has been drinking and dinnered for a formal fund-raising exercise with lawyers whose cases are now before the court."
Their emergence and contribution to the collection of money for this activity undermines all allegations of indifference and is unacceptable.
Skali and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very eager to mix court cases with those of groups like the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservators claim that this is an ethical question for Judge Helena Kagan, rather than for Skali and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama ' s administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the level of the first instance court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law at that time to be impartial now.
Cahan didn't show me she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18-million-year-old flight order
The Emirates company orders 50 large-scale Boeing 777 ships and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Human Air, the transaction size is over $1 billion.
It's hardly the news that the company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event where this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft, and the price for all those 50 planes is $18 billion.
It's just as important where Boeing received an order: the Middle East, the growing gold lived on future plane orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft at 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing has convicted its largest commercial aircraft equivalent to 50 Boseing 777 in the weekend.
An incredible order came from an airline company called Emrates in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price of up to $26 billion, said Boeing on the Dubai 2011 Aviation.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which could boast of far better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The cost of six planes is more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Oil-producing countries own many Middle East airlines.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, because this is one of their largest objects of expenditure, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of aircraft when prices grow up, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emerrates' order strengthens the Boeing leadership in the wide-fed aircraft market and helps prevent the Airbus SAS pilot from reaching his domain with his A350 airliner.
It was four months after Airbus said that he would lay off the largest A350, which would compete from 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the volume after the buyers demanded that the cargo and range of the flight be increased.
The Boeing Co shares have grown by 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost her election in Michoakana
Louise Maria Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped the opposition Fausto Vallejo of EIF in the election.
The sister, President Felipe Calderon, did not seem to have implemented her application for the seat of Governor Michoakana during the harsh state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to induce a race in favour of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results have been made by the leader in the West State Governor ' s race, called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or EIF.
“The involvement of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoakana, but also for the whole country,” said Louise Maria Calderón on radio interviews the day after the Sunday ballot.
"They have intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... and they have waved the ballot boxes, they have prevented... and they have forced people to vote for the EIF."
IIR managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It is preparing for return, and the victory in Michoakana is an important step in this attempt.
IRE hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valleho seems to have only won Calderón a little, who took the lead in the election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party or the PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Valleho as a winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate from the left of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the DRP now owned by the Governor's chair, came in third, a serious defeat for the divided and failed left to the presidential election 2012.
Aureols also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valleho, former mayor of Morel State, denied ties with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines had long been dominant in Michoakana.
This is President Calderon's own state, and he chose Mikhakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he married Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For EIF, however, as the Michoakana election looks terrible, victory will give the momentum of the party.
The man who was supposed to represent EIP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nyeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term downturn that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two most rapidly developing large economies must “do everything they can” to expedite the recovery of the currency bloc by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “invitely” and said that Asian financial cooperation side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We all care about it."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it may not be inexorable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely hit by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowing funds had increased rapidly, and the Prime Ministers, both Italy and Greece, had resigned.
The European debt crisis had created fears that it could once again lead the world economy to recession, and had led the leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of a EU financial assistance bond, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe, was very powerful in the negotiations for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce of India, said that "India will do its utmost" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have tremendous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warshini, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to assist Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on a dollar a day or less.
"At some point they will find that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and ride for holidays to the sea, and this will not be taken for granted," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India ' s reserves should be used to support Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with “suspensive risks” because of threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to be set up as “emergency plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Struggling warnings to the Pentagon on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Pannett, struck the scene on Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battle fields in Afghanistan along the lines and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already running out of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions of 600 billion or more can be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach agreement on expenditures.
“The effects of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry”, said Pannett in a letter to the senators of the Republic, John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the capacity of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and the resultant so-called sexist had led to a 23 per cent reduction and an end to many new projects.
"This severe reduction, which has been applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building -- and will cause serious damage to other modernization efforts," wrote Panette to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our civilian workers, and as the decrease is done so quickly, we will have to almost surely fire the civilian population in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and seriously damage the fighting."
The reductions were ultimately affected by the military, said Panette.
“Although military funding in the overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the Svets, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the core budgets”, warned Pannett.
“Contracted personnel will be reduced to the end of the cancellation of contracts and oversight contracts that support troops.”
“Staff personnel will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated”.
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of the secede in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power."
“We stand firm against this dragon action”, reported the senators in a joint statement on Monday night, when they issued a letter to the Pannetts.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The witness is a threat to the national security of the United States, which cannot be allowed to happen”.
Whether the letter from the Panette or the latest warnings from senators would lead to budgetary compromises or intensify calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions would be seen later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although he had come to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budget reviews in Congress and the White House, and realizing that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a bad picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless unit."
"It's the wing of the plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out a mission," said Panette in her opening remarks in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that is suffering from a fragile combat spirit, poor willingness and inability to fight potential enemies.”
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
The annex to its letters to McCayn and Graham Pannett described new details of how reductions “result significant operational risks: slowing reactions to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and react around the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future military operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based combat vehicle that the Army and the Marine Infantry are required to replace the Hammer.
The cessation of F35 further development and testing may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats posed by China and other opponents.
How to Cry the Lie
A close look at recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for the Republican President, Herman Kane, is involved in challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party blames the other for lying.
The Pennsylvania University Administration was charged with false witnesses because they allegedly concealed the retired football coach rape boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when at a recorded microphone, Barak Obama told the U.S. President that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Falseness destroys careers and shocks countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet Exbibitist Anthony Weiner made a fool to deny their outputs, which was quickly denied by incontrovertible evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extramarital ties.
And again, none of the survivors at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewanski during his second term of office.
Writing about school and college fraud is a normal matter.
There have been instances in which teachers have provided their students with answers to the tests so as to have a good assessment of their performance.
The teachers, who are to teach the opposite, are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
What is the number of lies we face?
In one day, studies show that you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other’s acquaintance.
Identification of lies or lies is essential for each skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game that looks like, say, a scarade that needs to be called "Survey!", the identification of lies is a strong direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One conclusion of the study is that most old myths about lies have been scattered.
Falses look in the eyes.
They don't always stop, pop, paint, or laugh.
We should not conclude that the liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced liar can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, hints, questions structure and time profiles.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-increasing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that identifying lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviewing, negotiation or management.
The good liars are able to read others in an excellent way, making them feel uninvited by controlling their own emotions and intuitively feeling like others do.
We know from a study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women are more likely to protect one's feelings, that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried ones.
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of your site.
It's called a "definition of baseline".
This helps to provide a starting point for the measurement of changes further.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your site.
It would be good for you to know whether a person is repeatedly kicked into normal condition, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see your feet pounding in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive, verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flanges, not proof of deception.
They can mark the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the door, change their postures in some way, or show them a “measure after interview” -- this exaggerated breath of ease and change of postures, where all the difficult questions behind them are.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation to just look at the relief after an interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have fallen behind and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which has led to her finding all over the country.
Intelligent people can also use distance in their speech: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone might use the "quantification language" when they answer the difficult question, "OK... on the truth, to say... how do I know... how do I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic in identifying lies, but it is possible to learn the skills of detection.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone’s being a victim of skillful jury members in his or her professional and personal life.
The solid oil pipeline plan needs to be reviewed after the U.S. threat of its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, it called for the anger of trade unions but calmed the environment ' s advocates -- the oil pipeline company claims that it would be willing to review the project to resume its work on it.
The Transcanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandy hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still receive approval.
The company made this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of Transcanada Alex Pubras said that the company maintained confidence that it would eventually receive approval for the oil pipeline, although with another route.
This is followed by a statement by the Department of State last week that it will lay down a federal project decision until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of Nebraski's Sandy hills and the Aquifer Ogallah, a vast underground supply of water.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, following the election of next year, although the authorities denied that policy was involved.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the State Department ' s appeal and expressed support for it.
Oil pipelines of 1,700 miles should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transport 70,000 barrels a day from Alberta's province to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to move six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but he is loved by trade unions, who hope for approximately 20,000 jobs related to oil pipelines.
But Nebraski legislators who are opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement of Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation from the area of Sandy Hills and the Aquifer.
The current study of the Department of State on environmental impact showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy source stated that the Department ' s auditor had requested a separate review of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist employed by the Transcanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another option was whether the firm was hired to conduct an initial study that did not work because it was connected to the Transcanada.
Patty La Belle was sued for allegedly causing a child to be killed by fear
A New York family claims that Patty Label's disco-divided Patty had begun to camp in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, intimidating their young daughter to the extent that she was afraid of.
The Tiradi Marmaade executives were scared by the 18-month-old Geneva Monk so much that she moved “the change of personality, the disorder of sleep” and“ the great fear of strangers”, says her family to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This was on November 10, last year when the work scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, the tutor of the kindergarten, Rosenne, and Genevieve were about to be on family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosenna Monk came down in the lobby of a building on the bulvar Riverside with their luggage, just outside Geneva.
Rosenna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?"
LBEL angrily made a saying to a pregnant woman.
She said, "You didn't have to leave her daughter outside the door," said Rosenna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you're saying or thinking."
She got angry and started using rabble -- the word C and the word on F -- in high tones ...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to pour water from the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve had a tantrum.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
La Bella attacked her mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosenna Monk.
The baby cried so hard that she was tired, she added.
Later, the family sent La Bell a note on the apology requirements but did not receive a reply.
Counsel and representatives of La Belle do not respond to comments.
No compensation was provided for the injury, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to contribute any money that he received to charity for children with cancer.
'Cell - force Patty Label to be in charge of his actions,' said Davis.
“This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the child gardener with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate problems slowed down the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario López, there was an increase in unemployment and the illegal labour market, foreign financing had been reduced and the economy had been weakened.
The 2011 - year that will come in the economic history of Sinoloa as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development but, given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in basic economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February not only caused the loss of millions to the agricultural sector, but limited the possibility of growth in the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by the morose provided by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and wool being the main damaged crops.
By November, economic activity had led to a steady rise in state unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, an accelerated unemployment rate was recorded during the first three quarters, from January to March 55.053 the population of Siniloa was unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a proportion which was more than 74,000 persons unemployed in Sinilo, which was 18.969 more than the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinoloa over the course of the year is highlighted by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (USA), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions taken in public policy.
“What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law that was enacted at Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is not easy for people who illegally possess dollars to work with them to invest and use them in something,” he said.
Returned immigration
Lopez Servantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rising unemployment rate.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of jobs abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulty of entry, and in the second, because one day when they get out, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remain and require jobs here in the state, as a result of increasing unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Siniloa labour market is becoming worse if we pay attention to the large number of labour-related violations according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and disruptions, another mention of employment in the state is presented by low wages; the country has the lowest wages, according to the Mexican Social Security Institute records and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinoloa ' s workers was by September 5.352 pesos, much lower than the country ' s average of 7,375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment, 2011 recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state FDI amounted to $630,697, which shows a decline of 87.74 per cent over the same period as $5,14,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Minister for Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mostly came to service companies.
Bottom
In the face of an economic downturn, the state government requested a 3 billion-dollar peso loan during the State Congress in July to be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos had been approved at the local level, and by November, no debt benefits had been expected in any sector of the state economy.
Responses
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez illustrates the lack of capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there was a lack of harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government itself.
“The efficiency of the Sinloa economy this year has been really low, has to work hard to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012, we have to redouble our efforts, we have failed to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, on the good and synchronized work of the new government team, and we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited this year.
“No volume of economics is the result of several events, including the cold, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which is not fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close below our expectations,” he said.
Overview of the Direction
Theodore Slarzar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of employers of the Mexican Republic at Sinoloa, said that the state must continue with its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have discovered that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme that will alter the direction and economic course of the state needs to be mobilized for all the material and human resources that Sinloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the Government ' s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, but there is little progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that there is a lot more to be done,” he said.
He's being convicted for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years ' imprisonment and a 100-day income fine - this sentence was imposed on a Navoyato citizen for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General reported that the sentenced drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of a crime against health, and in this case the possession of marijuana for the purpose of spreading.
According to the case of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrols to Cyprus City of Valdez, prior to Post No. 80 in Castillo, Navoyato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pick-up car, where he carried a black bag in a car box and a small backpack on a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was taken to the Second District Court and the accused remains in the Centre for the Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
There is a need to contribute to the work.
Public works related to programmes such as the Family, the Salvation of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining incomplete or postponed owing to a lack of resources, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes were still under development, they were in danger because the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which the staff should contribute 25 per cent, and that only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for work, so that there could still be delays in completing them.
"They have to put up almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they haven't given us any copies when, since the beginning of July, they were supposed to give us a portion," he said, "so that we don't put aside, we've started our jobs and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so that at the beginning of the period of the municipal administration, it had to borrow more than 7 million, a sum that had not been made available in the case of State administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial capacity to participate, and the programmes continued to develop this year, and in order to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state should have left behind," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made in the name of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarealu, to increase efforts to ensure that interest in them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to make almost 12 million, and even though the year ends, they don't give us any copies."
The Court will approve the “digital television transition” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which carried the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015 because the eight votes needed to cancel it had not been obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including Juan Silva Mesa, president of the Court, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing actions to move towards digital land television.
As a result, constitutional claims made by the Senate have been rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to make a statement on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olgoi Sánchez Kordero, offered to declare a decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme was the law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Moon, and Sánchez Kordero voted in favour of the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support complaints, Minister Sánchez Kordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it concerning the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Kordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive branch could not determine the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not think that, if that had happened, that would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulator”, and recall that planning public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analogous signals with digital signals, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electronic spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponement, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting public needs that have not only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “demand the work of the entire system, established on the basis of State economic governance, include a group of authorities which the Constitution brings together to the State executive power”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the assistance of the executive, despite the existence of specialized technical institutions.
It could not be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion that in any case affected the jurisdiction of the Congress, ensured in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoana, the possibility of counting a "voice behind a voice" is analysed.
The difference between the first and second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of the 6.74 protocols.
The possibility of counting the vote is real, with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoakana, where, according to the Electoral Preliminary Results Programme (EPR), the difference between the first and the second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of the 6.74 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoakana Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragoz, recalled that a set of principles had been approved by the Electoral Corps a few days ago, on 9 November, to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoakan did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Law Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal time limit for their entry into force in the electoral process and the Governor of León Year Book did not include it within the time frame fixed by the law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJC) ruled on a constitutional claim submitted by the local legislature and called the “inefficient and illegal” voice of the state's constitutional reform representative because he was not entitled “to authorize or support them”.
In an interview about the “voice vote” of Maria de los Ánjeles Lianderal, it was argued that with the adoption of the appropriate principles, the IMM General Council would be able to present a partial or complete calculation of the votes of the local electoral body.
For example, a partial miscalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the Ur or he is not in the Chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a general revaluation of votes in all ballots may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winning candidate and those who received the second seat in the ballot is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or a coalition that identified the second candidate.
A general recalculation would also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it was determined that the difference between the winner and the candidate taking the second place was less than or equal to the same percentage, provided that there was a request from the political party whose candidate had taken the second seat, in the case of the exclusion of the ballot boxes, which were taken into account in part.
It is worth noting that this is the situation where there are elections in Morelia, where the difference between the first and the second seats is only 0.16 per cent, even though 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols are not counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalanama, confirming the family.
The remains of Felix Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; and a peaceful Mass was performed on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Sasalanama.
Following the adoption of pain along with other people who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Koauila on board the Mexican Air Force, the closest people were visiting the Campo Marta ceremony.
At noon the regiment’s ashes arrived at a watchhouse located on Nazario Ortis Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, who had been a member of Felipe Basio while he was in high school.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalanaem, he always told his family and friends" is what Sandra Cortés Basio, sister of the pilot.
In her opinion, the colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felix Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to the Aviation College in Sapopan, Khalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a head full of even in the truck, but he always wanted to be a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good person when he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him when he brought Martha Saguang to Saltillo.
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan to give his relative's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died, doing what he liked most: flying.
He is guided by the Last Way

Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he managed suffered the collapse, together with the Secretary of the Province, José Francisco Blake Morea, and six others, all representatives of that Ministry.
At 18:05 remains of Basio Cortés (crete), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to a training school essay, where his family already awaited him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, her mother, her brothers and other relatives, his pupils and teachers.
Three bodies were found abandoned on the NL Kadereita farm
Some hours before detection, the military authorities had shown 11 people in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereita Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finds were found at 1.5 kilometres of Kadereit highway towards Santiago, high in a community known as El Castillo.
A number of people who passed by had noticed that the village house, with its wall painted in the icy and brown, had been opened.
They looked inside, literally three meters, and they discovered the bodies of three people, and they immediately let the authorities know.
One of the men wore a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, with another man in a white shirt next to him.
In almost one foot, there was another person’s body, red shirt, and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, since there was no hyssel.
There are signs in the fence of a village house addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are also several holes in it and in the gates from a bullet.
11 Perils in Kaderette
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in Kadereit municipality and who were accused of abductions, killings, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 6:00 a.m., and military personnel made patrols to the village of Stare Rancho in Kadereit when they saw a car without licence plates with two men in the cabin.
Once they were arrested and inspected, the military found a rifle, a cartridge, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 2:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, after seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Cadereita.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the verge of economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the face of economic disaster and damage to the entire eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present a Cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive branch will take its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of my country to get out of this difficult period,” said the former European Commissioner of Reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he had been able to form a government, but his tone of comment showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The heat is now well-defined," he said.
Monty has completed the process of government formation in less than three days, which is much less common because Italy has dealt with a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level
Under the leadership of the former European Commissioner, Monty must approve the hard economy package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy.
Based on Monty's pressure to rush, unstable markets set up incomes with BTP in Italy 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcha, leader of the Italian employers' Federation, told the reporters after meeting with Monty, “We said we would actively support this government”.
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Sylvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monty’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” said the reporters Angelino Alphaano, secretary of the centrist party.
Support for LDPs, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government's majority, which is composed of the techcrats that make up Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that would probably be non-public reforms of hard economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn Monty’s failure to fail.
Monti started consultations on Monday with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as with young and women's organizations.
He'll finish his dinner on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, the value of Italy's debts had now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial advocates of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would continue until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to undertake reforms before they can start to appoint new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that he should be composed only of technical specialists, showing their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition of parties made it more difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more play experience than Tikos.
Of the 22 players stated in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A minor contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players caused by the two countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the World Cups and Europe, the FFA's monthly number one, have a whole list of A-testing games, Tricollar has only Michael Ouman's advocate as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) at the Romel Fernandez stage.
Spanish footballers playing all the stars in the League and in the powerful Red League clubs in England during this year were very active in leagues and in local cubic competitions, and they are high-level players in the European cups and the League of Cups.
It is worth adding to this the experience of the Spanish Fury in the complex qualifications of Europe or the World Cup.
The players in Tikos, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that the Spanish box is headed by Icker Casillas, who, last Sunday, against England (the engine played 0-1 in London) repeated the record of Andoni Subsarrets' ex-culper, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricollar and will establish a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hernandez, the player of Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casilas and Hawi were found to be the best last week of UEFA, together with another member of the Iberian team, Subsarret, 126 matches and Shalkee Raul Gonzalez bomber with 102.
It's almost close to the hundred Karles Poyol and 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andersa Inezta with 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
On the part of Costa Rica, near Michael Oumana, left side Honior Díaz, with 48 matches and Brian Ruiz bomber, from 45.
Next, only five of the 30 games were won: Cellar Naas, 31, Randall Azophef, 32, Michael Barrantes, 31, Carlos Hernández, 36, and José Luis Lopez, 35
The rest.
More than 30 mats in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Sergio Bousketts (36), Santiago Santa Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31), and Raul Albilo (31).
In a collecting with less than 30 exits, Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks from 26, Gabriel Badilla from 25 and Roy Muri with 23.
The remaining ones did not get to 20 years of age.
While Nacho Morealya has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, Costa Rica has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not debuted.
Spain’s leading player, David William, with 50 heads, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more glasses twice as many as Carlos Hernández and three times as many as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quinte included the country in the prison for the twentieth anniversary of his career
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream that's over.
In an exclusive interview with Via bassist Jeff Anment of Pyll Jam, the group said that it was ready to give one of the best concerts on the next Sunday at the National stadium.
It was more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says that it is also a dream for them that is a reality to play in that country.
This was the statement of the bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Via from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in South America within the framework of a 20-year tour of work and, on Sunday, 20 numbers, will make its only environment in Central America.
On that day, they will stand at the National stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Los Angeles The X team and the Las Roberts local group.
It's a little bit of a conversation that's completely decoded online in The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, is this a lost dream that Parl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still good.
I was in Costa Rica only once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music in.
I'm asking because there's some devotion to the group; fans live on days in front of the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, while waiting for your concert, view it as the largest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we've played over the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've done some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope it brought us to the uniform for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to do surfing and jungles, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her waves for surfing?
We have a lot of silver friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamardo, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends are always doing surfing on Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in Mexico, it's great spots for surfing, that's how we learn about it, from people who love surfing.
When you look at the tour, you could say you made a big show with lots of songs.
What are you planning for the Costa Rica expedition?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any limitations on what we can do.
We're going to make the best show out of the many different songs possible; we're going to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does this work?
I think part of it's because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it's more interesting to people.
That tour is 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock group and that we were doing this for more than 20 years made it look like a dream.
We are happy with our luck and are very encouraged that we can continue to play together.
We all love each other and we love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
We're all very good at it.
What does it mean for you to be a large part of the border's bloom?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with the Soundgarden guys, Mudhoney and Alice in the Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time one group from one city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear in one city at one time.
We're proud and we're honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I'm still playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at the Alley in Chains Festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all, and it's an honor to be part of Sethal's sound.
It's also very strange that a group like you stay together in the same composition for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together 21 years ago, and Matt (Kemeron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We're all very close friends and, as a result, there's also musical roads that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything can't be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance sheet?
As we grew up, the balance became easier to find.
We take care not to be too long in prison because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you've done to be famous and to be a rock star, what none of us seriously care about.
How do you remember your other project, Master Love Building?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't released a single album until Andy's death.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or a photograph, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music, football, and a lot of friends.
It was a wonderful person, and we miss him.
The local Las Roberts group will be responsible for opening the Costa Rica show.
Is it true you know her work, especially Eddie Wedder, so you chose her to open up?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that liked us most, so we don't want to see that Las Roberts can offer a real one, and that should be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at the Yellow Leedbetter concerts?
It's a question for Ed, Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He sings her, and I think he's using the first thing that comes into his mind.
Who affected you as a bassista?
There are so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Átvisle, Si Ja Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Lady Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the border, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a little bit different from the word cross.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those who appear at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that should be heard, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breakhe, which are considered very grim, although they may sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I was listening to them, these songs are very grim.
I think that when you're growing up, and in your life you've had some trauma and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to influence your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make grim music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was hospitalized again for a medical examination
President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital, for a study on muscle loss in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffered from several diseases, including the cancer of a language, which led to his four years of operation and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agina, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimoori would be examined for three days at the National Institute of Unoplasting Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its lower ends.
Agyana said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for pardon on humanitarian grounds; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations for the cancer of a language, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and other diseases were added, such as a strong erosion gastritis, bedrants, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg - bleeding problems, and the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Special Operations Directorate of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for killing 25 people by means of the destruction of the army, which had operated secretly in the early years of his rule.
Mujica is sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Muhika, and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will come this Tuesday, visiting Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujica will meet on the following Wednesday with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important item in the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a timetable issued by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalahara will be “beneficial for the exchange of information on the political relations between the two nations”, as published by the South American leadership on its website.
According to local media reports, Muhika is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident involving France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included South American countries in a sheet of tax harbors at a meeting of G20 in the French town of Kanne.
In his speech Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax harbors, a statement that provoked Uruguay's protest and withdrawal of his Ambassador to the European country for consultations.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 group of the most developed and developing countries since November and has, in fact, a tax exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in recent years to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's “cervious list” from countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay had, since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which had increased trade progress between the two countries.
A successful plumber is going to be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil paws of Bousera, but never before did he do it in three dimensions: Super Mario 3D Land will fight for the love of a girl in stereocopic technology.
A publication that will appear in shops around the world this month has been created according to the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows for playing in three dimensions without having to use eyeglasses.
"Mario is the hero who is supposed to tell you how stereooscopy will work without eyeglasses," said Nintendo, head of the press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is the first Nintendo video game specially designed under this platform, because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Security of Time 3D have adapted existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was a video game that allowed a quick and mobile game to be enjoyed.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contained two games in one: the first part is simple to attract less experienced users.
Once upon a time, most of the experts will go “in the second circle” at levels of play that are now more difficult.
In addition, users may choose in real time between "D Aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions, in order to overcome various obstacles and “do not yield to optical illusions”.
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game of Nintendo, the series is squeezing off fans and repeating a successful formula from previous games, and the oral plumber needs to walk through dangerously mined platforms to release Princess Pich.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "playing".
Circle guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States of America
President Alvaro Colam said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo had begun to respond to a 70 million-million-dollar loan in the United States.
This concludes the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country, which required the issuance of Portillo to judge him there.
At the press conference, Kolam said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the first instance court had already signed extradition.
He argued that during his mandate he had not “put his hands” into legal decisions and had adopted all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Serhio Ruano Marrocín, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edward Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What was done by Colombo showed an executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the State ' s chiefs from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (JC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the loss of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a trial prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and opened the case again.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The outcomes of the first 25 years of social support organization Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people with social exclusion have been helped to overcome the difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary served as a basis for the outcome of the ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Cots factory, to which more than 300 people had come.
Trinijove was born next to Trinita Vela in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of employment and problems with drugs or marginalized ones.
Last night, a large number of responsible organizations and institutions gathered at the San Andreu celebration and worked with the association for 25 years.
The various political representations during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the Generaltate, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-consul of Socialist education, Erneste Maragal, and the Lieutenant Mayor and the current eco-cicist, a member of the municipal council of Ríd Goma.
There was also a current consultant on social welfare and the family, José Lewis Kleris and CEO for the social work of La Caxia, Haum Lanapa, in Fabra I Cots.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far was “a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and of hope for people in difficulties.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work done to her," he said.
An occupied building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The hostages occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmez Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the house of 51 on Balmez Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building that they illegally occupied at noon and organized mass parties that irritated neighbors by court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From this moment on there will be a pass control," said the manager.
The Scooters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the building were occupied with electricity and a portion of the water, painted walls and left traces of different kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a public party site that lasted for two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a night club, Balmez 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantynat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the attackers brought her into unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, a discotheque owner was required to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she noticed that noise was caused, not by visitors to the club, but by its inhabitants, and particularly by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, according to the isolated neighbors.
The owner of the club said that the inconveniences were so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it was nine months before he “forgives ” her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received from neighbours in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the municipal group PP, Adviser Alberto Fernando Diaz, demanded that last week “escape the building immediately in order to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit created by neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the crackers had invaded all the floors and almost every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the selectivity of the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the Nou Barris building.
At 3:30 p.m., police went to Montral Street, 35 days after receiving a telephone call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the opportunity to compete after the pledges have been advanced
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the Collserola role debate in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the wake of the current Barcelona Capital Corporation (UCB), the administration printed literature for Collserol.
It described the mountain as a big park for Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park was reoccupyed by many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital city of Catalonia, one of the few who were oriented not north-south but above (the mountain) to the sea.
Collserol's position as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cab as the Yogi bear.
That was the case until, in September, the Council announced a huge competition made up of 16 contests on many other gates to Collserol.
It's a gate that means the idea of a park, of course.
Either way, or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
Should I ask you one question: Colserola?
The competitions and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are the subject of discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repeated subject discussed when two members of this clan of elected people recognize each other in an elevator.
This fact leads to just one of the few similarities between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scholars who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the sealine, it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the front side of the mountain" when the offer of Ildephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"Let's say Barcelona's largest park is a beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
"Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the headline "Collserol's Gate" contains a "loyal trap": we don't have to think of them as "as the entrance to the park, but as a limitation of certain areas where we must act."
Modola, like Roldan and Bayon, with their experience in urban construction, called the offer of “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “unpredictability of the prediction of public space” following the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the site of the Forum with “his swan song”.
The first fear is the very restriction of boundaries where you can build.
"The restriction of something is the preparation of the next step," that is, the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to a real disaster”.
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than a purely topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is work done outside Calserol, which “does not need to be missed by the mouse”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to join the project “at the outset”.
More than that, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a space that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether the technical profile is what the multidisciplinary teams should lead (“the success”, he argues) were supposed to create, “The architects must be a tool only”.
Bayon suggests that the answer to a question that identifies this part is composed because the rules of the competition lack the general type of Collserol: "The 16 cross-border competitions have been announced - he says - within the meaning of the sea - but there is no lengthy reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to settle for 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for some gates may cross the programme and definition with the draft architect for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the advice is sufficient to ensure that the lane directly above Rhonda deDalt is designed to provide a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Kazino forgives Jonas Larasabal and he will be released
After 72 days, a settled judicial representative, Red Cassino, forgiven his brother Mayor Monterrey in the proceedings against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larasabala will be released after the legal representative, Red Cassino, has granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court, which is in the process of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bomb, Casino Royale, owner Red Cassino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in a gambling house.
Following public conviction, the State Attorney General opened criminal proceedings against the mayor's brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days following the requirements of the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribes and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereit for allegedly half a million pesos to the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with a moderate degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving at San Nicholas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evident evidence of the guilt of Jonas, such as the charging of 1.5 million pesos from bookers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative, Red Cassino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for mercy for the mayor's brother in the region, so that he could be free in the following hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if he had compensated for the damage and who of the partners in the games house would grant pardon, even though the lawyer tried not to speak the name.
Based on entries 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larasabal, and it was not possible to make any statements thereafter regarding the process that had been planned against him; neither would any reparation or punishment be required.
Following a hearing by the legal representative of the bookiemen, at nearly 3:50 p.m., it was ordered to release Larrábal Breton immediately.
The court official, Jorge Janez, went to the prison of San Nicolas municipality in Garz to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Pérez Hacomé tells of the specific catastrophe in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, was killed, and seven others were killed.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (ITC) reported that the results of the accident, during which Francisco Blake More, Minister of the Interior and seven others died, showed that the helicopter struck directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity, without a pilot's attempt to take an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionicio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft got up, the pilot found that weather conditions were good for flight.
"The Ellies, which seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the land, the wings were in contact with trees by 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its plumage."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the required transport requirements.
He also said that the studies carried out in the impact area did not indicate that parts were available on land.
“The study reports that there are no components of the vessel in another location, the impact has occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“Vertolet was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfied the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of between 7 and 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said that the main point was to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was guided by the cruise speed and that it was on a soft, rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis about normal flight manoeuvres at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hacomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports revealed suitable conditions for take-off when an aircraft travelled to the border area between the town of Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where clouds were seen at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team was looking for a lower altitude and a greater visibility in the Cuernavaca valley.
Place of strike.
The impact coordinates and the last record from the radar of the aircraft are likely to coincide with the loss of control or change of flight prior to the impact.
Vacuum discharges in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter has encountered land under structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the area of disaster, there remains unsearchable evidence in the wreckage of the vessel, some sort of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there could be multiple contacts with land.
During the operation, pieces of air were found at a height of 9.200 feet [9200 m] above sea level and the ground has a slope of from 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed on the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several clashes with the land.
After a thorough study in larger territory, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found near the site where the disaster occurred, thus strengthening the assumption that the impact had occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces a search engine for an obesity gene
Social protection is headed by a study on the search for a child and young person's obesity gene; it is supported by professionals from IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSI) has announced that a study is being carried out to detect the gene of obesity among children and young people, which has been called the “Genics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents” protocol, which will provide an assessment of the signs of overweight weight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, immunists and social workers had been gathered.
The team is assisted by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CONVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
Whether or not the population is invited to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study, a test with the participation of children will be conducted from 8:00 a.m. to Mexico City, where every Saturday.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at a sports centre in Cuauthemaké (West of Mexico State) and that since 8 October, activities had been held at a sports centre in Nesahuaalkotole, east of the state of Mexico.
After reaching the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children, the study will continue at the Independent Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre in Mexico City.
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the component and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Day against diabetes will be observed, and the main objective is to gather three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 to allow parents to be allowed and examined to fill individual nutrition surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that result in diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that an anthropometric measurements would be carried out on Saturday for all participants (weight, growth and volume), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in six years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent suffered from obesity, in the case of girls, 47 per cent; in the case of overweight girls, there has also been a significant increase in weight,” said expert MSSI.
He said that the justification for finding markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexico was 65 per cent a descendant of American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of Europeans and five per cent of the descendants of Africans, which had an impact on genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that mainly the effect of obesity genetics was the inability of the body to burn out the energy we consume (aloria) and it is postponed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants was a comprehensive assessment of children who could determine whether they had any weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on his neck (acatants) and forebodings means that it is likely that there is a breach of mybolism or even a predebate.
Information is made available in all confidentiality, and doctors transmit it to parents in writing, to whom they explain all measurements and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid illness.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for causing excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of television, and using light distance transport instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (metals, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and the genetic bias analysed in the programme.
UNAM will be able to avoid cracking
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Department, developed a polymer-moded bat to make a mixture of the best quality, sustainable to the environment and temperature.
If attention had been paid to traffic signals, it would have been necessary to repair some 200,000 eggs for each rainy season in the Mexico City district, Raphael Herrera Nahera, a researcher in the UNAM chemical department, and added that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt road surface was normal, the number of eggs could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
The International Year of Chemistry, in his lecture, reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-moded bitumen to produce a mixture of close to the bat but with the best resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve road quality and consequently to counteract the education of the pits.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one is a high molecular mass called asphalts, and the other is a low molecular mass called Maltens, which together give roadside cover to its characteristic visceral behaviour.
The relative behavior of a bitumen is that at high tempmerates, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid at 120 of its viscosity, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that resistance to street asphalt is not constant but changes throughout the day, depending on the environment and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The chemophaca scientist observed that the streets of Mexico are mostly covered with flexible coatings made up of six layers of material, of which the three include bitumen.
Among the highest layers is a batum made up of small stones thrown down and then suppressed.
Every stone that is covered with this, he said, is buried in a bat.
When vehicles move and exert efforts, this helps the forces to make very good distribution of the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt floor, he added, the last layer, called the layer of wear, which is made of small rock, actually the sand is also wrapped in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphalt covering and road friction.
As part of the road surface that would receive and disseminate these efforts, the weariness also requires proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperatures, are also important factors for consideration, especially of water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of asphalt.
When the land is syringe, the water penetrates and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all the layers of the surface to be blurred and hence the creation of pits.
In the light of the pits, he said, the first thing to do was to wear off and only then affect the bitumen, but the damage didn't happen instantly, and that's the process that should be taken into account at the first feature of the current maintenance programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport is another important factor in the development of the hole, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the surface must always be related to the transport load and the requirement must be guaranteed in order to prevent the frequent appearance of the pit.
Rafael Herrera said that much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to produce eggs with ease and heat.
Why didn't you hold a candidate from Valle to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons Serne Melina Ramírez was prevented from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Kauca is left to wish for the crown of Miss Colombia.
On this occasion, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be pleased with the podium of the winners with the silver crown and lintel proclaiming her new princess Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Mission won the crown and the Scytheter, the Department has 14 titled Princess, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Caucas, who were close to the crown but were declared by the Princess, including Mirías Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patrica Belina Aalie (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arennas (1987), Laila Blanco (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsael Pinedo (1990), Diane Ichael Romero (1993), Hisse Alhure Garcez (2000), Katalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephana Haraldo (2008).
The question that many are currently asking is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main phrase, which in each speech demonstrated that it has everything to become a new mission to Colombia, it's not just that it was elected by the Queen of Police and the most beautiful person on Vogue, the titles given to the Queen, such as Tatian Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor to play a role in the jury ' s decision to award her the title First Princess was that she was unable to answer correctly the question, "What book characterizes you, and why?" given by Martin Murilla Gómez of the literary community, let's count.
She responded to the person asking:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that a book that characterizes my childhood is the Little Prince, a pretty deep book.
Today, I am reading "Crimination and Punishment" -- this is a work of world literature that all of us should read; I also read the book of Irina of German, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Lar of Blood."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “culturalization” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted characterized it.
But after the Melina ceremony, she said that she was calm and pleased with her result: "The inhabited wise, the things are going to happen."
And all of you please read for a while, Little Prince is a great book.
Among the hypnotisms, Vale burned out of favouritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that, because she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster's robin competition, the audience vote for the best national suit, and the Queen-Mati), “that gave rise to the jealousy of other candidates, caused stress to the queen, and, as a result, she was not gliding on stage”.
And that was observed during her first appearance in the swimr on Hilton beach and during her two displays of the evening coronation.
Although both seemed confident, it was evident that it lacked the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become a queen.
In addition, the Vale representative has recently avoided communication with the press and this has been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that a representative of Vale failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Red Cross.
That is why two days before choosing a member of Lucy Doti's international jury, they said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we must look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public mind before they enter the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the Vale’s representative was a defect on the berries and fibrosis that was placed on her belly, but that was controversial, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Adviser to Queen Jorge Hernán Orrosco notes that Melina had no best body, which was better, “but the problems of fibrosis in her belly that I didn't see so much, made her lose her glasses the last day”.
Among other things, journalist Gvido Oios of Cromos believes that the error of a representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subject to surgical intervention.
"The operations are good, but the Vale's representation doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never an advantage, and here she was punished.
With regard to the prize that first was served by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the brutal prediction took place last night, saying that it was a uncle whom Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for not having enjoyed the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact that Melina begins today as a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia in an international competition referred directly to by the organizers of the National Convention.
However, she will go back to history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining crowns.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminalist from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
On 4 November, criminalist CTI Kali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Head FARC Alfonso Cano in comparison with his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensics working in CTI, Elisear González, a Puerto Tehad man who had spent 21 years in judicial investigation, came in line this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in Choko, where he often had to walk over five days through the jungle to reach a place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle, and after completing the courses, he became a forensic specialist in criminist matters, where he studied the friction of the skin, that is, the palms and the body.
During the week of Elysar's human identification operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Kauca in Palmira.
He knew that he would need to identify two corpses, one of whom was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him on the outside; he was very different from what the media showed.
He was without beards, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses, and much worse.
But the prints aren't lying.
Using an expanded glass, ink, shovel, and torch, Elizar compared fingerprints of the body to those on the pictures.
His eyes didn't fail, it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the leader of the FARC.
Searching for fingerprints
The recognition of President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for a docs expert in the Dociloscopi area of Sijin from Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopicus is a strict science, without mistakes, that can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, Dracolysopia specialists are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder, and identify detainees.
When arrested, many criminals have false documents or no documents.
We take their prints and look for them at the base.
The researcher said that if he was stolen, he had to carry out a piece of the house because the thief was back there with his hands to wear a safe full of jewelry and money.
"It's hard to work with the walls because they're not a convenient surface for taking off prints, but in that case we can take a picture of the whole system and identify the criminal who's been involved in several thefts," he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man with bottles from under his elbow around him was found.
During the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of having committed a crime and, in fact, fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
The Dactiloscopics specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or a physical reagent is present at the site where the print is available.
When they appear, a spade or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is the database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have many undocumented Colombians," said expert CTI.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all you touch leaves prints on you.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Unfavoured people are challenging the New York authorities
Hundreds of protestors broke the camp in front of the Zukcottt area.
Some protestors heard the court ' s decision to break the demonstration from the area and went to the park in the neighborhood.
Members of the Wall Street movement dropped a challenge on Tuesday to the New York authorities when they tried to enter again, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Grand Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters dug into the area of Zukotati, where they wanted to get through a judicial order that allowed the “discovered people” to break up camp in the area while the other part of the movement responded to the break-up, taking over the park in the north of the city where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that since the court does not allow us to break up the camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bree, a representative of the Wall Street movement.
Brey explained that the response of the “disgusted people” to the tent town ordered personally by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had come to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting violent evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “disgusted people” began to take over a new park located at the site of a merger of the Central Street of Canal Street Stret and Sixth Avenue, near the entry into Holland, which is connecting New York and New Jersey, and the member Church of Trinity.
At least for a time they could take up this place, but then the police came and started arresting some of the protestors, although Bree could not call the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The Organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents at a place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support for the members of the movement by attempting to act as mediator in the negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zukotti area, which is private ownership, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today ' s morning breakup of protestors.
Some of the protesters who went there were and distributed at the same time copies of that court order, and even provided these copies to police officers who had protected the area, leading to “some minor clashes”, said Bree, who said that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The Judicial Order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and forcing them to carry out “laws issued after the capture has begun, or prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with the shops and other property used earlier”.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that the city had suspended the opening of the public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws did not allow them to turn around tents and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from the Zukotti area at dawn, an operation during which some 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protestors “were in violation of the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had given an order to clear the area, because it became “the place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” because “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation that took place this morning was repulsive and shows that in the depths of Bloomberg there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of a movement that condemns the mayor for “not respecting freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for "Inclusive Wall Street" also indicated that they intended to organize “grave actions” on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bblede and other distinguished Canadians, it will appear on the TV program Russell Peters' Christmas on 1 December.
Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Big Repair", a savior in "Malbe's Witnesses," Banny in Pleboe, the wife of Tommi Lee, and now the actress and model would be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the Cruderer (Dillerer), Michael Bubble and other distinguished Canadians, will appear on the TV program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" of December 1st, as a very special Mary.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known on a widely distributed home-based pornographic video, where she is together with her husband, a drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary, holding the weeds of Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comet of Indian origin, recently served as the leader of Charlie Shin's "My Cruel Toprpid of Truth."
In addition to Anderson and Peters, in a special Christmas show, CTV participates in a Canadian singer in Bblem, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March on the Argentine model of Louisiana Lopilotto, and who also knows the pitch in scandals.
Bublee recently called the American american Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan, which was reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the rate of fall that started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and continues to recover from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe that has been carried over by the Falling Sun since World War II.
According to the Tokyo Government's first estimate, material losses amounted to $30,000 million, a blow that seems to be taking place despite the difficult world situation.
After three consecutive quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 and also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery may partly be attributed to the revival of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against the 0.9 per cent reduction in capital costs, which was observed between January and March, the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true turning point in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenesian momentum, which calls for a crisis to be used to strengthen - or to rebuild - infrastructure by using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly through the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This figure increased by 1 per cent under increased vehicle, travel and rest costs.
Clicking on the Arena
Tokyo has given the domestic market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the shelter towers chosen by investors who want to escape the euro-zone debt crisis and negative projections of the United States, a privilege that will impose a stone on exporting companies' accounts.
In a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, is recognized as ein in their low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to be swept by the EU’s offshore countries, the Government of Eschiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be alert to persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the dramatic increase in yen values, said last night the Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furudava.
And actually, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated a clear decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the upheavals in the world economy has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points after it has hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Gives the Grounds of Reservation
Paradomos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written undertaking
With the limits on risk and uncertainty prevailing in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze, which is leading to the withdrawal of the large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “concession” of the new Transitional Government of Elders is imposed more on Brussels than on the true belief of political forces is beginning to confirm the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Paradomos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the conservative leader of the “New Democracy” party, Antonis Samaráz, stated that he would not support new measures of strict economy in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The primary objective of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, saying that Papadomos was yesterday, opening up parliamentary debates, which will culminate tomorrow in the essence of the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samas' message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we have nothing to promise”.
The Conservative Leader has taken one step further in his attitude regarding the EU and IMF, the organizations that are required to unfrozen the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effects of the papandre referendum's allegations of style or style, repeated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume assistance unless the new Government and leaders of the Greek main parties sign “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeo Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new Government, “that must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
There are plenty of threads in the Greek tuber for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed Spain's “core” place with regard to this type of finance
Spain has “reserved a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor for cooperation instruments, whose “reality”, she said, is that it is “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on belief in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit yesterday in Valladolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt that such actions are “fully necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals of the United Nations by 2015 and that “especially with a view to reducing by half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty is reflected”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world, taking on this task with full “responsibility”, says Mrs. Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, “will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, the “core recipients of these loans”.
There are “a number of achievements” and “many difficulties we face”.
The Microcredit Summit is not only a place for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two fundamental objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of those households would be removed from the poverty to which they were caught.
Impulse to establish a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "was on the path initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Mrs. Sofia as "an act of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as “a striking idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years, since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy on the ground.
The first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continued development,” said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project brought her yesterday to the title of “family leaders” of the Valladolid “poor Bank”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling for participation in the debate and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity was “the ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with economic booms, since it was a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit meant a “serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty” and that now, “more than ever” Governments of developed countries should work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of a reduction in costs.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the “successs” in giving “liquidence” to the people “divided before whom all the doors were closed” and Mayor Valyadolid Francisco driveer Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who were“ opening their doors to a spirit of solidarity”.
HTS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HLC) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig was without major problems for Chancellor Angel Merkel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme, but it had itself emerged in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who felt that the Government ' s policy was not as strict as it should be today as Greece and perhaps tomorrow as Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which was discussed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
For several minutes, the estrangements continued, which earned the statements of Angel Merkel and several hours later Wolfgang Schouble, Europhile and the Minister of Finance, and left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
"It's time for the Chancellor to break through Europe."
This could mean a change in the Lisbon Treaty, which could strengthen the European Union's control over the European Union's financial policies, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to make Europe a person”.
At any rate, it is one of the proposals of a draft resolution adopted by Congress, whose idea apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schouble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain opposes this, and HLC leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against this too.
But the soil has been prepared.
Similarly, delegates to the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each member of the European Union in the European Central Bank, according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
While she wanted to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor had increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kola, but she did not seek to influence Congress by means of “little” European countries or countries in difficult situations who liked to criticize Germany’s “highly high”.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a full paragraph to the importance of German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Only by passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating injuries of the Polish army.
What is a hospital fraud?
Following monetary benefits, UMP and the Government began to attack hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and give a talk on the subject, which has been raised periodically since 2007 on combating social security fraud.
And in order to help this attack, which is caused by the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing campaign to re-election to the President, most want to concentrate on hospital letters.
Above all, with budget savings, the Government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the commencement of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer ' s particular consent, the employer will lose four days ' wages, equivalent to a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to produce a storm of anger but which, according to Les Yechos, will result in savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by more symbolic measures, namely to impose one day on public servants without sickness benefits (the civil servants have not yet been required to wait for the benefit, unlike the three-day expectations of private sector employees).
At a time when these issues are under discussion, most also raise the topic of fraud again, with a view to abuse in the issuance of hospital leaves.
The control will become stronger and easier if you're caught, you'll have to pay back all of your illegal payments," warned Xavier Bertrann on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the real abuse of hospital letters.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant control and political attacks that have produced their fruits.
There's no more pain in France than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to €11.3 million, representing 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of that amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and industrial accidents, and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, representing 6.2 million euros.
Thus, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 on hospital, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic average, which masks some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said that they had not taken a hospital day.
Another study, for this time on health insurance, asserts that in 2010, 37 per cent of hospital staff lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months, and 11 per cent were longer.
By comparing these figures with those of the European neighbours, it is clear that French employees are no longer inclined to take the form of ill-treatment.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence of employment in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital fraud is very low compared with “separate” employment.
At the level of fraud, it's very low.
Intensification of the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic screening of hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases verified, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term health certificates were “unjust” or too long”, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of regularly checked hospital leaves over 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “unappropriate or unfounded”, or 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases are reported to have been “unfounded” by several million hospital workers.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the numbers of the "separate" employment.
According to UMP, Dominika Tiana, the author of the report in June, is between 9 and 15,000 million euros of unreserved budgetary income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is thus infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Paradomos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November in Parliament, by Prime Minister Lucas Pandumios, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to carry out that task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, stated the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the axis of trust in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October must be a “core task” of the new Government, as the country's presence in Eurozone was added.
Consequently, Paposios predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit of “approximately 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right to deny the new Government
On Monday, Anthony Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to overcome the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the challenges of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that prevented economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance, reports the Committee of Experts.
Canadians are denied death, claimed in a report from the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that this is not the case with cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code so as to permit external suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is 10th in place, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada gave birth to a culture in which people fear to argue on the subject of death”.
No medicalization, but 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The country's highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance, the authors conclude that it is contrary to the Federal Government ' s position that they have already stated that they do not wish to change anything in the criminal code in respect of euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts, who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization is an abuse of use, i.e., euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance for people who cannot or do not want to take such a decision.
On the contrary, at a teleconference, Jocelyn Downi, who presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Foreign suicide is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid, in 2010, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who had assisted with suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for end-of-life health care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls upon the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminalization already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it is not used to suppress physical pain as euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “the beauty” because, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to death.
This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old can ask for assistance in suicide, says Mr. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that " there are signs and prohibitions in society."
Margaret Somerville, a health specialist, also expresses “categorical opposition to the findings of the report, which she called “a manifesto of euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, inter alia, the report on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to take power
Damascus condemns “a conspiracy”
Syria Gets More Isolation
Bashar Assad ' s supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country, increased.
Two days after the suspension of the Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened sanctions against Damascus, while the neighbours of Syria and Jordan had resigned President Assad.
Jordan's King Abdall II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime were killed.
“If Bashar were to be driven by his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Turkey ' s Foreign Minister, Ahmet Duvetogle, regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and who cannot satisfy their aspirations lose power, he said, as he directed at Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is increasingly strict.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “extension of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking a increasingly rigid course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces have been killed in the Dar`a district of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and the shooting of heavy machine guns at Jobar in the fall town of Homs, according to this NAG.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mualm stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was a “hazardous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he adds, confident that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to remove Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands the repudiation of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Zuppe also advocated the departure of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from repression of the regime that, he said, fell into paranoia.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan for the 2 November crisis, including the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, called the “unadjustable” decision of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to overcome the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time from markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a programme that would require “sacrifices” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today ' s meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate Cabinet made up of non-Competiators.
Monty spoke of the importance of the victim programme, said Francesco Nucar, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups who had been involved in discussions after meeting with the Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Jaffranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote until Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the submission of a limited list from a dozen or around that Head of Country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervous stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
In the “democracy, time is needed for the preparation of government and programme”, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but his concern arose once again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, the technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
The new Government would have to act until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to Speaker Jaffranco Fini of the Chamber of Deputies, the new Government will have the trust of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, as he entered the post, he would work harder to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that “Despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the target budget for 2013, despite the strict economy plan of recent months, demanded, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian boss, Emma Marchhalya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), introduced “a shift in the age” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “a professor” symbolizing the “receives of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to tradition authors.
The great unknown is his team's permanence.
The President of Nicaragua would be pleased to avoid the early elections, since by April 2012, Italy was expected to pay $200,000 million in public debt.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scholar Vjaceslav Danilenko assisted Iran in developing a nuclear-weapon-usable detonator confirmed on Monday, an American agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency in order to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “may-be military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “since the sixtieth anniversary, at the Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and involved the production of synthetic diamonds in explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to establish a company producing nanomagazine in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his companies led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, until its return to Russia
The IAEA's report refers to “indicatives that Iran's development” of the nuclear detonators system “made the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well, but who also told the Agency that he was working most of his career on this technology as part of his own country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the Fbi statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence fell slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, stresses Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims,” adds the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as serious violations of human rights," added one of the leaders of the Polish organization Lejandra.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, it adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
The federal law 's hate crimes are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microsite changed the presentation of its platform to allow its users to, inter alia, see the activity of those they track, what makes this service look like on Facebook.
The new “business” tab and the other “name” enable you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, Internet users, whose messages ("tate") you monitor, and those who follow you.
This makes it possible to find out if they publish messages if they subscribe to new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “at a small percentage of users in August” before making extensive use of the entire network on Monday, AFP announced a Twitter press report to Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively unintelligible and as using rather vague terms (RTs to stop someone else's communication, #followfuary for guidance to track other users), is basically a pleasure to experienced users, and thus opens up to a wider audience, representing users something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On-line users discussed this innovation with Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, it's too hard and too hard to remember Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, written by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the Golden Budget
The leadership of a large coalition of socialdemocracys and Christian democracies in Austria decided, on Tuesday, to write down a budget “solet rule” in the Constitution in order to reduce the fiscal deficit and thus avoid possible lowering of Austria's public credit rating agencies (troika A).
The Chancellor of Social Democratic, Werner Faimann, personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, considerably higher than the 60 per cent ceiling of the Maastricht Treaty, but below the national debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria had lost its capacity to pay only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million euros more than every year, raised the argument of the Vice-Canker and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian democracies Michael Schpindelegger.
Austria thus implements the summit of the Eurozone on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State or Government demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced State accounts through the Constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's regulation reminds us of the German model since Germany was the first European country to take that “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent per year of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal State in any year should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP, while land, like communities, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to make the public debt fall below the 60 per cent target of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eschiko Noda
Threats to new currency market intervention
Japan's Prime Minister, Eshiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new foreign exchange intervention if the value of the yen continued to grow.
We intervene as the last time we thought the exchange rate was excessive, explained by Mr. Nod Senath.
On Tuesday, yen grew to almost historical marks that led the Japanese authorities to an intervention on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold a large-scale yen to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of power since 1945.
But since then, yen has been growing up continuously, uprooted by investors who view it as a “protection” in these sad times of falling economies around the world and of the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic table at 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms abroad when converted into national currencies.
Japan fights to rebuild itself after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (North-East), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile cause of reconstruction.
The third largest economic power in the world has resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent, compared with the previous quarter - the first year of the year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of families affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic performance”.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Aduzumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its monetary policy council two days on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Managing Agency, Hirohid Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “conforming steps” to understand that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) to purchase treasury bonds, raising up to 55,000 million yen (59,000 million euros) in ceilings that it has allocated to purchase various financial instruments to feed the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates grow, stock exchanges merge
The risk of debt crisis contamination undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozones, European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little farther into the deny zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished trading at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Due to new difficulties in paying loans to hard-to-use eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"The affected investors are just too worried about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the IG Markets institutional broker quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed by 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market participants ' doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked forward to looking at Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a narrow corridor until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsige Akino, Fund Manager in Ichioschi Investment Management.
This recovery of concern about the future eurozone is taking place in a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
Euro has reached its lower mark in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570 and fell by 0.4 per cent.
According to brokers, she fell after the party of Chancellor Angel Merkel HDS on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, for a country in difficult circumstances to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially higher than 6 per cent
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain high.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent and Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent.
These interest-rate difficulties in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Padamos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be a “core task” of his Government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Infinitely, the interest rate for Germany and Spain ' s 10-year debt has reached a new historical maximum.
Looking forward to the growth rates in Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent as a result of increased consumption of households.
Insee, however, revised downwards in the figure of the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stabilizing.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded a growth of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first estimate for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which energy policies cannot be decided after brief discussions or emotions have taken place, this is the case.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a pretext for thinking about the fate and place of nuclear energy.
The balance will not bear fruit unless all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed are examined.
France must base its views on objective facts and rational data.
Now we have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will have doubled the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing scarcity of resources in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, without forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat the climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The accident on Fukumite doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
It is not a case of Belgium, which is dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil is but a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukusimo, to add one unit to its set, to resume the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the Tri-Miil Island accident.
Although the model of Germany, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the validity is contrary to this argument.
Berlin ' s selection will result from an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, to jumps in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all of these adverse effects will already be felt.
An example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbine champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the same thing as the largest coal and gas consumer due to overheating wind; thus, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than Europe ' s average.
On the other hand, due to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than for French households.
Because in a globalized economy, energy prices are key factors in competitiveness and in the provision of services to industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the most cheap electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any meaningful reduction in nuclear power would result in a greater increase in the value of electricity, which would make striking statements of the new industrialization of our country and of the protection of purchasing power.
The price most French refuse to pay is especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy had made it possible to establish an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 mediated.
Strongly export-oriented, it engages a whole range of specialized enterprises in international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electronic engineer would order an EPR to work for sixty years if its manufacturer was to be shut down?
In order to resolve the equation of energy, we must recognize that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of low carbon dioxide, nuclear and renewable solutions by Arva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is a vital issue
In France, we have a security body, which carries out the uncommitted and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is widely recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Miil Island, took place under normal conditions of operation, but without any human or environmental consequences
In Chernobyl, the reactor’s device and the inaccuracies of human error led to tragedy.
In Fukumé, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented force that claimed tens of thousands of lives.
The nuclear industry learns from this accident, as it learned from the two previous ones.
The area of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German engineers, EPR, is presented a project that addresses such phenomena.
Because it is seen by all energy professionals who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flammanville will be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to take up leadership in the inevitable development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of sources of energy for our country, but it would irresponsibly allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - burden or economic benefit?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy was criticized on various sides - overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate figures policies, and compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as “a State of human rights”.
Then there was an administrative harassment of foreign students who got on the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberasion of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, pebbles and waitressses”.
But it is rarely considered economically.
The right and left-hand agree to a great deal.
On the right side was Jacquek Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not become a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers”, and on the left side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can not accept the poor from all over the world”.
Differences only at the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of entry into the country ' s territory was felt by a Polish plumber both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will be able to show towards immigrants.
François Olland, in his programme, had limited his ability to do so, saying that “joint work would solve our immigration problem”.
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem could be an electoral advantage, but it was economically costly.
As economists Ian Golden and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarized recent data on immigration: How migration has shaped our world and determined our future, May 2011, Princeton University publication, 352 seconds, there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
The restriction of immigration has led to a decline in growth and a decrease in employment.
The fear of immigrant influence is based on the perception that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by driving down wages.
However, experience has shown that immigrants are much more complementary in reality than local labour, carrying out jobs for which local labour is scarce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A Positive Impact on Wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the intercomparison between local and immigrant communities has led to the positive effect that immigrants ' arrivals have on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1 per cent increase in migration flows results in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This without regard to the fact that the diversity of immigrants has contributed to new ideas and economic growth (by the American Nobel laureates, a large share of naturalized immigrants, and by Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, all were based on immigrants).
Migrants also make net gains in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of the overall budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who has arrived at the age of 30 would, in his life, bring a net return to the State budget (income minus expenditure) on average Euro150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to get caught up in the missing points of growth.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to scare immigrants, had an equally opposite effect.
Europe's vision of democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent should remember that when it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it survived the tragedy of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Guayata, as well as Franco in Spain, the Slazara in Portugal and the colonel in Greece.
Some believed that democracy should be completely successful over its enemies, that it would be sufficient to have a vote and that it would be as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, Milgoo knows that this is happening from the surface of the mind.
A general vote, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be a “depression tool”, as a repudiian philosopher Etienne Vasro once said.
No, democracy demands much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a democratic crisis.
In this regard, the plinodia of the true-lived Greek referendum will have a double-sensitivity effect, showing both the need for a serious change in policy and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and consistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referenda, organized as much as possible and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch, or a leap with his feet tied to the spread of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of the guillotine blade, but of the implementation of a joint, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis -- Europe's crisis.
All Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, to its weakness and to lack of solidarity.
Europe as a whole is reduced on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project should be returned urgently to national sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the debt burden of everyone, free from markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
An exit from the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without bringing us into disaster.
After a long debate on this proposal of socialists and Jacque Delore, the European economic government is still demanding.
Let him do it.
But to represent her without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into effect is another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, we had to create Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
That lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
The off-the-board records are spreading more and more.
The World Show of Maps is launched on Tuesday, Tuesday, in Vilnius, under Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, the year 2011 will conclude 11 per cent of world sales of microprocessors (bank maps, SIM telephones), exceeding 6,000 units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector is the non-continuous sector, which allows for the payment of public transportation or purchases by simply holding a map over the reading device.
This year, the world will sell 460 million uncontaminated chip cards, compared with 320 million earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (a total of 580 million units are expected) and almost 10 per cent of the world's chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which had long been left behind the Asia-Pacific region, was now moving forward in the area of non-contractory payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been maintained and 75,000 terminals are accepted.
France starts with a more modest position: there are 40,000 in-kind Visa cards.
But big stores are increasing speed.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million endless Pass MasterCard.
To move at a higher speed, banks need to provide equipment for their customers.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to distribute in the future banking cards to their clients, designed for non-contractual use,” said Gérard Nebuy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of developing the future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few machines have been equipped with NFC (Driver Field Information) technology to perform such transactions.
"They have been postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
“We look forward to world sales of 80 million to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Creedit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
An iPhone equipment of about 200 clients and staff will be provided with non-competition Czechs.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to start a market proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boco Haram sect.
The long-held links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now confident of this.
“The aid that these two organizations use and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without getting into the details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January revealed two tiers.
The people who had been abducted at a restaurant in Niamey, close to Aqm, Antoine de Leocure and Wensan Derey were apparently killed the following day together with several of the hijackers during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the wreckage left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone cards belonging to terrorists.
This is terror.
An analysis of the calls was provided by several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who lived long enough in Maidiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram Collib, and the other is said to be close to Aqm and towards a sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boco Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It is also known for many years that the sect receives financial and innovative support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of mortals and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, now exerts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of uninterested people.
A Rapid Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and at the imme-fundamentalist Mohammed Jusuf, Boko Haram -- which means “Western education is sin” -- preaches the establishment of Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It has been politicized and requires strict adherence to the Shariah, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, pro-boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction is as usual uncommitted.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect is now radicalized and beyond its northern pillars.
Last Christmas, she took on responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Josa, and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack against a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the Organization of the United Nations will be their first international objective.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is a matter of concern to all security experts today.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger, Somalis from Al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during the interview with Presidents Goodlauk Jonathan Alain Juppe, he warned of the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace, as seen by Republican candidates for presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Is it possible for America, weakened by the crisis, to pursue a complex world with simple and, more precisely, simplified ideas?
If you heard the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could have believed it.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have multiplied the loud but lacking details of foreign policy statements, which are traditionally a strong part of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and Israel often mix with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being nominated by the Good Party Star, threatened to lodge a complaint against the Chinese in WTO and to accuse them of “the manipulation of their currency is a sensitive topic for America, the silhouetted migration of entire industries into Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate in a complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that followed emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's foreign position).
But Huntsman, who's kept at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
In Reagan's style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran, he will call."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing to honour his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneurs Herman Kane, the second candidate rating, showed a disheartening lack of awareness of the case.
He had recently called for resistance to Chinese military threat, because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power — evidently not knowing that China already possessed it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supported Israel and sought military strikes against Iran, said that he was prepared to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kan, Perry and Michel Bahman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCeine, the heavy external policy.
The opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of the “man” from Iraq, his catch in Libya, which brought him a reputation for a weak policy.
But the attack is not so simple.
The population considers it a positive balance of national security at Obama, which has eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention, which is tied in sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be restructured economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new gates for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The North Strait pipeline linking Western Europe and Russia directly across the Baltic Sea was launched.
It is designed to provide a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State or Government, took part in the last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra and the sparks, the opening of the North Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fión, and his Dutch colleague Martha Rite together returned a symbolic valve that controlled the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 275,000 million additional cubic metres of gas will come to Western Europe each year through the first 1224 km pipeline linking the Leningrad region with the land of Mexlenburg-Pomernia.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous project is a victory.
The project met with strong opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of Warsaw's debate, there was no delay in comparing North Potacle with the new “Germno Sowet Pact”, referring to the Hitler-Stalin alliance with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
That means the question is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supply.
But at the cost of the power deprivation of Europe, because the project created a gate between eastern and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of a direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas and whose own reserves are already at their disposal.
"This law pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that binds us organicly," said François Fiion, opening the pipeline, showing how important and politically and economically big gas contracts are.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the heads of Gazprom present in large quantities in Ljubmina, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is made of steel in concrete to protect it from anchorships.
It's on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to cross the minefields left since the Second World War.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jans Muller, secretary of the North Pot.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, with no breaks all over its length, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform had been planned in the Swedish region, but project managers had abandoned it because Sweden was not happy that a Russian government company would live off its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will go into the air.
But that seems unlikely to be the designers who designed seams that were only about 100,000 years old.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that pulls the ship, for external observation, and by a gas detector.
A cigarette apparatus shall be opened inside a pipe 1 meter in diameter and driven forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on any form of metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The gas circulates only by pressure.
It consists of 200 bars when passing and 100 bars when arriving.
Five companies have combined their efforts to carry out the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent) each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent).
The five companies have established a joint venture called the North Stream, which has been assigned to build and operate gas pipelines.
His headquarters is located in Tsug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years, with the possibility of extending the volume of gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the full amount, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported," claims Jens Muller.
Finance for gas pipeline construction was secured by 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro 7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investments will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay off their expenses because Gazprom takes on all the risks.
The gas pipeline withdraws from the Baltic Sea to Ljubmina on a sandy shore, squeezed by heavy trees.
The vents are 4 feet [4.5 m] high and form the reference gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
In full power, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Molesken Brand Block
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
He's got the aroma of adventures, the hours spent behind the letter in the light of the candle.
Moleskin' tape is easy to find out on a flat black cover, on a rubber, across yellow and white pages, as if yellower over time.
However, a recorded book by Molesken, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to start design blocks for sale.
Maria Sebregundi, the company’s host consultant at the time, took on responsibility for launching the new product.
The note is inspired by an old production technique, a mite - covered cotton cloth, used for example to cover benches.
Writers and travellers are said to value this type of notebook.
"Moleskine brought in with today's taste an old and forgotten thing, which was a cult for the vangarde artists until the twentieth century," told Maria Sebregandi, who has since become the manager of the Modo Modo brand.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales grew by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We left far from the first few years of production, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to set up a typical buyer's profile, because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a free profession.
Malesken’s customers are cosmopolitan, broad-based and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now had 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks at Fnac bookshops, stores in small towns, and has become widely known.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need for writing, despite the emergence of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebrigandi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently set up an exhibition called "The Great Way" where architects and artists have shown their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the Leopard drawings on the occasion of the Lokarno film festival.
With its success and cultural aura, Molessine has varied its products, which now include bags, pens, computers bags, and brands of all kinds of support.
The success of envy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Sintégra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average rate of unemployment, namely 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the general population.
Are you kidding me?
“No,” stresses Eric Blancche, Director General Adapt, organization that organizes a week's employment for persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 times 3 times greater."
"There's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are many more barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have a low level of qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, representing 85 per cent of the average for persons with disabilities compared with 38 per cent.
In short, all these are criteria which make it very difficult to return to work and which constitute the essence of the problem, according to Christian Grapen, Director-General Tramplin, of the Association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entrepreendre, commissioned by Cité, revealed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “providing to be full of people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers in the law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We're about 3% today," says Pierre Blan, Director-General of Agefich, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that fail to comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “contributed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and between 606 and 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which raised the tax, created strong pressure on the company, explains Pierre Blan.
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, in particular in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 workers.
Azar: "Some happiness."
Before fighting the Blue on Tuesday evening (20.45 a.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We're not going to go along to argue that they had a secret conspiracy, but the painting is symbolic.
Seats near the rostrum of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar died.
Five months after leaving his fight against Turkey, a Belgian trainer can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Edna, his progress and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further, I believe Lille's player.
As to the contrast between his achievements at the club and the assembly, that's one whole, he's justified.
"In Lille, I'm in the middle of a year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to make glasses."
On a reserve with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar arrived in St. Dany to finally “stitch”.
Not forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
It has supported the sons since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, confirms him.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
Especially that on the other side is Matei, Johan (Kabe) and Adilla (Rami)," he remembers.
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness."
Leekens fondly remembers "wheat."
"Worry" plays "destrian match."
The Constance also claims as a co-chair that France “has become a very high-level team” just one year after the Naizn trauma.
"Loran Blan was like a thunder strike, he's admired.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly on one plane with the guidance of the blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal Pulu Bent started his response match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality in their way.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bent already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the canon, which he has been driving since September 2010, has been assigned to Europe 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia has to be won.
Given that the game is not over on Friday in Hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it was unable to achieve the desired goal to calm it.
"This is a good result, which, however, carries a certain risk."
But, in their brightly lit stadium de la Luss in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which must be in awe, even though the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but thoughtful Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced we can win, "the Portuguese coach said 42-year-old.
"We still have 50% of the chance to go to Europe 2012," was discussed by the successor Carlus Ceiros.
On Friday in the match against Bosnia, the Portuguese are required to win.
Nobody could've built a Bosniaks.
"It's a good result in which there is, however, some risk - it's a pity for Bente.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical virtues and a lot of individual virtues at the players," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "do not give them time to think."
A good idea would only prove to be realistic this time.
