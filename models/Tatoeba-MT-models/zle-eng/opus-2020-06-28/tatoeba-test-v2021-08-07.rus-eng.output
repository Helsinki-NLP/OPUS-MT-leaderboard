A white bird on f3, a black bird on e6, a white bird on g4, a black feck on h4 a mat, is a joke called a "duck mother" in chess circles.
White: A piece of a1, a bird of b6, a king of c8. Blacks: beers on a7 and b7, a king on a 8 and an elephant on b8. White put a rival in a state of sugarmagng, after which the blacks have only two options: to pick up a6 or to move the elephant to any other field of digonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move the bottle from b6 to b7 and put the moms. In the second case, the white system takes a black bird on a 7 with the same result.
