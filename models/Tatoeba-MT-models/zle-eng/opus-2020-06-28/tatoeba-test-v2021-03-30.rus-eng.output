I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you manage to impress Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop bothering him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd smoke.
Stay here with them.
An accident almost cost him his life.
He pushed the bottle off.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Save the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat it while it's hot.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
That's why I said to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week I ran into Boston on Tom's.
Tom's pretty.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to cook.
I told 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what that means?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bike.
I'll pay for it!
Would you like to drive?
I've been doing it all day.
They're peers.
A coin would roll under the table.
She's empty.
Keep your windows warm.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
A caravan of fifty camels was moving slowly through the desert.
You have to be ashamed of your ignorance.
I changed places with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom was unlikely to lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
What are you doing?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get to the house.
Didn't I tell you I was allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to grieve Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He's coming to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
Cosmonauts are wearing scooters.
Algeria buys artillery weapons from Russia.
Can I tell you what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe this?
We slept in the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Shouldn't Tom have done this on October 20th?
I have to go to work right now.
Who's this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Obsession is one of five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch it.
Have you come up with a name for the new-born?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a professional.
I was infected with his cold.
I like Brazil, but I'm going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The fiery grave will be fixed.
The soup is so hot that it can't be eaten.
Why is it so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where'd you get so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friendly.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is not delicious.
Father's in the garden right now.
Harry works part-time at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely I'm late.
I told them to be in their hats.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I once dreamed of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom plans to part with his girlfriend.
Where will you be tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I only knew Tom for a few months.
You are hopeless!
Tom's very good at violin.
No one blames you.
The next year is the year of the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennessee is the only sport that Tom owns well.
Come over to the chair.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so then I fell asleep.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember that I love you.
He's a murderer, he's said.
Mary didn't want to wear a naked suit on Halloween, so she decided to dress like a female amash.
Tom got his hat.
Tom was waiting three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I'm not gonna be like that anymore.
Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's moving.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom going somewhere without me.
I've watched you do it.
He's got a great math ability.
On the road.
He's the father of the new recruit.
Men were men then.
Swiss banks are quite secret.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
It's Christmas.
You want us to do this together?
All of our attempts were in vain.
He poured another glass.
Please, I'm starting to audition the patient now, so make sure you've followed this procedure and you're going to have to do it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the ammo.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary's got?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite filmmaker?
So I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped in with joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I seldom see you with Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan.
This is the house I live in.
I go to school with him.
You see in your face that you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a broken plate.
I can't let him go alone.
It's Tom who broke the window.
By letting them enter the herd of pigs, Jesus demonstrated the permanence of God’s law on unclean animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
It's my birthday.
We need to tell people what to do.
If she's cheap, I'll buy her.
I told him what I had to do.
She almost drowned.
It was a good movie.
Are you cold?
I'll never let you forget this.
Tom prevented me from talking to you.
Who were you going to sell her?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave his anger away.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I've got good reflexes.
Tell me what it was like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like it.
Did you pee?
I know you work for them.
I hope I can help you.
Your parents know about this?
The waiter was on the table for a white table.
I stayed home that day because I was walking by rain.
Is there a pharmacist around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told them that my car had been stolen.
We can discuss it later.
It's a bit helpful.
The cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for the oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet to Mary's forehead.
He's damaged his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to look shy.
Can you tell me anything about yourself?
You found the difference between these two photos?
I've never seen so many books collected in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
Cats have a rough tongue.
I would never do that.
Please fix him.
We've got to put a bag of ice on the ankle to reduce the bucket.
I could show you a city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't have to apologize, you didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here tonight.
"Who are you as a citizen?" -- "Argentinian."
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
Zontic is broken.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't really like Tom.
That's why we're going to have to change plans.
Someone bitten him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
His face was afraid.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can I trust you?
My mother died in an accident.
London is England's capital.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom said he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Get her somewhere.
I was right there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
You can smell that.
Tom's been punctured by deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do this.
I hope I'll see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why it happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't need to.
Look to the left and right before you cross the road.
Tom was a friend of mine.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm really upset.
As is often the case, Mike is late for the meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me Mary had a new guy.
We won't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law prohibiting the law.
It's not done yet.
John said so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to Tom.
There's weird rumors.
I know you're rich.
Bill set aside a hundred dollars for the trip.
He served in the Navy.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom was puking his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more is it to buy?
I'm not hungry.
He got in the car and left.
Tell him everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
That's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom's got his teeth hurt for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies the last one.
It's a girl who came in yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he buy those shoes?
Don't make me do it.
Why did you smile?
Tom usually comes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I used to work with Tom.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often than I see it.
Do I think so alone?
Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him everything he can ask for.
Is it sold?
I'm becoming a bad man.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of blowing a barrel in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They've gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's a little sugar in the bag.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't sit down on someone else's business.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
That's a pretty good point to see.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's frowning.
It's half an hour now.
Left is strong.
I needed to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy's done the hat.
Maybe we should go for a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of cats.
I heard you're good at a gangjo.
Did you read them?
I told 'cause I won't help him.
Tom regrets he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom's terrible in French.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I barely got a train ride.
I don't like to argue.
You like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is behind the hill.
Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pennies!
Mary, are you okay now?
I've fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave The Lady, threw a glass of wine through him, and took a firm step out of the restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We found them.
Tom's gonna steal the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary in private.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Thomas.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any news from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom could swim.
I thought it was time we all met.
It's all Japan's interest.
Tom's really easy to get out of here.
Please just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
This is called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through my senses.
How many U.S. Airfarers?
She's your teacher?
Sing again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need any more.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in the hills in the winter.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably wrong.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why do everyone look at me?
Tom kissed Mary last night.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
All of this seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you waking up?
Get the trash out of here.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy the candles?
Canada is the hockey family on ice.
It's a very complicated organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief through the window.
The spiders are repulsive little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without ears like saltless soup.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
Today, so many things have happened.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm tired.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom kept sucking her.
Six goes to the family.
Today I went to the grave of my grandfather.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom wasn't dancing with Mary.
I saw the man who ate from the garbage tank yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told 'cause he should talk to a lawyer.
Are they on the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got lots of girlfriends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semitism.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like to be pushed.
I wonder when Angelica Agurbash sang a song on Neklaev's words, could she imagine he was going to run for president?
There's yogurt in the refrigerator.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always makes an honest statement.
It's got to be there by two 30s.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he's extremely exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant is burned.
John's not careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took an interview with Mary.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's that guy?
Keep the kids away from the pond.
We'll talk about it tonight.
I have to fix it.
They don't know French.
Get out of here!
I knew what Jackson was doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's starting to get drunk.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still don't feel comfortable.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
It's better red.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for coming.
What did you want to say?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom a word?
Don't be so loud.
When was Tom arrested?
We're going to six.
The deer was a lion victim.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to make her help us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
It may lie in water for ten years, but it will not become a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason but this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always manage to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What a joke!
So you bought it?
Men are as old as they feel, and women as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything looks nice.
Tom told Mary to tell her the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like walking along the river.
You can certainly come with me.
That dictionary is a great gift to us.
"How long till dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent her time working.
Tom got on his motorcycle and got him.
Have you ever had to go to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I was waiting until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes into his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How's French going to be "bye"?
It didn't cost so much.
What's wrong with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not gonna fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend that big amount of money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that each week the world disappears in one language.
She's got a little advantage.
I thought we'd talked about it before.
If only my parents were upset if I had failed.
I'm feeding a cat every day in the morning and in the evening.
Hold your tongue, you're not getting it.
You have to take into account all the implications before making any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite.
I think you did a great job.
Last night, we had a heavy rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I've damaged my hononorrhope.
There's nothing more I can say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come back home early, Bill.
She sat on her chair and read the magazine.
From this point on, it is forbidden to cry.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
Here's the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
It's white, it seems more like a house.
I had trouble finding original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was good.
He only blames others and never blames himself.
Do you know how to play a gangjo?
Tom came over to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you return?" "It depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my building.
I was irritated.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom's probably gonna win.
What would you like Father Christmas to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventure-seeker?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, you have to think of it as a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, work as a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in my hat.
Put it on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There are always huge numbers of vehicles on this road.
You lied to all of us.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's ridiculous to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in something you don't believe in!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
He's sick to everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, it's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom didn't seem to know you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit down with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything besides the Bible?
Read me the score sheet in the boiler.
How does this gentleman earn his living?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Do your parents know that?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to erase the thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
Because of the strike, I had to cancel my trip.
I don't know your name.
How long does the train arrive at Boston?
What words do you have to say to this song?
Mary likes to mock a brother.
The law is on my side.
So I had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was scheduled for the day of the professor’s birth.
You got a phone call while you were in the shower several times.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just a superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
Check, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You're having a birthday.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded on the Internet.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Of course, he is best suited for this work.
You're facilitating my work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know that guy over there?
Tom got out of the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you done lunch already?
Tom and Mary talked for at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you click this button, the door will open.
How many ties do you need?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
I'd show you how to do this.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a bet going on.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I called for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know that's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's taking care of horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They cut Tom off life support.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom's got a lot in common with Mary.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is twice your age.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say that first?
Your grandmother is a beautiful lady.
He wouldn't be able to do that.
I got tired of my 12-hour trip.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do it.
He came back two days later.
Tom had a breakfast.
We must be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help Tom wash the windows?
It's beyond my competence.
That was yesterday.
I love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm the only one here.
Don't tell him what really happened.
I'm not gonna just give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these cards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone this dictionary.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary's.
I didn't have time today to do this.
Mary told him she'd help him.
A multiple number from "person" is "tople", not "persons".
It's two steps.
You ruined it!
I think that's why I had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me the name of the baby.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everybody's got weaknesses.
I hope you're well paid.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
That book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed people sleep there day and night.
I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom cried out and ran out of the room.
That soup's fishing.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in coffee.
Did you not know that I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, spoke in terms of the Jews, of the Gallei dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the insolence of allegations of a sacred language, the use of which in prayers is particularly close to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for that.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you for something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him drinking in the shower.
You remind me of my youth.
Tonight's Tom's on duty.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up quickly.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Recreation is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
She had a good idea in her head at the last moment.
There's a very cold air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweater tonight?
A pound is one weight.
I wouldn't be talking to him again.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very hard.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
Stitches are routine.
Who else are on your list?
Don't let me have my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going to go with.
I wish I knew what to say to them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics at Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He was rocking in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom learned Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do this.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said that there would be days like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
Nobody could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day came to an end, thanks to your timely efforts, the people who tried to help you in your labors were not in danger.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your men to drop their weapons.
There's a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's trying his best.
Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't figure it out.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get himself to the hospital.
I sat next to Tom.
You have a bad voice.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think it's a great benefit to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half a third.
It's not God's message of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
You want a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the threshold of starving death.
I've learned so much on my mistakes that I think I can do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The Futballist hit the ball.
This book is good for sale.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do it.
Positive atomics attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my feet.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not good.
Come here.
The guest gave me an account of 8,000 yen by number.
I stopped chasing the fashion.
Tom has allergies.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Does Tom have one?
I finally got to work.
Tom's in the kitchen, having a dish.
The temperature has dropped by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
That car is good for sale.
I need to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words upset me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what you should've done.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response was awesome.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I have to go now.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I've got a little bit of a dream.
That's why there's nothing to do with anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzook.
Tom was sleeping in his backyard with all the trees.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you very much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I'm sure I understand.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.
What are you just here?
It's nice.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't have listened to my advice.
You want to say something to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell 'cause we're late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There's a big organ in this cathedral.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the sweater.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone higher than me.
How much is the hotter?
I want to drink something cold.
What difference does it make to you?
Every nation has its own special character.
Healthy people don't know the value of health.
Did I miss anything interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The public was running out of laughter.
You're not paying attention to me.
My ankle's broken.
You like taking pictures, don't you?
He is a noble knight without fear or fear.
They hate women.
I don't have any tunes with me.
Tom was trying to escape.
What color does she have?
Go quickly!
You overstate him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around me.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaii is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was here first?
Do you sing to the choir?
You were home last night?
I was homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices will go down.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I never hurt anyone.
It wasn't by accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's screaming at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom used to say that Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very pretty.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog swearing in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need actions, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You're just running away from problems.
A womanless bird like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the kid alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I put a drink on the hook.
Don't leave points on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's overrun.
I've seldom met her.
I know it's really important.
I eat an apple.
Tom learns as well as the other boys in their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for soldiers.
What happens if we get caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm going to take care of your bedroom tonight.
He has five languages.
Tom had a hard childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There's no one like Bill among the boys.
Should we go?
I knew I could trust you!
Tom took the wood into the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Did you ask Romeo and Juliet?"
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't leave her.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
No Tom or Mary never went to Boston.
Have you ever had a salon?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school right now?
Let us know, please.
Tom coughed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because of the lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can trust me.
There's a lot of puzzles in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple rot.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think about you every day until I'm gone.
It was a bad bet.
Thinking that she was coming alone was bothering me.
The river's worth it.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He's sure to come.
You got a message?
Last night Tom called.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I decided to give up.
A private case took them by their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you get the towel?
Tell 'cause I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understood French.
Tom was on a bus going to Boston.
She's falling, she's got a elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
You're being called.
You both made a big impression today, I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you're doing with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
The weather can't rely on anything at all.
She's still young.
Did you obey Tom's advice?
Tom says he's a cutter.
How's your father?
They said when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money on his new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't need it anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer pepper eggs.
She lives in Muchosransk.
People who are not smarter than me don't care about me.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
These are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser led a brand with a beam in all three of the nets they had given them.
I can't come with you because I'm very busy.
A kilogram of fig is worth two and a half euros.
A lot of animals in a zoo?

What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What kind of floor does Tom live on?
There's no direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me some hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an assignment for Tom.
"How's the accident?" "No one knows."
What do you like about him?
When I arrived at the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.
She's running.
It's a man.
If it were Icelandic, I think it'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting will be?
I'd like them to be happy.
I want to leave the job.
Many followers of the Christian congregation.
The ravens are absorbing the sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
It must be Tom's place.
Tom's a weird kid.
Belle was invented in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you're working a lot.
I love Uralian.
I hope you're mistaken on this score.
Sometimes it is necessary to speak the truth.
Tom's a perplex.
I have a proposal for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are gonna get married on 20 October.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who'd want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's sitting there until late night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we can do.
I'm proud of them.
I only got home.
Tom's burning in his oven both wood and coal.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't make fun of her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God had a preconceived match between Jesus Christ’s royal authority and the priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went to our home.
It's thin, but it's strong and it doesn't break.
It's a little stupid.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
It's unbelievable.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five on TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Tell me, please, where you'll live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I'm not beautiful.
Do you often cry?
We did not expect such results.
I've read that before.
If the car breaks down, let's walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
They're all doing it.
I often go to visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You should be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She's got to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The driver entered the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I'm leaving.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God’s help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
It's dark.
I get whatever I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown in the bath.
Tom and I are the same growth.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Maria's younger brother.
You act like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
The book's big.
Don't say that about Tom.
I kind of made it clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time may change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year Tom will be teaching French.
I've listened to her.
I told him to rest.
Why are you mad?
The worst part of the trip is in the back.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do it!
That knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
You'll only have a minute.
That's the situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They won't come back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in my wheel.
He never survived.
Don't you want to come with us?
Tom's swimming?
Just tell them what you need.
We're gonna leave as soon as possible.
He drove down the skiers to Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read your book." "I see, my censorship spell still works."
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding from your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing as you.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join me.
Tom wanted to ask Mary again for forgiveness.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He never was.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do it.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go faster, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom doesn't leave.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they get you out of here?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
It was difficult to make that decision.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
So we didn't have to go.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat can harm your health and the environment.
You tell me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to shut up for me.
No one loves me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
Did you tell him?
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something.
Sahara is the world’s largest dust source.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is weeping iva.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom got both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
A strong wind back at night.
The ants and the giraffes are extended relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was wearing two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to know me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to going to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
What Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the sweetest pear I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do this.
She's not mine.
You know what this is?
Tatva is the capital of Canada.
Tom never was late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard to accept you.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'm starting this.
I said let them go.
When's the beginning?
There's no business before she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom."
When will you wash the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane's leaving at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I love traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared into the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom had fun with Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
That's the lesson that's not over!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's a smug.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
I thought he was gonna kiss me.
Don't hit me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I work.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why would Tom get mad?
What a terrible man!
The carton's running paper.
Don't be angry with him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
The great Tom was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, isn't he?
She damaged her back by playing tennis.
Tom's easily scared.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What are you waiting for Tom to do?
She seemed completely calm.
Click on the button.
Tom went from Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was going on.
Mary wore boots to her knees.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do it tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's really bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can get you on the way to the job.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was the first.
Everything's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree down there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said good-bye to the sister.
My mother was busy preparing dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pears have long arms.
Tom was in his dresses.
There's a bench underneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How about my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary were looking so hard.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom's often playing guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom seldom wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't want to go.
I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.
Tom has a cable?
Whatever you say, I'm not going to change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank you for your help.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring disaster to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You need to try not to fall asleep.
Mom's been very helpful to me.
Tom's got a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me on a mistake.
What's the name of this dog?
Come on to the sidewalk.

Don't pay attention to them.
I know you don't like me.

I'm not as happy as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning on buying a house?
The cat's on the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to come with me to Australia.
He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.

Sometimes a small gift can be a great expression of love.
Do you prefer a blonde or a blonde?
I didn't get on the bus.
So you didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll get someone to help me.
Why didn't you tell us that before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Squeeze.
I'm making progress.
You're pale like a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
It's not that French.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sitting there.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not gonna marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Are you going on a train?
We believe so too.
How could something like this happen?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and feet are always dead.
How can I translate words which are not in any language except mine?
Could you bind that with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's really pissed at me.
I used to wash my head once a week.
Eleven is a prime number.
I'm not lying to you.
Coffee for my account.
We're husband and wife.

Tom was impotent.
In October, leaves begin to fall.

What upset you?
Now I'm too busy talking to you.

Where are you going?
A third of the prisoners escaped.
Praise be to Allah!
You think Tom knows?
This time I cry.
Tom acted like a kid.
Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were an romantic.
I saw you spy on Tom.
I need you to do it right away.
The driver entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary's been working most of her life.
The guy Mary's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have to admit something.
It was expected that Tom would be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"You speak Greek?" "No, it's my first lesson."
Why did you give him money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do this more.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you do it?
I've been to Apple.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for the plane.
She's always up early.
Do you want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We were in the deepest room.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
When do we have a woman president?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did this.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
It's the cookie I've been running for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never have done that.
I suggest you try harder.
That dog's not scared of a baby.
Don't resist.
Tom has keys.
When I have a bad mood, I like to think about the mountainous people to get dressed up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do anything he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us the jokes.
The Luke can be used in many of the dishes.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
A lightning hit the tree.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the mat.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it hard to teach Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Have you seen anybody else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put it down.
Tell him he won't get caught.
We looked into the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I work from morning till night.
How long are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going on with Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He took a kiss to the bird.
Tom's going to be released on Monday.
Fuck you!
I have to go.
She had her nose tied to the glass.
English does not differ between ser and estar.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have a great English.
Is there any message for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing SMS using the car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you scrape your beard?
I want to get back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The shell was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke to me first.
Did you ask Fom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should explain to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's time to heal.
Why do you always take sides with him?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All the men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't let that happen.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told 'cause you came to Australia.
You were looking for it?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I really was worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were stuck with snowstorms.
The book on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What are we going to lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never responded to his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom wanted us to stay.
I'm in the stairs.
It's the largest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did that.
What weather is it?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You won't introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told 'cause Mary needs to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you enjoy living outside the city?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's head.
Who are you planning on going to Australia?
Someone was yelling.
What's better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train goes to three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than I am.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you were told.
Please look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't get into your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma's got away from the door.
My dad's a English teacher.
For Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to the pearl.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate it into French.
How many barrels on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Maybe.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who's Tom?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
I am!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only philosophy can use the vicious circle in evidence and receive appreciation for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I was speaking to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't make the fools understand their own language.
Should I leave?
I was so stupid I believed it.
She did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, my mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
They're cute.
Tom's illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French complex, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger was mine.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was irritated.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there earlier than he is.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
How much time is Tokyo now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you with Tom.
Where did you get your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll be snow this year for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I owe one of my friends a tent.
I'll work for you until you pay me as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would have done.
You won't have a second chance like this.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay me.
She's sick.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's got Mary looking for her hair.
Tom didn't show me happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom eats sushi regularly with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the most lazy one I know.
Mary already got into her room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a scoundrel.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuela.
Here's the score.
He hurt me publicly.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnetics are used in in Industrialization plates for direct heating of the gravitum and pancreas.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Come out immediately.
Can I see your rights?
I'll take you 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I certainly didn't know where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I've got two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's been looking for the pale.
He took a few letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much does that cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes taking care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left that note.
You're a Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom with half a third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did someone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom is kind.
She played sleepy.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
Infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll ever say thank you.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network's huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not anxious.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought it was.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say it's a very interesting movie.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for the heavy rain.
Apparently she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love bitter peppers.
How much do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There's no winners.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're stuck.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was there snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to a beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defence.
How does faith differ?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll get to the top of the mountain.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His heart was pale and sparkled, and his pale face was usually alive and covered with Romanian.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands fell asleep from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it with caution.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
That man was put to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children enjoy playing more than learning.
He was accepted for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of a fight.
In a few days, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it gets dark.
I wasn't expecting to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did you get into fashion all of a sudden?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our grandson was born yesterday.
Tom's got a pirate suit.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the bee.
What do these people do?
I did what I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom has to be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I should have invited Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I'll sweat every day.
She became an e-mail.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need cabs.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that man is the one he betrays himself for?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinezubius, led to Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
Tom could've stayed a little longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom's very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hess.
In fact, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought before the courts, it is common for the jury to have twelve people.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started seeing each other.
The boys were marching four in a row.
Tom was very excited.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized there was something wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
There's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He got hurt when he was falling.
We're impartial.
I've got some cuisines all over my hand.
Tom, come on, hurry up, we'll be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
You're following your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You may not be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is known globally by his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear present.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like those spirits?
Castle's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Help yourself with the cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I've got three French-English Slovaks.
Let go, Sergeant.
No one can do this.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want better.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from underestimation?
Was it too simple?
What Alice faced in anticipation of her reply was a sudden fight, a loud noise, so sharp that she could break up her drums, and so loud that she could reach the sky.
I lost it in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go in there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she wanted from him.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried harder to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That rock was so heavy I couldn't raise it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it turns out, it will.
We got a cano.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look high on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed onto a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I would come back.
Tom's got the youngest.
Welcome to the Real World!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I strongly believe in his innocence.
The President is in office for four years.
I'm glad you're glad.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can't you have solved that question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would you do that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know, by any chance, when Tom comes back?
I don't have Tom's photographs.
Can you wait a little longer?
You're gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind got up.
Tom had no courage to jump with his ass.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn like an ass.
I think I can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a premonition that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom spoke in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but some girl took the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must adhere to the plan.
I'll tell 'cause you called.
Tom's very strict about kids.
How's the negotiations going?
He's ready for worse.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayones with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got little boobs.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't get mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
So a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this the safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect that that's why we should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in another land.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Famine was an abstract concept; it always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, there was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of a rat?
How long do you want to go?
She was sick of her feet.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom bowed forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I've never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do this much.
I hope we don't do this anymore.
How many times did you help because of that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be an opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good at animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom included a flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Foma's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't have thought of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a little more.
What are you doing?
You can make butter, cheese, and so forth.
You don't have the power to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Make yourself comfortable.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unassigned guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as they expected.
He jumped in.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Did you not ask for Tom's help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say it in a human language?
No one was hungry except for me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake is guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.

Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A drawer with holes.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.

I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, you're eating.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of this right now.
I don't trust her.
Six times three is eighteen.
“Scale” is an anagram for “salka”.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.

It's unbelievable.

He said he'd come back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Zelenka.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.

I can rest.
Tom won't mind.
Nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country’s officials.

That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train's waiting at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think is safe?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the boy who drew this painting.

In a big town like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not driving.
As it turned out here, it is now impossible to know.
Tom now has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
Lots of voices were fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.

I know that for sure.

So quiet.

You better hide.
Tom should be instructed.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What color do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just came back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told me not to do it.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have some coffee in that coffee coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself and started waving my hands.
I'm with you.

You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I'm impressed with your courage.
Tom was hoping Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're hopeless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do with Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working this weekend.
Tell her, please, I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's attempts to introduce more stringent arms control have been prevented together by an influential weapon lobby.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've got enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud that my father's a good cook.
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation to Macha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have one.
No one paid attention to me.
So there were 13 at that time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay for it.
You made coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually speak too fast.
We both speak French.
You can find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he showed his triumph.
Why was he looking for Tom?
It's capital investment.
Really bitter.
Time didn't have enough time to do that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to know.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network, overrun.
I once lived on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
Thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks can find a lot of information about a person before they meet him.
What actually happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think those ink stains can be brought out.
I told you everything I should have told you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive him.
Tell me you're kidding me!
I'm realistic.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends that I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in uniform?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleaned the street from snow.
Tom and Mary have to do it together.
They offered us their help.
Tom Turno decided to kiss Macha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are good friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The picture's hanging on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom's with you?
The boy's scared of the dark.
That's why I made dinner.
Russia has become a second superpower.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Read that powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those finished lunches sold at the station.
Tom was trying to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in position.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for the Manhattan apartment is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy that car?
You speak like my grandmother.
I don't have my own brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think it's a precise translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to be done here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't get your hand in the door.
You have to consider his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to keep going.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn the radio off?
I definitely don't remember what Tom said.
Tom's a brilliant player.
I wasn't ready for this.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday you left the bar just at the moment I was going to put all the drinks at my expense.
Tom told me it really worked.
I want to play chess.
I support you a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate to wait.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
Yesterday was fun.
Where did Tom get these pictures?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom got him off his feet.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage money.

I almost don't know anything about that.
Why are you moving to Boston?
Tom's not content.

We can talk.
I think we're looking for different things.
Stop, I don't want to do this.
Sit down.
I bought a camera like you.
Did you drink wine?
She bought a few books in the bookbook.
Mary said she doesn't work Mondays.
Put two sticks on each other.
She's just like a baby.
Where would I buy a T-shirt like that?
Tom and Mary want us to do this.
It's not my fault I hate them all.
It's snowing today.
It's time.
Write me if you need help.

Tell him everyone's here.
Where can I find an interpreter?

The danger ahead.
It's like where Greek gods hanged, isn't it?

Tom bit the bee.
I just want you to leave.
You think she's still reading my messages?

So you shouldn't have said that to Mary.
Get out of my car.

What would you do if you were in my position?
Is your mother smoking?
You'll call Tom.
We can look at this problem from several sides.
She never saw her brother again.
Tom didn't stand up and burst into tears.
Aren't you a Catholic?
I wanted to take part.
You think Tom's happy?
You don't have to talk here.
Tom and I often give each other gifts.
I have two sons and two daughters.
I know you did it on purpose.

I'm glad you told me.
No one can blame you for being a little scared.
No one wants to help them.
Tell him what to take.
Mary ate what she wanted.
I'll be on your side.
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
I'll tell you what you said.
Where's her offer?
Please punish him.
Tom listens to the radio at breakfast.
Two doctors were talking about business and their work.
So I wanted to cry.
How much are you paying for that?
How many fruits do you eat?
Tom knows how much did you pay for that?
It's very hot here.
You're talking in a dream.
Tom taught Mary how to drive.
I'm just doing what I'm doing.
Why do you lie to them?
Why don't you take your coat off?
I have to leave early tonight.
Actually, I was lonely.
He seems to like her.
Tom checked the files carefully.
I just found it tonight.
Where can I buy it?
How long will it take to go to the zoo?
I watched Tom swim.
We need to find him.

I should have stayed with her.

I'm smarter than them.
How do we find her?
You're not fired.
I don't have any business right now.

I need to see them.
What are you planning to do?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's too small.
I'll wait for you.
Do you understand what that means?
Tom waited for everyone to sit down.
You and your friends are invited.
Tomorrow he's playing tennis.
I saw your sister yesterday.

I'm waiting for you across the door.

Sooner or later she's admitted.
I needed him.
Is there any mail in here?

I need a cashock.
Nobody's talking to me anymore.
Their meeting was inevitable.
I did it for you and Tom.
I don't think Tom knows Mary wants him to buy her.

Tom thought Mary was having fun.
I don't have time to worry about these little things.
You know Tom's mother?
I'm not told where we're going.

Tom has to tell the truth.
Don't go to the park at night!
Tom doesn't use Facebook.
I can't talk about it quietly.
You'll make mistakes.

It doesn't matter.
You can always rely on Tom.
Tom sent these flowers.
I'm still worried about this.
I went to a party.
Will you be paying cash?
It's gonna be okay, don't be afraid!
How could you be such a fool?
Are you all crazy?
You should have been there.
Dad quit drinking.
Mary says she's allergic to boys.
You're wrong, I didn't say that.

Ask Tom when he plans to return.
As far as I know, Tom's retirement.
Why don't people in Australia walk up their feet?
I doubt Tom and Mary are still at home.
I don't want to bother you.

I was in love.
Take off your shoes.
Mary lost her purse.
He was so poor he had nothing to buy.

Who started all this?
We're not gonna go together.
His name's "Stay-to-be."
It's complicated.
What must be done?
I heard the sky is very beautiful.
Did you get my letters?
Tom told the anecdot.
Hey, Mimi, what's up?
I don't have much free money.
I'm sorry for you.
They're idiots.
What a beautiful girl he is.
Mary said she was alone.
Tom lost control.
I was mad at myself.
The boys aren't afraid of him.
You're always calling me from her house.
I called him from the hospital.
You're not like the picture in life.
Turn right at the next corner.
Several students are not available today.
I was scared of just thinking about it.
My parents are Spanish.
I've known him for years.
Tom asked Mary to turn the lights off.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20.
He's just doing what I'm telling him.
I hope Tom is arrested.
I sat down on my elevator and I put a button on my floor.
That was promising.
I'm glad to hear that.

She told me she didn't eat pigs.
Now you can come out of the room.
Tom learned a new word.
She spoke French.
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
Where did she find that book?
Have you received news from your sister lately?
You need to have breakfast.
So what do you want to know?
Tom didn't go, and so am I.
Choose expressions.
He just came back.
Mary laughed funny.
You're gonna have to wait here.
I'm tired of listening to your complaints.
Tom and Mary, as usual, lost their time.
Please tell them it's urgent.
You'd be fine for this job.
How's Tom doing?
We gave her some apples.
I'm not.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you describe Tom briefly?
I should have told Tom to wait.
Please wish me luck.
I'm glad I'm alive.
Tom was waiting for me at the parking lot.
I didn't want to bring him to tears.
I saw Mary before she saw me.
I'm sorry I told him that.
Tom told me he really wanted to eat.
Maybe I'll never walk again.
Do you know how to collect a Rubik's cube?
My weight is fifty-eight kilograms.

I didn't give it to that one for Christmas.
I'm an Englishman.
You won't fool me with that trick.
What kind of sport do you like?
She reads.
Tom doesn't know why I'm afraid.
Go straight along this road.
It's winter soon.
My grandfather was a soldier in the war.
I was there when Tom died.
Did Tom have a lunch yet?
You can buy a train ticket.
I'm very proud of my parents.
I've been kidding before.
I don't know if Tom has a bicycle or not.
Don't make me lose my patience.
I love a lot.
I don't think you have to do it yourself.
Tom is really dangerous.
It's not his wife.
We're not gonna be done again.
How long do I have to wait?
I don't think I need permission to do that.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through your nose.
Look at this from her point of view.
Tom's the only one who didn't swim.
He's got a literary talent.
God can do it!
Bring the kids.
Tom thought you knew Mary.
Tom knew I wouldn't do it.
I was very lucky.
Tom's got a bad mood tonight.
I didn't mean to hurt them.
He looks weird.
Do you have any victims?
I spend a lot of time building air locks.
We all love you.
Here and now.
I'm not very disappointed.
I don't smoke or drink.
She's in charge.
The police haven't questioned Tom yet.
I knew you didn't have enough money.
Critics are not to be avoided.
Please tell me it's not a bomb.
I don't want to touch Tom.
I went on a train.
I applauded.
I forgot to pour flowers.
Tom took things and left.
She's been talking about you all the time.
I respect you and Tom.
I fell asleep in the train.
Tom made his own decision.
I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're impotent.
Tom's brushing his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was able to talk to women.
Let's determine our whereabouts before we go any further.
She called me the next day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for three hundred dollars.
What did that mean?
You should have told me in advance.
I've got a crossman in my garden.
He's looking for a job.
I'm looking for my cat.
I should have asked her first.
Have fun!
Who ate all the cookies?
We'll fix him.
Mary finally found her keys.
That information strengthened him in his opinion.
The worst enemy and man's best friend is another man.
Tom wanted Mary to prepare him for something to eat.
Don't wait for my dinner.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm sorry, I'll be back for a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what should be done.
I know it won't happen today.
I don't think it changes anything.
We took a break at the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom smiled politely.
Rabbits can swim.
I have some money with me.
Our team has a good chance of winning.
One square meter of solar battery produces about one watt of energy, so it is not easy to use solar energy on a large scale at this time.
Who knows why Tom lied?
This car's new?
I have one question for you.
It took me ten minutes to get out of here.
Who are you to decide?
Rinse the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you tonight.
What do you have plans for the weekend?
We can get caught.
I'm sure he'll go.
Go ask him.
Let me see.
Private charity is just a drop in the sea.
I agreed to have a drink with Tom after work.
I wish I had such a car.
I became a woman.
Tom hasn't slept since yesterday.
Fortunately, Tom had an extra umbrella.
Why did you shave the beard?
These manual items vary in quality.
Tom came over to Mary.
Tom's not used to this job.
She suffers from renal failure.
Give me a flashlight.
Did you say that because he shouldn't go?
Nothing like ice cream in summer.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.
Mary knows she was wrong.
It's a little bit too close.
We'll try to keep calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke quickly.
So you didn't have to deceive Mary.
The baby's in the wheelchair.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom's the manager of the offer and rewritten it.
You could have got hurt.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you're working.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary didn't let him.
Tom didn't do anything all week, but he complained to Mary's back.
I don't think I can do anything with my bare hands.
Tom approved?
I'd like to be a Canadian.
It only happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.
Nobody wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You are free to deal with your money as you wish.
Do you want anything?
She left before I came home.
Tom wasn't the only one arrested.
You could at least knock!
You're doing everything worse.
I think you should rest a bit.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee we'll be able to finish our work by next Monday.
I didn't do it very well.
That's why you really need it.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papiamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to cut myself off.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember their name?
I eat bit.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom's changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine is good for sale.
Her clothes attracted much attention at the party.
Tomorrow they're gonna get married.
She was right and he's wrong.
They made lots of lots of people to go first.
Maybe we should ask him if he's on his way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like spending time with my friends.
I didn't know you Canadians.
If you take the kid out and show him a finger on the moon, the kid will look at the moon, and if you do the same thing with the dog, she'll look at your finger.
Tom took his beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know Tom was unhappy.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
The economic crisis will take place at the end of this year.
Do not let anyone near the fire.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary a letter he received from John.
"Palms are boring," said the girl.
I want one, too.
Tom used to teach me French.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the windows.
Can this be acceptable to you?
How am I going to get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I suggest I stop here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do this.
She's got a very busy schedule.
Tom also speaks French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
There were tiger leagues in the garden.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do this.
We have come to wish you good luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Jealer!"
He's got one goal in life, making money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Grandpa Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
She said she liked him.
I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom was staying at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's unreserved.
Nuclear Batton!
I'll leave my departure if it's raining.
Everything must be irreprehensible.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
This is the highest building I've ever seen.
It makes me hear.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
You're a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The three main flowers are mixed in black.
You'll be all right.
What time do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want the neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
How long will Tom still be in the hospital?
I want you to come with her.
I'll make him pay for the money.
You have to respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I'll pray diligently.
What will you do if the war starts again?

You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We're terribly missed because of that.
He told his parents.
Tom, you already ate?
Who did you give it to?
I was holding him behind the collar.
No one invites you to do this.
I forgot it was April one.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom bit the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I understand the consequences.
The river is divided into the eastern and western part of the city.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
So it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom is guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do this.
If the ice heats up, it'll melt.
We could do that.
The doctor said he needed an operation.
I just changed toothpaste.
That's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to visit you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with triumph.
I'm going alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I was listening to him.
What are you up to?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do this!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust fall.
Why are you so stiff?

Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm almost every day on my head.
To my surprise, he didn't pass the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself an advocate of superiority over a white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use her phone.
Tom's better cooking than I am.
He's swimming like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to buy it.
She brought me the broom.
"Too, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to a concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father is waiting for you.
How long can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus minus gives a plus.
In the basement there's a corpse.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ancar, the capital of Turkey.
I went to the laundry.
I prefer a more simple approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech was very encouraging.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look improbable.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is a recognition that you didn't even know you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought well before you made her pregnant.

I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's lost his mind.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in town?
The interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
He didn't seem sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There are so many of them.
He could not compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You must have got three gone for this.
That was a simple solution.
Mary said it would be early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You're still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a canad.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is endowed with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
That's all about work.
I didn't have anything wrong in my mind.
Tom maintains purity in his room.
These three books belong to the One.
He jumped from one topic to the next.
It's a armistice.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly wore Tom's shirt.
Looks like a bank robbery was planned up to fine.
That's why he didn't like it, but he still bought it.
Just stay a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was shopping in the river.
Tell them to pull the phone off.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't force me to kill you!
How much do you like?
They don't respect him.
No choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't be angry with us.
You can't answer that.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish alligator from crocodile?
Wait, is that what?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell 'cause you're the one who killed his father?

I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower this morning?
All right, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
The nation, counting on it to remain in ignorance and free, is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs do not distinguish color.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are right animals.
Tom's house was almost destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
There's two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
Let's say he doesn't do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a look.
Come closer.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I thought I'd wait for Mary.
She always complained that she had no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary works in her room.
All attention!
That very second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone into the forest alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom's been asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
Tom has never kissed anyone.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'm listening.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom never went to Boston.
She had learned to dive when she was five years old.
We complained to the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need that.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As you meet the new year, you'll have it done.
There's no book in the library in French.
Every synthesis is dangerous, especially such.
You could've stayed in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write it down with a hiragan, please?
We don't think it matters.
Nobody understands you the way I do.
Be age-old, then.
Do you know how to hunt?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I don't have any kind of suffering for animals.
I think Dadaeba's stopping tonight.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
In Mary's apartment, he's a total mess.
The conference room is now busy.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mys isn't as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's a dead end here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You spoke so often yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The original satellite was launched into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What will happen to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He's got a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me about it.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account must be paid for the first number of the next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You scare her.
Boston is a cold town for me, not that Chicago.
Tom was a victim of an attempt at extortion.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
My back was over with a fight.
I didn't take him, you can check his pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave the feedback.
You chose the wrong man.
They were very risky.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't at home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a truck with mud on the road.

I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was not easy to find.
Everyone dances!
I live with Tom.
Here I met them.
You don't waste your time.
Your problem is you don't have patience.
Several events marked the coming of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be a word.
He got out of bed.
The trains go according to schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are a lot of people who think it's impossible not to get confused.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What makes you feel motivated?
Leila gave her own computer.
Roll up your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
It's said that anyone in America could become president, but that's probably not the case.
Tom never forgot Mary.
Tom's name on the list is the first one.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long does the train arrive?
How long does this train arrive at Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I got him a cookie.
This is a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come last night?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think about it.
Move it to French, please.
Get off the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew fast.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Spaces and kill them.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's everyone's favorite.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
So he'll have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his back beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half a Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, it's easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is 13th?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here familiar with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad avenues in this town.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do that.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I'm not gonna let her in.
Our neighbors were there to talk to us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has shortcomings.
I wonder why it's necessary.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you not like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
You have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
Titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting went on.
I know you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
Don't you remember anything?
I need cash.
Get him a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Come on!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're going to get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cabist when he was in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did my best to help Tom.
I'm joining you with her.
She got the highest grades.
Tom might have a bit of a fight.
I think you're gonna be very busy tonight.
What color do you have as a child?
I left in a hurry.
I work for society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the houseboy.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me a note sheet or something.
I don't want to get out of the house.
He'll be here tonight.
The cat's dead.
It's only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in that lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She took her hands to warm them.
Tom said he was glad you'd come back.
My car's covered with blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make this mistake again.
I don't care if we stay.
I told her to marry him.
I've been waiting all my life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the test?
The plane went into the train station.
It wasn't him.
Do you have correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read that book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do it for you.
"Hi," Tom babbly said.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm sick of everything.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long it is.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the valueess.
You don't need to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new proposal is like a message in a bottle that will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
You've all been loved.
We're family souls with him.
I've got your age's granddaughter.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She's starting to get fresh in her new office.
Let us take care of that.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do this yesterday.
It's a little early drinking, isn't it?
My parents don't like my dress manner.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
That's not good enough.
Can I take you by the arm?
He's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom hasn't been down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the magic.
The show should start looking after all the seasons are off!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go skiing?
You were in a hairdresser?
The prospect of a debauched future.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to know what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture.
I failed at the exam.
Everyone knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The Futballist made a huge mistake.
Will they come too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to release the brake.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The blast blew up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they embraced her.
It's my cat.
Have you got any kids yet?
Tom didn't want to breakfast.
That's why they like it.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom's a self-deceptive idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks throwing out products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road here is bending right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved dramatically.
Let's go to church.
Tom died scotch.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I haven't met him before.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
You know that boy crying?
Nobody knew.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The one who steals the cow is also a cow.
Tom's not a good swimr, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of the former.
How are we doing this?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to take me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily's lips?
Why don't you go in there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stay together.
I've only heard of him as good.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not going to be compared to us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'm never taking out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV program?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
My God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll go back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm gonna come home tonight.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer kept stealing from his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm just thinking about trying things like this.
I don't know much about hunting.
For the first time, I cook meat for the flu.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was kind of sceptic.
Tom has to be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I'll hang up every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple sour.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus kidnapped the sacred fire at the gods.
Welcome to the Physic world.
I'd like us to spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers were able to get out of the bus before he lit up.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Hey, you're so bored here" -- "My dear, I want everything to do for this world" -- "Here and I'm your Majesty, Ghenon and his servants captured the island of Korea." -- "Hmm, what can we --" -- "How can we tell, "It's just that Link can beat the Ganga." -- "So we can."" -- "Suddenly, "I'll take my sword," "I'm not." --" -- "Much!" -- "No, "No!" --" -- "No, "What's wrong with the skull." -- "No" -- "No." -- "How's this gun?" -- "Yes!
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you on Sunday at three.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at this.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going to Tom's home.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary make a blanket.
A is a lot consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you wanted to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's how they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during Louis XVI’s reign.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
That will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was bitten by a hand.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffee, please.

Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
That's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your glasses.
Rainwater flows through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm the kind of girl who's more friends with the guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom's gonna be here with me.
My father has a hard time giving up drinking.
No one's suggesting you do that.

Tom left Mary.
Tom started laughing.

Tom has telepathic powers.
Who is he?
Tom was sitting with John in one cell.
I didn't want to swim.
He drunk a beer.
In our time, it's harder for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Toma wake up!
I'll keep my nose jackets off.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She got out of her mind and yelled at me.
Did you take your medication?
The hares are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What are you trying to tell them?
We'll take her home.
You smell like a green rubber?
It didn't happen here.
When's your dad coming home?
I understand.
Tom's got Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my heart.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're clearly tired.
We're champions.
Tom's sick.
Tom said it's not enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?

I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What chemical mark is methyl bromide?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
It's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, even though I disagree with many of them.
The skyfly is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater to him.
I don't think Tom wants to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls, is it cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning to stay?
We were successful in eating and then left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal you eat from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The little girl was open.
I brought wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I'd like to meet you to death.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's drive a car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered how his lips would taste.
A good trainer trains this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was detained because of severe snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left my hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do this or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom was going to be disappointed with me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Because he was winter, he didn't go outside.
On the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are there on your street?
Blondes are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's a bit slow.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
It is the only positive quality that we have.
My Hobby is collecting insects.
Tom's child lived in Boston.
I didn't eat for six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been praying all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I went further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very friendly, and she's having a nice smile.
I'm not gonna let her die.
In all cultures, babies go to sleep on their own.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Sorry to upset you.
He who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've included imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
I'm sorry, I got you wrong.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
I'm with her peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said, happened?
Could you leave the door open?
It's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he made was wrong.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Thomas do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I go to France once, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, I was about noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
Wait stopped. You can open windows again.
I've never had this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna come out when I called the phone.
I don't have to tolerate it.
Always get down the road to the right.
We're asked to come in line.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can throw you away if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was was was was was wasting her time.
Do you still have this problem?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice as a melodious song of sirens.
What is it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting really better.
How do I get my passport?

Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
Big Foma?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how I've been doing?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't need anyone to trust me.
She's a worshiper of Sex in a Large City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get him along well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing like a beer glass after a long day's work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here's some interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's take a breath here.

Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
Why are we living for?
Will it be raining today?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't drive a car often.
So you don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for his forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school, then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you join us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

He came up and stood on his knees.

Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom is a little bit more than Mary.
He looks like nobody knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue's coming to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's winter time.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.

Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his guitar.
Now I'm married.

You don't believe her?
English is a universal language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston when you were a kid?
Tell them what I told you.

Why would you need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's divided.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or they'll arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom set himself up as a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to create a short story.
A room without books like a body without a soul.
What is the sin on us?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression on her.
You're old enough to do this yourself.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.

I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?

She always writes letters.
I don't know who I'm gonna consult.
Turn the left to the corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I won't have to get the wrong kids out of here.
It's Tom who bought me.

I assume you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At Bob's next school festival, the first time Bob's main role will be played.
You must remain in shape.
I've been eating seeds all day.
At the accent, I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Compassionate!
Tom's closed up.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
You know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me that he was very happy.
My dad's gradually growing up.
You'll feel like home.
It won't end well!

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" -- "American Politicalist."
Get out of here!
If it's not a house-to-house sale, maybe it's a new way of getting to know girls?
Tom got a coin.
Why didn't you go into your room?
If there's no God, it's all allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New one?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please stick your belts during takeoff and landing.
That was why and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting for it for a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll have too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build it yourself?
I'm looking forward to a summer vacation.
Can I speak that differently?
From here he looks great.
Woodhouses are easily inflamed.
Let's make it a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed's very comfortable.
I'll report it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a little out of breath.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I eat something?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the soup.
What bird can't fly?
This must stop.
Tom didn't answer immediately.
Tom died at seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom said so in French.
The invention of a transistor marked a new era.

I hate spinach.
Mother prepares lunch.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He is inclined to give his emotions free.
We were shocked to report his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You just notice the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the fault of what happened.
He's been running like an hour.
I know where you're going.
You're gonna grab everything for summer.
Let's get him down.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaner interrupted the conversation.
The cat's on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not lying anymore.
Tom was a smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him steal a snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did this.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He put down the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is the attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five cars.
Japanese live in rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of man’s computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you think you couldn't?
We were going back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe it?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars show up at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's ticking his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I'm not talking about the calf at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you want?
Mary laughed at her tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it in time.
It's seven thirty.
I see you woke up.
I want to know who said that to Tom.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually climb up the stairs through one.
Tom's been out for another year.
I'm near the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
Today, I've got everything going on.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom's only 30 years old to drive.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like this for a long time.
The cooking knife was not sharp enough to cut meat, so I used my feathered knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You're about to adjust to village life.
Hold a bucket of water next to it.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We've done everything.
The river is deeper here.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written in a transparent manner is a major problem in the Norwegian language.
What are you doing with the remains of the rice you have prepared?
She's been dead for ten years.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left shortly after that.
That book is worth reading.
Tom and Mary took classes before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife is not a sappong — you won't throw it off your leg.
I'll pick you up at six.
That's why I teach French.
I love teaching other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give that a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom lied.
He's selling cars.
You're still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope he doesn't."
Tom wasn't expecting Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I was eating yolk.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to make sure we check.
Tom gave Mary the gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get on the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
Here must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take his leave.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you how long it was to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits the same place twice.
I don't brag.
Leave it to me later.
Tom told Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make your own decision.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree we cut and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom to never write my daughter again.
The rabbits are multiplying fast.
I don't want to discuss it now.
How much will the coat be clean?
We'll steal it.
Get away from me.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When you're lucky to knock yourself into your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll be there anyway.
You don't mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I didn't know.
I couldn't help them.

How long did Tom die?
Are you playing guitar?
We hope we won't have to do this.
The situation is under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
This is obviously inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.

Don't let kids play around the pond.
Tom won't do it until you ask him.
Tom never helps me with my homework.
Tom's the usual boy.
I don't know exactly when Tom's coming.
Stop biting me.
What Tom did can't be changed.
You'll tell me later, right?
There's no fox here.
All right, let's go.
We have a meeting with the director.
You're gonna have to do it even if you don't want to.
Who here can't do this?
It's time to teach German.
How long have you and Tom been on the skis?
You don't like your name?
That's what Tom's afraid of most.
Tell him he shouldn't do this.
No one can do this job better than Tom.
There's someone in your room.
Let's talk about it now!
I hate advertising.
Do you have nightmares again?
I recommend you go on the bus.
You shouldn't do that without permission.
You just need to wait.
Are you really scared?
Tom didn't look sad at all.
Did you understand anything Tom said?
We're not gonna do this anymore.
Fresh mushrooms are so delicious.
You're still too young.
Maybe Tom knew what to do.
We almost never get started on time.
I'm pretty sure this will happen.
Our hotel window goes to the ocean.

We wouldn't be surprised.
Look if Tom doesn't run away.
You said to him what you think?
I've been drinking tea without sugar because I want to lose weight.
I'm ready, and you?
The deep ocean layers are still almost unexplored.
In an hour, we'll all sleep.
Before we get in, we need to get in.
There's no such place.
Do all the birds have bullets?
Do it already.
Maybe that's exactly what we all should do.
Have you seen Tom since?
I read the newspaper sometimes.
Why are you living with Tom?
After all, I decided not to offer myself this job.
He likes to go to parties.
How long have you been on the skis?
You'll never wake me up again.
Did Tom tell you that?
We all love you very much.
According to experts, this is unlikely to happen.
I never said she stole my money.
You can take my car when you want.
He can't be trusted with anything.
If she knew his phone number, she could call him.
Tom helped me put up cows.
He teaches me Dutch.
You think that's right?
Does anyone visit her?
Who did you just call?
Tom's not a good name for a magician.
I'm really sad about that.
No one in his right mind would have done that.
My son's too thin.
Most of it's true.
You'll call Tom and tell him.
I think I've never seen them before.
Don't let him eat or drink.
Who said I was here?
Did you drive somewhere last night?
Our wedding will be next Monday.
Grandpa Tom was serving in Vermacht.
You said it was a joke.

I need a knife to drown.
Yes, thank you.
Who's younger than us?
It's not like coffee today.
Tom likes to speak frankly.
That's a very few people who know.
You and I both know what Tom really wants.
You know everyone here, don't you?
I had no idea he was your husband.
Tom couldn't hide his anger.
I'm teaching him Dutch.
Those bums are very warm.
What don't you like in winter?
Are you really local?
Now all we need is volunteers.
I didn't promise you that.
Do you know why Tom didn't come today?
The first thing you need to do is contact Tom.
We need to reduce our monthly costs.
I got up late and missed breakfast.
Who opened the windows?
I love dogs and cats.
But it's good.

Would you like some coffee or some tea for breakfast?

You don't need to know everything.
She'll be ready right now.
Tom was hoping he wouldn't have to go to the hospital to see Christmas.

Has anyone seen Tom today?
In your position, I'd help Tom.
I've already noticed that.
Which of the boys is the most able?
I didn't see my ex-wife after our divorce.
It was by love that I wanted to marry her.
Can coffee hurt your head?
Tom and I were once friends.
I'd like to know what his name is.
It's not my daughter.
I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.
Ask someone else.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I thought you'd tell Tom to do it.
Tom's waiting for you there.
I hope you understand.
I would have done the same in your place.
Tom slept till noon.
At some point Tom has to leave.
Where's the cemetery?
Why do I make silly mistakes all the time?
Even the experts were wrong.
You want the same thing?
We need to be prepared for what may happen.
I want everybody to be jealous of me.
Tom said he wanted to stay in bed.
Tom's gonna go as soon as he's got a meal.
I'll help you, I won't.
I'd ask him at your place.
I like you a lot more than I used to.
Who pushed you?
Can I count on you today?

I'll be here in three hours.
Are you older or younger?
Did you ride a bike yesterday?
An adult has both eyes on one side of the person.
No one's behind me, I'm the last one.

So what did you do?
Confidentiality is important to us.
It's good you didn't go.
You could have been seen.
Get them if you can.
Tom said when he came back?
Go ask Tom what he wants.

Did you tell everyone I'm here?

Tom's still uninvited.
I don't believe you didn't see Tom there.
You're gonna need our help.
