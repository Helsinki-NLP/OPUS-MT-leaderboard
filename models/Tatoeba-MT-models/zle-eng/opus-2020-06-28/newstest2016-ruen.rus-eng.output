The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan region is recognized by electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the continuation of the travel benefits in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, arrangements have been made for the organization of preferential travel by citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan State.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Federation in the Ivan region, with regard to the change, provides for the maintenance of travel benefits in public passenger transport and aligns the social map with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the FZ on the national payment system.
At the same time, the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan region is recognized by electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application have changed.
For example, the replenishment limit is now established, not on travel as before, but on money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods, not more than 400 roubles in winter, and not more than 800 roubles in summer for the current month.
Members of social maps on transportation receipts will now need to monitor, not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of money.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens would be 1/2 the fee applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is subject to the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from 24 days of the previous month to 23 days of the current month.
A new arrangement for social travel will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of social map expenditure with accuracy of the copiers.
In addition, it is possible to recover the amount of money seized but unexpended.
We also add that the pattern of interaccounts with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is paid to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when a cash card is made.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Chief, Department of Road and Transport, Ivanovian, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million social-plan trips were undertaken in the region, and nearly 25 million trips in 2015.
The regional budget provides for the provision of concessional travel of citizens using a social map of over 470 million roubles.
As at 1 September, reimbursements to this end amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During the 911 call, a teacher is admitted to killing a friend
During the 911 phone call, the teacher of the Vuza Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that there was a need for staff to come home.
The Lamb stressed that there was a "saw" in the house that lived, but it was probably upset, and he said that the contact of the family of the deceased could be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentisss' body and a note that was carelessly written on the white sheet of the line paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to get it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that the Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at the Delta University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had succeeded in going 300 miles to a university campaign where the police believed he had shot down all respected author of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the threshold of his office.
The University of Delta Linne Badford police chief reported that the university staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more thing: Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after shooting at a school facility forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to make one picture of the motivation behind the Lamb.
The information shared by investigators in both ends of the state, as well as by the students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gothia, where Prentis was killed, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in which he expressed his appreciation for the “pretty people” with whom he crossed his teaching life.
Both taught at the School of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems to arise.
One student who made good comments about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the school year 2014-15, Lamb had told him how he was struggling with stress.
In the past, Lamb had asked the Delta University to grant him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes to university employment regulations meant that the doctor's degree to which Lamb was working would not automatically guarantee him the appointment of a teacher.
The president of the University, William Laforge, said that he had nothing to do with the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked the track of Lamba after he escaped from the company when he went back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before they could arrest him, Lamb shot 38 calibres in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to Washington Mathel Johnson, a coroner.
His engine car was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to the house, although, according to Johnson, she felt that he knew the people who lived there.
The Lamb grew up in those lands.
The Lamb began to work at a university of 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 2,000, in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He received a doctorate in the teaching sciences in the spring of the same year.
One ancient friend, Lamb, described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful person.
Carla Heirston told her that she was 15 years old and that Lambu was 20 years old when they first met each other.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a great guy older, who for several years had been trying to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he had enjoyed a success with women.
All the girls were there when he was there," says Heirston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
The Lamb and Prentiss have probably met for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lighting who lived with them in Gothia in a chiropy house, whose backside goes to the canal.
According to the police, it's okay with the dog.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stint, said they divorced 15 years ago, but were friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," said O'Stint about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter, Abigail, that Lab was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both spoke at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stine told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, barman and co-facilitator of entertainment programs in the tusk of the Enlightened Bar The Julep Rom in the suburb of Gothia, said that the last time he saw the Lamb and Prentis on the evening of 5 September, when the Lamb finished playing the guitar and the lipstick for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had a lot of fun and joked over each other.
I mean, they're both very acute.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for the first-hand students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, a English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emports, and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta University Company in Cleveland on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in the candle-creating memorial service.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university chorus was singing the Bright Morning Star and the Amazing Grey.
The occupation will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis's over.
It's a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that Lamba had joined 911 after the murder of Shamidt, as well as the fact that, while Lamb was talking about Prentis as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Uss plans to hire fewer employees for a holiday season
Toys R Uss states that it will not employ as many staff for a holiday as it was last year, with a lifeguard for toyers and children ' s goods indicating that it will provide staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale markets throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although there are months before holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient sales and sales, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "seems" with Princess Diane
The "Back to the Future" film was a big event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for the royal family to come, and I noticed that the place was right next to me, and I was going to be alone -- sitting next to me, Princess Diane -- he told the trailer, by the time he was on the screen with a documentary film, "Back in Time."
A film begins, and here I come to think that I'm literally at a distance of my arm, and in one false section of my visit to Princess Wales.
Back in time, a documentary film about "Back to the Future" includes interviews with Foxe, Lii Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as film director Robert Earthis and executive producer Steve Spillberg.
The next 30 years of "Back to the Future" was the premier film.
"To me," Spielberg says, "it is undoubtedly the greatest ever film ever filmed."
Back in time will be available on the VOD, DVD and in some movie theaters in October.
Head of UN states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states in response to the provision by Russia of military support to Syria, that for a nearly five-year conflict there is no “war solution” and an increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the UN again called on all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council, China, France, Russia and the United States, during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council’s differences, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation inexcusable”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they showed in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey results showing Donald Trump is not joking
Some have tried to put a label of a trigger on him.
Others flocked to him, perceived him as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to break Donald Trump’s high position in the results of the interviews, they have failed.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two significant figures, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means for the real estate magnet in terms of the chance to obtain a mine.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance to register the Republican party.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave up her popularity with Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the process of mine clearance.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeba Bush's Political Actuation, and the economic conservative group of the Growth Club, recognize the unbridled power of the Trump and begin to deliver their dollars in order to overthrow it.
Here are some figures that suggest that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The Trump sympathisms were set at 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump anonymously introduced his candidateship in mid-June, a poll at the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate magnet.
By mid-July it was 40 per cent.
It was 52 per cent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have negative opinions.
All of these figures are at the top in the early stages.
A survey of Quinipiac in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans there are committed to Trump.
Two thirds of the members of the GOP would be the candidate for the Trump.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either "surpassing" or "satisfied" if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "made" if he became a candidate.
Ben Carson alone generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd respond with a “miracle” versus 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next level of wonder?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they're not going to be satisfied with or designed if they say Jeb Bush's identity is going to become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's a problem.
While Trampa is highly criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of voters across the country think that the magnet has a suitable speed to be president, as revealed by the ABC News/Washington Post survey on Monday.
The same figure appears in the first closed congregation in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the same person who can be the chief commander, according to Quinapiac last week.
However, 44 per cent thought that he was not the person who could be effective in office, and nearly six of the 10 independent voters said that his speed was not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Past.
Republican voters are used to this idea.
When they put their pickup hats on the scooters, the Republican voters think that Trump is serious.
To the question of who was the most likely winner of the GOP mine, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten put a Jeba Bush on the end of July.
Full disclosure: Voter GOP did not have a correct magical crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate, Mitt.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Even if Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts suggest that this spread is likely to have an advantage of Trump, and that at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed to more than a dozen other candidates who support it.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that Trump is almost always supported by a majority in his hypothetical competition for “one by one” between Trump and most other Republican candidates.
He's ahead of Karli Fiorun on 13 points, Marco Rubio on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeba Bush on 19 points, and finally Randa Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christy on 33 points.
He's got someone with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who goes around?
Ben Carson chased a 19-point businessman in a hypothetical competition called "one by One."
Just over half Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the people who support the Trump say they are confident of their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most intense competition at Trump at the moment is with our outsider neuroscraper Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their mind are probably going to pick Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump named Mexico's immigrants “violent” two months ago in his campaign, the subject of immigration became the most relevant subject of conversation in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will divert key Latin American voters from the Republican party and prevent the rebranding.
But according to ABC/Past survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Tramp on immigration.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it appears that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of approximately half of the voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll state that they are more likely to want a political outsider than a man with experience in government.
And they're also hurt in Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent of the “unauded” and 21 per cent of the“extension”.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indices in October.
The Vice-President of the Russian Federation, Olga Holotec, stated that the Government is now looking for options for the implementation of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to real inflation.
She noted that the solution should be found by 8 October at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the cabinium discusses the option of laying down a decision to freeze a accumulated parent's pension.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
About as much as the full pension index is worth the next year.
According to the Vice-President, there is not yet a final decision on the question of who should pay the contributions of non-working citizens.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays him.
Previously, the media reported that there were two options to balance the government in the cabin.
Why is it often annoying and effluent?
responds to phythalmologist Tatian Levisov:
Our veins are the broads protecting the eyeball from the many small particles that sit on them.
Having forgotten the regular cleansing of the century, we are often the very means of developing blufararians.
Simple exit:
Don't keep your eyes dirty with your hands, wearing a special wet salphite for a century;
within a period of between 1 and 2 times a day, cleanse a century of the harmful substances stored in them.
Cleaning procedures need to be complemented by warm pressure with pots of curable grass (salfea, Roma) that are fueling the thick secret of the salinity glands and then by the massages of a century, which should be conducted by circular movements of finger cushions;
Wear the makeup, do not use the alcohol - controlled tools.
They dry and dehydrate the skin, and they help to further satisfy the secret of the salinity glands.
Phenyan claims that the Korean brokers created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yonben nuclear complex, works “at full power”.
This was reported on the site of the Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is prepared at any time to respond to “the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by quantity and quality”.
The latest test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans for the re-launching of the reactor since then have not been reported.
Pynyang claims he managed to create a nuclear warhead.
Also, the DPRK has carried out tests of medium- and low-range missiles, which are polit.ru.
Jirinsky demanded that the mention of the brotherly peoples be removed from Russian homing.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zyrinsky believes that a reference to the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national gymn.
He spoke about this during the meeting of Gosduma, reports "Rust News Service".
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long gymmon, the longest in the world, even athletes don't stand it," said Zirinsky.
The deputate believes that it is necessary to remove all the four who contain the building:
In the summer of 2014, Zyrinsky stated that the present gym must be changed to "God, the King Save" and the Russian tricolon would be replaced by an imperial flag, writing polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Asad of Syria called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to address the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans worry about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to engage in dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible for people to die while they continue to bleed and until people feel safe.
“In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot do anything until we have won terrorism in Syria,” said Asad.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, had arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of extremist fighters from the Islamic State may be among the migrants who come to Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation in order to establish their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
German city residents have set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a leader in hosting refugees, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain them.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will be arriving in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts refer to significant numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country since early September.
B.B.B.A., Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, a town where migrants received a warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister's session
After the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut is expected to be very much anticipated by the Prime Minister at the session.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will shortly address the Prime Minister for the first time in his efforts with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised during the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Leiborist Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” on the weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will take place after he has been appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of the Tred Juniors on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Liberian leader to remain silent during the execution of the national championship on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of Beatva for Britain, provoked criticism on the part of a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a state gmina has attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's Prime Secretary stated that he was “seriously silent” and acknowledged the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in Betwe for Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin Oyen Smith, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, told Newsny on BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the labourists to sing the national gmn “independent” from his conviction of the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to join Mr. Corbin ' s team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “scooped up” in the party of liberalists following the appointment of Mr. Corbin as a member of the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tred Union Conference that the Leiborist Party had amended to abolish the very idea of limitations in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pension, stated that the party had “full clarity” on the fact that it was in opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the labourists with whom David Cameron will meet in the Pier's box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the labourists, who promised a different approach to politics, said that he had “encouraged collective resources” in order to get the ideas of Mr. Cameron's questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Eileington North stated that the questions of the Prime Minister were too confrontational and that he would refrain from ecstatic responses and the exchange of colloquies, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Igle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on Prime Minister matters when he was absent, such as when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also suggested allowing other colleagues to take the floor when possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Community of John Burkow to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the “darkant balgan” often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had not succeeded.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the affairs of the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has turned into a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Scienced in Johannesburg" by homeless young people who were trained in photographs
Johannesburg Business Centre is a complex place for homeless people.
But one group of former streetmen found a way to master a trade and earn a living.
"I was taken away in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of their surroundings and earn money for that.
BBC News met with one of the first students of the project.

Pound2 growing as wages grow in Britain
The foundation was raised against the rise in wages in Britain, and the FTSE index rose by the proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings less bonuss increased by 2.9 per cent, compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate has been highest since 2009, and it has been seen as a shift to early projections of possible boilers.
It had increased by more than 1 per cent in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro by €1,3730.
FTSE 100 index grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
The general background was the SABMiller shares, which grew by 20 per cent as a result of a purchase proposal from AB InBev.
A transaction would bring together the two largest beer companies in the world, collecting brands such as Budwiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Berberry shares have grown by 0.9 per cent against encouraging news from the competitive group of producers of the class of Richemont.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that Chinese sales -- in the key market for Burundi -- started to grow again.
Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant announced that it was able to obtain $2.5 billion by placing shares as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging groups were leaders of the index's fall of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced the rating of the group before selling.
The JDports shares have grown since the sports suit company reported an 83 per cent increase in income to six months ' income to £46.6 million.
Chief JDports says that higher wages can hinder expansion
The Executive Director of JD Reports Peter Kaugill said that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it's unlikely that such purchasing power would outweigh the cost of labour, he says.
The cost could have an impact on the JD Reports expansion plans, he added, which could have meant a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metsash launch a campaign at the bottom of the campaign to fight Aldi
Metsash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier initiated a campaign to protect the IGA share market in South Australia and Western Australia at the bottom of the initiative, in light of the impending influence of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the following year, the Metsash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and advance the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media networks and at activities like the Adlaide Show.
Reuters and IGA suppliers, such as the Dinsboro Ice Shimmo's producer, who offers degustation in IGA shops, and shop owners selling discount tickets to regular clients at the South Australian soccer League.
Metsash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, a day when the wholesale food, alcohol and business provider will pursue its annual investor policy.
Much has been put on board since South Australia and Western Australia have almost 30% of all Metsash shops, showing higher profitability than the Metsash IGA network in the eastern states.
South and Western Australia’s buyers are known as those who are committed to the common routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA miners than to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland — more than 30 per cent in USA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan State, believe that Aldi will cut off 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first shops, taking away sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent food dealers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan State, believes that IGA's miners can lose $160 million per year in sales and Metsash can cost $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets, respectively.
The loss of income and sales of food at a high constant cost of Metcash may cost companies about 13 million income before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat considers.
At the same time, Metsash loses its share in the market in the Eastern States, mainly because of Aldi and Colles, and this, while a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan State, the sales of Metsash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Chief Stock Manager Hemish Douglas, founder of Mahella Financial Group, noticed a business lunch in Melbourne that Metsash " could be very likely to disappear for a decade.
Metsash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metsash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA ' s share in the market declined from 18 to 14 per cent in 2010 and Metsash ' s income from the food business that the company supplies to about 1,200 IGA retellers fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of the operational doverage and due to pressures on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not manage to spend more than $150 million annually to balance retail prices with prices in the Colles and Volworths for thousands of items per week, and to help IGA's rescuers recycle trading sites, as well as to offer a rapidly expanding range of fresh food products and a wider range of branded foods.
The Director-General of Metsash, Ian Morris, said that price balances and trade improvements were gaining momentum, and he hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanassi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hili
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanassi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kirios and for his conduct, he deserved more than the criticisms put it to him, as President Tennis of Australia, Steve Hili.
Kokkinakis, who is a talented duet and is often called "Special Ks", has been unintelligible because of the shameful overcrowding of Kiryos with Stan Vavrinka on the Monttreal Masters Tour.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualification match in the Cincintate, a judge on a platter had to do two rounds of Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Vavrinka had to put it on Kirios' blades, and I had to put it on that guy's blades."
As long as Kokkinakis last saw a flashing rocket in his leg, saving Richard Gaske from a possible injury to US Open, Hill has loyally protected Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth to be the second person after Bernard Tomicha, in a single level, at the Kubka Davis v. Great Britain.
"I'm really worried about one thing, that's what Tanasy got into the conflict," said Hili.
He's really broken a rocket when he's got his foot on US Open, but he's not the first player who's been hit by a rocket when hope goes down, and I know Tanassi enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he's been doing very well in a fairly provocative situation in US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a nice family, and I just think he's a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's been working hard, he's got a great team, he's never had trouble with other players, he's respected outside his court, he's trained, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and mature young man, and I think he should be valued.
Hili also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for the important game that began on Friday, putting the “community” as the right way for everyone, but considering that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"We all want the team to concentrate on the match, not the disputes around [Cyrius]," said Hili.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, which is proved by people like Federer and Marrey, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticisms he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
There were riots on the border, hundreds of migrants digging in the border area, and the Serbian authorities responded severely.
After an uncertain period of time between the checkpoints of the two countries, people who had fled from armed violence in their homeland had broken tents and settled in that area.
However, frustration had come to pass.
When a police helicopter was walking over them, migrants shouted to the Hungarian Special Purpose Police to “open the border” and shouted insults to the Hungarian Police.
Some turned down food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared the expulsion of migrants “unacceptable” from Hungary as they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of a solution to the problem, not associated damage.
There is a need to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days” stated in Prague, Ivica Dachić.
The Waldenses on the Hungarian-Serb border began the following day after a group of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to have a shared responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in crowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that in the future (a further month or by the end of the year) an agreement would be reached that European Union member States would welcome another 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded the convening of an emergency summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis that affected the continent next week.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The Tuesday emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, enabling them to close roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Hungary, Peter Cylarto, stated that his country was also planning to erect a fence from a barbed wire on the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had finished the debt on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been involved in the urgent work of completing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “separate” and border crossing point of the European Union for resettlement, many of which are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and countries in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that the majority of people who come into the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, victims of hostilities that are entitled to protection, and that view differs sharply from that of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws which entered into force in Hungary at midnight are now considered to be a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) barrier from a barbed wire constructed by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison periods for those accused of trafficking in persons.
“In view of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency”, said a representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We clearly understand that illegal border crossing is a crime.
The Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, expected next week, but reporters of Associated Press, who are on the border, have observed the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Djrej Bacondi, Adviser to Orban on National Security, reported on the capture by authorized authorities of 45 persons trying to cross the border on the border itself and 15 others on the domestic level.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, were currently in police custody and were charged with administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passageways on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, blocking one of the passageways of a railway wagon with a barbed wire.
The riots broke out on the main passage through the border near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed office space to pass people inside a metal container, and people's crowds pushed each other inside.
Some 20 persons were made inside, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced denial of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: The benefits of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders have been reduced by half in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a two-digit advantage in a democracy race for mine-freeing throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders reaches it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democrats (down 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the first election competition, the majority of democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have identified the candidate to be supported.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than in supporting other candidates.
Since the survey of CBS News last month, Clinton has lost some demographic groups and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage to women and the moderate, but that's a good advantage.
Her support for men has fallen considerably, and Sandras has only five points behind her.
The preference given by Clinton to democratic voters for up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage for the older voters.
In the past month, Clinton has been around Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of five points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democrats throughout the country say that they would be enthusiasticly supportive of Clinton if it were to become a candidate from the party.
Four would support it with some reservations, while another 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to show more enthusiasm for her account.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, her views are more contradictory - only about a quarter of her enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of the primary democrats say that they would be enthusiasticly supportive of Clinton, a smaller number of voters speak of their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters ask an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the time is now for a woman president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton’s supporters also speak of an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It's also called an agreement on issues and the chances of election.
Since the Vice-President was considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters wished him to join the race - although one third felt he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among party candidates, the primary democratic voters are in most cases called Baiden.
There's more than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd choose Biden the second one than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to stand out for the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will be increased from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points of race without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Bijden, with a high backlog in the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that it is most important for the candidate, democratic voters choose other options than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates for democracies or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, showed good results on some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy men of good leadership.
Baiden of all three is honest, and Clinton's strong side is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democrats do not consider Clinton to be fair and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion of him.
The prime democratic voters are also generally considered to be similar to the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about the personal e-mail drawer and the server at Hillary Clinton ' s Home Secretary continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their common view of it.
But that's a completely different story for the American public at large.
Half the Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has had no effect on their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, over six of every 10, who claim that their opinion about Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 times as compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not regard it as honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not view Trump as honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six protesters, Baiden, Carson, and Bush show the best results of honesty.
Most people see an honest man in Sanders rather than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The number of errors for sample of 351 primary democrats is 6 percentage points.
In a national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in his latest survey of CBS/New York Times
Two of these candidates won half of the vote in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of foot support.
Recycling voters throughout the country continue to support the Trump massively, with a 23 per cent increase in support from a recent CBS survey conducted on the eve of a debate on Fox News last month, to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups by harassing Trump in a popular voter group with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio, John Kasic, went back with Governor Viskinsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor Florida Jab Bush, former Governor Arkansas Mike Hakabi and senator of Florida Marco Rubio, together, hold a third seat, with 6%.
The sample error rate of 376 voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 per cent, which was conducted in September.
A recent survey of CNN/ORC, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in surveys -- showing support to 19 per cent among Republicans -- for Trump with 32 per cent of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is far ahead of Carson.
With the increased support of Carson last week, Trump made a number of critical attacks on the former neurosurge, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Tramp's faith.
"We need energy," said Tromp on last Saturday at the close of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of the Baruch College’s first teacher.
About two years after the death of a college student, five people were charged with murder during a ritual ceremony dedicated to a brotherhood in the Pozno Mountains in Pennsylvania.
"Plite Delta Psy of the New York College Baruch cruelly attacked Chan Mayk during his dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him to hospital on time, causing his death," reported the police.
Officials say that a student with fixed eyes and a 30-pound backpack with a sand behind his back has been pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking across a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pí Delta Psy's brothers didn't call 911 when Deng fainted, and they waited for another hour before they took him to the hospital, they're talking to the police.
They have, however, taken the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in the corner, and contact Andy Mengo, National Brotherhood President, to ask the council how the Chief of Police, Chris Wagner, told the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began hiding personal property, essentially by putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Denga's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the opening report, Deng suffered a number of blunt head, body and thigh injuries.
"In the past, many families have been affected by rituals of brotherhood, as at least one student dies every year, from 1970," said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step is very important on the part of the authorities.
Monroe jurymen have been in favour of the third degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against newcomers and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this formally or informally, both,” said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There's going to be a rise in rates, and the bull market is going to collapse, bond returns will go up, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know, that's how long it's been before it's coming, and how long it's gonna last.
For the economy, history has little to say about time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first rate increase and for 86 months.
The delicateness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank Administration therefore insists so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest, but on how much adaptation they will take.
Actually, play a lot of variables.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole cycle of rates increases is exaggerated.
“The first rise in the Federal Reserve with the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the “cost money” era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal rate, but still low levels will be the seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could respond, depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the last month or so, waiting for rates may lead to instability for some time.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not such a dramatic one.
"It doesn't seem like the stock revenue is slowed by 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said the analysts Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the Federal Reserve increase.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - upwards of the rates, remains fairly equal within 250 days (the average growth of 2.6 per cent), then reverts to the average rate of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent Bob Doll analysis, the chief actor trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche, it is said that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced at the rate increase immediately, and the revenue from shares is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but price increases often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that were not previously present and can accelerate the recession.
The bulk of the gross domestic product will be located at almost the lowest point during the lifetime of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 rates of increase since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it would be long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Higher rates on such an unstable economic background may be risky and ask “Will this be different”, reported Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the rates of the Federal Reserve System all year round, with their views attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many policy and economists believe that FOMC could approve increases in rates at this meeting, future trade only indicates a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the rate increases to date have been in the super-cycle of increasing financial flows to GDP, covering the peaks leading to recession very quickly after the start of recovery," states the report.
In contrast, this was a very slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle for the moment is the longer one that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, all for 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for a rise in rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being done for shares.
The principle difference is that bond effect comes faster than equity when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yield would appear to change the vector immediately after the first increase/precipitation in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond return rates are falling immediately," says Deutsche.
The Challes Schwab strategy specialists believe that a rise in rates would result in long-term and short-term bonds coming closer to the curve more flat.
High income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of income fluctuations," says a study by Cathy Jones, a fixed income analyst in Schwb.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of Federal policy.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the falling of inflation expectations, there are indications that the market has adapted to the vision of a tighter monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates for short-term loans rose, the revenue curve was more flat, the credit prosthetics increased, the volatility increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the policy of the Federal System.
In general, companies leading their major business in the United States will benefit from interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be worse because the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt is more expensive in financial terms.
"The story shows that the "quality" shares demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial increase in rates," said the Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Sustainable financial companies have been bypassed by unstable companies as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Capital high-income companies, as well as low-voltal shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average 4 (per cent points) and 3 (per cent points), respectively.
I'd have to ask you a big question.
High-percent floating-rate companies lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to net exchanges, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could see profits also because of higher profitability, although experts differ as to how fast this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of the Classic FM", claims a member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham unveiled the station for the “debt of standards”
Proclaims that it is becoming less different from commercial competitors.
Also targeted at BBC Music Awards, saying the prize's just funny with British
Damien Collins Parliament Colleges, which came across The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 becomes a Classic FM," said the leader of the Parliament, urging the television company to prove that it does anything that commercial companies don't do.
A member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham also stated to the BBC leadership that it seems as if the public radio station "guppet" is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems like -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but I think it turns into a classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Award, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, looks like the British under a different title.
So, if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that are the first to come to my mind, in which you're actually copying what's already on the market,' said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of his commercial rival when it came to living music and public education.
What I'm learning with Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to living speeches and the creation of music does not really compare with anyone else.
"So it's really important, I think, to Rado 3's interest in finding new music and moving new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Manager Radio 3 stated that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because British people were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent music show that BBC bought at the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feit and Boy George participate as judges, was done in "the typical BBC style."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find it in her own home stable next time she started a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the commission of new seasons The Voice in the future or to use the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment.
The growth of Internet sales was as slow as possible in August, and could be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales of seven per cent
Last month's slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile devices for walking
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help contain the costs
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been experiencing booms, turning many central streets into a ghost town in Britain.
But experts say there are now signs of an equalization of online sales, after the latest figures showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online stopping in August showed a minimum increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of an equalization of online sales after the latest figures showed only a seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the rate of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian Andy Malkehi, the sales index editor of IGRG.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to purchase.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see the drop.
The Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing of sales.
Experts believe that buyers may have refrained from buying on the eve of the event that took place in the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers five times the average speeded up to computers to benefit from the offers, thereby disrupting a number of seller's websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter into the real fight for profitable purchases, could force people to stop walking.
According to a study published by the British Republic Consultium, just over £1 of every 5 is online.
With regard to products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet companies.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothing and footwear more willingly than they do in fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims have been buried in the fall of the tap in Mecca and sanctions have been imposed on Ben Laden's family
Muslims spend the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia was partly responsible for the accident of the Saudi Binladin Group construction giant
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the collapse of the tap
Hundreds of Muslims from all over flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed as a result of the collapse of the tap on the Main Mosque of Mexico.
Mostly dressed in white, attending funerals filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went to the Al-Moissem cemetery.
The process was past a sacred site, where a building tap had struck the ceilings of a mosque and fell on an alien just a few days earlier.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time King Saudits fined a construction company belonging to Ben Laden ' s family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The body of 29 foreigners killed in a tap in the main mosque carrying in the streets
Among the victims was Kasim Akram's father, a four-year-old boy from Bolton, the Big Manchester, who was on his first pilgrim trip when the faggot fell.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladen Group should not have left an arrow tap up at a non-working tap.
An Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency states that Binladen Group is partly responsible for the breach.
The English version of the news agency did not provide this details, but reported that the company's leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman had promised to find out why the tap had gone to the palace of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had fled to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the tap crash, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of failing to implement modern security measures and inadequately aligning with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of taps surround the Main Mosque of Mexico, as part of extensive construction that leads to Binladen Group.
The Ben Laden family has been among the immediate ruling families of Saudi Arabia for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son of a different age from whom the family refused in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials had decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount would have been irreversible.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European handicrafts working for small money.

Britishs are said to lay back their hammers and malarian whales and instead hire skilled East Europeans to do housework
If you know how to handle a hammer or how to steal walls, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because, according to owner B&Q, British people are increasingly hiring master workers to do a simple housework.
Veronika Laurie, new director-general of the Kingfisher, who owns a network of home improvement services, reported that this trend is followed by a substantial flow of skilled workers from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 Screwfix stores specializing in workshop products, while closing down 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shops, since eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by low-sex representatives.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, characterized by an increasing number of single-woman households, were more concerned with housing management than in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "Our shops are still dominated by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods are taken by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women driving the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is just not the only company where 50 per cent of the managers are women, including the General and Financial Director.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious solution, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women at the board of directors.
After the group incurred the costs of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this Kingfisher trend, owned by Sprewfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Decision time at the US Federal Reserve rate
The world has observed the Federal Reserve Bank ' s meetings, during which a crucial decision is discussed for two days, whether to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the past decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who, last week, thought that the Federal Reserve would do so, now believe that it would be still in harming and keeping the current range rate 0-25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we agree that the main bank can move with zero points and start the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubid, lead official of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy works effectively, economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but that they were convinced that all the odds were against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20 p.m. on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees are going to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" --survey hundreds of refugees at the Khorgosch crossing on the Serbian-Wanger border.
Since Tuesday Budapest has closed the border for the displaced.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to Europe.
One of them is across Romania along the closed border with Serbia.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, is in Austria.
According to some data, buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebosha Stenavić, assures him that his country is doing its utmost to help refugees, but that its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to ensure that Serbia is as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
To resolve it is difficult, no country in Europe can do it alone, and even so small a country such as Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Victor Orban does not bow:
If a refugee is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't let it go to our country either, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already constructed a 175-inch fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this; he plans to place the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
The Gospel of Maymarakis, "Europe wants to help us."
The Gospel of Maymarakis had been a member of the legalist governments for several years, which, in the view of the left-wing, had led to a financial crisis.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he is challenging the Tspas.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist in Euronus.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Europe!
The Gospel of Maymarakis: I thank you for the invitation.
Nine months ago, your party was defeated by the SIRI course, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy was at the same time as it was popular.
What's changed during that time?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tippes lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a fiscal deficit and a high rate of unemployment.
Investors left because Mr. Tippas had missed them.
During the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
The daily life has been markedly worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win elections, you're going to work for alliances with other parties, including SIRISM.
The Gospel of Maymarakis: The point is, as we've understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all right-wing parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronus: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tippas and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new primer on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece on the European road because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences of the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, and we have solidarity funds, a Junker package, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current measures of hard economy have been the result of Mr. Tiraps ' negotiation.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to bring order in the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the fact that the recessions have led to negotiation, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of operation of the new agreement we would be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they are awaiting full implementation of the agreement.
If we want their confidence back, we must continue to privatization, the reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Tspros Government has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that it was not about fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be taxed completely in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Tspras had never told us that.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were not well informed, so they failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Ms. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we had tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by bypassing its acute angles.
We have advanced reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and swiftness, but we acted under emergency circumstances.
The market had fallen, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was then a Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which made up a majority of the government at the time.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key drafts, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the massive demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the pre-trial general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronus: The last weeks of Greek territory have been running a massive flow of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and the response of the European countries that these people seek?
The Gospel of Maymarakis: Crisis with refugees is a slow action bomb that we have to deal with after winning elections.
The reason is that the Government of SIRIZA did not act in this situation as it should have been.
Such matters should be proactive, for if the problem ensnares you, only emergency measures remain.
And we are now in that situation.
Even the interim government that changed SIRIZA did more in only seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions by the interim Government, which is being provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the Syrian war, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that took place with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interviews.
Gospel of Maymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzkovka Donetsk province, on a day-to-day basis, members of the police department ' s criminal investigation office, together with military counter-solved, identified and detained a suspect who had been trained by a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivo Rog (Dnepropetro district), who had fired an automatic gun at his opponent on the eve of the day before night during the sharing of alcohol.
A 22-year-old boy was injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with a handgun wound.

The husband of the popular Russian actor Eugunia Tsaganov Irin Leonov gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl appeared at a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Remember, Ziganov and Léonov just broke up.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames his husband and his ambitions for everything.
Euguia Tsganov 36 years old.
He's an actor of the Moscow Theatre of the Master Petro Fomenko.
It's known for "Steeping" films, "Cosmos as Premonition," "Breast Stamps," and "Otepel" and "Farza".

The person who opened the shooting at the Delta University left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "satisfied" about the first murder and would like to "get it back" to the authorized authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gothia, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called at 911 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people home to him.
He said, "I killed my wife yesterday night," and he also mentioned that the house has a "saw" that "no one gets touched" but is probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
The Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
Upon arriving at the crime scene, the police discovered Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying: “I wish I could bring it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, was killed, and on Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, ended up with him.
The University Rector William Laforge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something on his mind."
Despite the information on Monday that the Lamb had included an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, on Tuesday official services reported that there was “no information or evidence” of a “love triangle”.
Prentiss was called "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who said he was married about seven years old.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stine told me he and Prentis have a daughter who's 19, and that she's "unsolved."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "better friends."
According to Lindsay Nouls, a newspaper called a close friend of Prentiss, the last one was working from home over the Internet.
Nouls told me Prentis had a hunting dog called Lighting and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, the Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same day that the police caught him on the highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, rushed out of it, fled into the woods and shot him.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate degree at the University of Delta in the field of teaching.
Deliverances Lost
Axter (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), lived a number of difficult years.
In 2001, he fought the leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his life as a companion of Farro Fosett, who died of cancer.
An actor was also reportedly drug-dependent and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United left for a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places at the Coach of the League of champions where Manchester United played the PSV in Windhoena.
While the defence counsel is concerned about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again during that season.
Travma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless ride for 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw entered the PSV fine zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double break, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later, and then taken over.
It's terrible that a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18 and faced great difficulties and began playing fantastically, and this is where it happened.
It had an oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy can't play the group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Morno was lucky he didn't get a red card and there was no plans.
Nicola Rizzoli's archer didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal believes that an Italian judge made a mistake.
Consider yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-foot ride.
In his Twitter, Shaw says, "Thanks everyone for your messages, saying don't describe how I'm devastated, my path to recovery starts, I'll come back even stronger than I was."
Still on the topic: Manchester United is in trouble with Luke Shaw in the PSV game
Anglican's attorney will have an additional incentive to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious trauma."
When any player gets hurt like this, it's really upset.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Morno moved his feet when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team, led by Van Gale, at the Peace Championship 2014.
"It's very difficult now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious trauma, it feels bad," said Coke.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in another direction, so it looked like it touched him, but I didn't see Luke riding.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to carry it.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smoling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lurks?
Every parent is very quick to think about one thing: If your child liked a book, it'll take some time before you get to know it almost by hand.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a child's rest company in the holidays about his favorite child's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax", an environmental story written by Dr. Susan in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and he wrote Cameron in a comment published on SuperCamps' website, and he goes on, "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a powerful message I love to read to my children, because it always detects some image or message that we're missing."
All right, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to rewind the contents of the book, but actually tells a story about a single movie that was filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to reflect a rather short, original story.
"In the high walls of the town of Nmnujville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, a girl of his dream, having fulfilled her desire to see this tree," we read a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suzu (the real name of Theodor Suz Heisel), who died in 1991.
If this seems unsettling, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of a movie in "Lorax" on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl's dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so ignorant of the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns of how a greedy tree feller and a prisoner of the “milk” Najqins, despite Lorax’s protests, is a funny creature with a mouth that “speaks on behalf of trees”.
It is likely that such a simple PR task was entrusted to the perpetrator who never read a book about Lorax 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly obtained from the office of Cameron in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been made.
For Adam Lita, there was clearly a risk of not getting into England's collection, but that's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the collection that England has selected for this tour, the recurrence of the 3-0 test series that happened last time does not seem likely to me.
Nor would I rule out victory in my field.
Alister Cook's team may have been less experienced than the one who was three years old, but it includes players who are virtualizing their handballs and collective thinking; they will not bring with them scars from 2012 but only young ones.
With Moen Ali's ball, it becomes a bowler that passes the stick balls, and Adyl Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for a test level, is an attacking option.
Still on the topic: Adam Leet left England's collecting room at a test cry and replaced by Alex Hayls
The decision to exclude Adam Lith from me, his chief trainer in Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyse.
His seven test match had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but harsh reality was that players were being judged by judges on the outcome.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, that led to this announcement, because (and I mentioned earlier) players chose themselves best.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could have been waiting for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds to Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The chief trainer in England, Trevor Baileys, made good comments about his mood, even when he didn't show me what he was capable of, and it didn't surprise me; he was first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take for the betasman of the test scream to leave the impression -- a difficult question.
It played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played at nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his field and on another person's own.
The only thing you could say is that England chose Jonathan Troth for the Caribbean Prime League when Little was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
This is Alex Hayles, and he's a betaman I value highly.
He's an unpredictable screamer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he earned 236 in a match against us at the Trent Bridge Square Square Square Square, which was something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it will of course depend on the composition of the team in the AEA.
The thought of placing Moena next to Cook as an open-ended betaman, which would allow for the introduction of an additional spinner, while keeping four short-term Bowlers, thinking, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see any reason why a beating player can't hit a ball there, and this lion has already shown that he's a bloody good screamer.
Manny may not be quite what is needed for her county of Woostershire, but became a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test games with a third betsman before he opened in 2001.
He won at once three hundred and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a reserve spinner, and at my brief conversation with him, he has proved to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his applied statistics -- on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among those who vote "for" a little, and who chose youth.
He's going to learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahéla Jaidoordin, a Sri Lankan betsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master's performance.
He's one of the best guys to play, and he's going to bring into it the wealthiest experience he's ever had, under all possible conditions and any attack.
Paul Collinswood is included in white ball games and will provide both a energy and a lifeless pace in the net.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international scream, be it play or coaching, and, like Mahela, has a small intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength to the team.
The Darem Ben Stokes College College is left behind for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I have no problem, for example.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, like players, their position depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easily adopted.
The British withdrawal camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's unthinked policy to resume negotiations on maintaining Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly complex every day, even without looking at the election of a genius Jeremy-"That's true?" -- Corbin's leader of laborists or the rejection of TUC on Tuesday for Europe.
Aliens also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The friendly European diplomat explained in the past that, in the current situation of the EU, with its various crises — not all of them in their own manufacture — some of the participating countries are in the throat of the British ecocentric pelvising and undermining agreement on changes they do not want most.
After meeting in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that he did not want them in any case, if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selphy.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance ride at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves on the background of a well-known local monument, to a company of local fame or without it, then come home and say they invite allies to reform.
That's all about me.
My European friend who wants to maintain Britain's external contacts under the influence of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the black-headed ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they're still going to, stay or leave.
Angel Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before the situation deteriorates as she deteriorated for the people who sit in Tatcher (11 years old), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16 years old).
France’s head, François Olland, stands in front of a reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon obtain the nationalist right-hand government, Spain, from the left-hand side.
It's hard to see them lying out of the skin to help those who have energy to prevent Scotland from getting out of Britain -- which they don't want, because most people have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers may even plan to distribute deliberately useless SNP rivers during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to support the British withdrawal process, my friend suggests.
“The revision was an idea-of-fix” and “Britnia has not received anything of value from the renewed negotiations”.
Europeans know in their plight what the Falit Street might be, and how the media magnets are skeptical about the EU, unlike Tony Benn referendum in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They can be sad to remember Boris Johnson, a European opportunist who was known for his “direct bananas” of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a sanding company from jockeys, telephone hackers and non-resident pseudo-residents who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion, but she was aware that when you're in a cell with a big throat, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not give her to eat you lunch and have another tea.
According to the fact, Milliband was more committed to Blaer than he himself to opposing Cameron's idea of referendum, since Blair gave in favour of the repealed EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But as Jeremy Corbin, who was friendly with me on his back in Westminster on Monday, I told him that he didn't have any more time to spend it on me -- looks like he'd risk repeating the Neil Kinick's "Broco Merdock" strategy in the 80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
It might take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press -- not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is something that I call delicately evolution.
He said he wanted us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside Ukip's traditionalist trend and a wider range of Little England's outsiders can probably say yes to that among the thoriums.
It's the same thing as Hillary-"Benn, but not bannit"-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his internal boycott refused to admit that the appointment of Corbin to bear John McDonnell as the "tentural" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father-in-law fought hard at TV for his non-loyality to colleagues in the Labour Office without going too far, without losing his position in the Cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in all circumstances" -- Benna's phrase -- not what McDonnell said, not what J.K. spoke to the mayors and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
So that we can't tell democracy, and that's Corbin -- remember, he touched even me -- that the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour television age for seven days a week, especially in the water gates of social networks, in the heat of paranoia and prejudice.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron get so easy to separate himself from Europe, allowing him to take as much support as he can during the referendum campaign as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But MacDonnell and Corbin's main fraud about membership in the EU - within the “bennitic” bonded economy - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion amongst the left dissidents, for which Narcissism, born of minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his error with regard to Nato - Tom Watson, it would not be hard for J.K. to campaign for withdrawal - foreign diplomats would have to try to get it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital -- they also had suspicious voters -- to the British concessions, when this could be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Tori has cut costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch lunch, at a forum called British Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government-funded agency that 95 per cent of the cigarettes were less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting of 12 persons, some of whom were associated with tobacco industry, were reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report -- last month's "backcast" -- called it "the comprehensive evidence review."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in the Lancet Medical Journal last month, the “extraordinary arguments” on which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two additional researchers asked whether these statements were based on “solid or exclusive grounds”.
Martin McCay, a professor of European health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “Fundamental principle of health - rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that “the best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco treatment” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria decision-making model in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with the various Nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McCey and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General was reported to have received funding from British American Globalco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly received from Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of Board members, but there were several well-known e-smokers, some of whom also claimed to finance the industry in a publication.
It was not known whether other participants had experience in tobacco management.
The tobacco head also visited the PHE.
A scientific article published by the group “is in agreement” that there is a lack of “wisdom proof of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCa and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were covered in the PHE report.
McCi and Capewell reported that PHE statements stating that “there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, reported that the BMJ statements had been answered earlier.
He said, "The cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die of smoking-related diseases and smoke costs NHSs 2 billion pounds a year.
By clearly pointing out that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only a part of the harm caused by smoking, we are performing our tasks to the nation.
Former chapter Channel 4 believes that BBC should end the Eastern Enders series
Former chap. Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing such programs as EastEanders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given a lot of money for such successful shows as soap operas about Albert's Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to establish programmes that are not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are likely only a small part of the audience, at a peak air time when competitors are having high ratings, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had been unsuccessfully engaged with BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
“I cannot separate myself from the thought that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting transfers that could show competing companies that do not receive grants”, he told Johnson to members of the House of Lords Communications Committee in order to ascertain the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I don't consider a good solution in the medium and long term, companies should leave only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
Shaw The Voice goes out in a prime book because the makers want to get the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: I don't understand why regressive taxes have to be funded from broadcasts that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEenders is another; it's known that they're their own production.
Other channels would certainly have given away much for it.
I don't understand how public broadcasting can be.
I don't think that would be a humiliation for BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of staff ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular BBC show are echoed with those of the Executive Director of Sky Tony Bola, who, in his McTaggart lecture in Edinburg in 2003, invited BBC to sell raw materials of type EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the more downward BBC transfers of a public "are continuing to go to BBC4 where there is often no way to evaluate the audience, but the company's function has been fulfilled, and this could be argued in the Ghanaian sermons to justify income from the licence fees of four billion pounds: "yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transfers that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licensing fee, Johnson told the Committee: “I encourage you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for the people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I'm wondering, because they don't think they're watching or listening to BBC.
The former executive director of the Sky and Channel 5 channels David Elsten, who also spoke to the committee on the previous Tuesday, said that the BBC was supposed to review the Rit's mission in favour of “inform, preaching and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC ' s currently produced material was formally classified as educational materials - he said it was a 1% television content and 0.1% radio - and that the company was expected to support the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the theme “information, publicity and entertainment”.
On partnership issues, Elsten noted that BBCs should make more efforts in such areas as “Sold concerts” (only he said would show up on TV), as well as engage in alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them accessible online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be managed by sound waves
The video shows how the intestines change the direction at a time when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by sound waves.
The fine intestines change the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high, so that the human ear can hear them.
Pulses are influenced by the activation of neurons, genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Another topic: Researchers manage brain activity through light
Scientists have reported that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, which is to use ultrasec to trigger certain cells of the brain, heart, and muscle, while the source of ultrasonics is not present.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at Soska Institute, La Hoyya, California, told Guardian that this technique could once replace deep brain stimulation -- invasive procedure in which human brains are being sent electrical impulses and used in Parkinson's disease treatment.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultraviolets, but Chalaani found that they started to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles increase the ultrasonic waves that then enter the human body of worms.
Intensified ultrasonic waves affect structures called "the ion channels TRP-4" found in membranes of some worm cells.
The Utrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and trigger the cells that are linked to them, as reported in the report in Nature Communications.
In order to create a nematode that can be controlled by an ultrasonic, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultraviolet to influence modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microsciental bubbles and injected into worms by activated modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in “optogenetics” - a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani claims that there may be some advantages in relation to this method of sologenetics.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right section of the brain on fiber optics, low - frequency ultrasonic waves pass freely through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to be carried inside the skull box.
“We believe that to treat certain neuroscientological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able, for a time, to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The prohibited torture equipment is on your threshold!
Advertisements are being abused over the British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International protesting the exhibition of arms.
Amazing killer droids!
Ruining needles of iron!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light lines, which cause pain but don't leave a trace!
The sound voice and figureless animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international weapon exhibition, the fossil of the world, was prepared by the Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to “press” weapons to the repressive regimes, using the ExCeL-based exhibition of defence technology and security systems at the doclands centre.

But a special campaign has also led to the sudden appearance of a number of pedestrians at bus stops and subway trains that require a second look.
"A major declaration, headed by the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" -- written in one of them in London Metro, depicting a DLR line that becomes a tank force.
In September of this year, a group of arms dealers will play on the DLR line.
The 300 posters are represented by artists who set out their jobs in the "Frequency Design" in the Banky Park, "Dismaland".
A collection called the Special patrol group has helped to distribute them throughout London by using a "reserved advertising grounds," a six-pound set of hot keys, which is said to “to provide access to about one third of the advertising space at the world's bus stops”.
Transporters of London are not happy with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized pods.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Group of the Ostemporial patrol.
According to Gavin Greendon, the curator of Cruel Designers and a teacher at Essex University, artists are more demanding and seek to bring political art to a audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest movements, realizing that they have to enter the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by a pro bono VCCP agency, with the assistance of a graphic designer and an artist who also works free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by a silent advertisement around an arms exhibit -- with an ExCel pass -- and thought, "Let them do a campaign that they try to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and cunning corporate ad, but "to fill it at home with bright colors and animations was a more exciting activity."
"They were incredibly helpful to us in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the topic of weapons exhibition goes from ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed the order at AT4CS RS to shoot the shoulder from the U.S. Army.

Eight gold rules in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student residence as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in adoption and moral relativism, but it's not until now that I recall the persevering smiles of those whom I've irritated -- and the many, long complaints against others.
Most of the time, what I have learned can be divided into eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitories can range from a slightly nervous to a totally frightening one.
He's urging people to tell you where you came from, whether you're academic and where you've spent it, whether you're Corbin, and why you're "rereally, I love or hate "Marmit", because seriously, boys, it's just a jerky Hamas extract, I'll be at my own place."
Give me a break.
And help others, too, ask questions and show interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people who you like, not people you don't even talk to, even if you're upset with, and they're selling fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Human rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, semi-morning cinemas and places of general tusks, but they are also places where people dress and manage underwear.
Still on the topic: Don't even start at university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a safe haven, but many living quarters form a culture of clothing from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication, and leads to long friendly relations.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to re-establish power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go away, and I can restore the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to feel like a fellow student who's tired of talking to him, not running into him, but texting.
By the way, knock: do it.
One guy in my apartment was following this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a drink.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the Bayke-Off show, you're going to knock on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a chocolate cookie plate, not so strange anymore, not so much as it was in the 1950s with their "Welcome, We're Neighbors, I'm in charge of you, and now smile, and I'm going to ask you some personal questions."
It's a great way to get together to offer your pets.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
The bad eyebrows of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be sleeping when you come to them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student homes.
Of course, a smoker is stealing, but isn't it stealing to take a little milk for her?
Get in touch with the owner of the milk.
He is most likely to offer you not to be shy, even if your anger is boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to treat this adulter than my roommate, who poured a dishwash in his milk to avenge those who don't demand him.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noise that prevents people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a good man, but you're the same people talking about glass houses.
A girl in my corridor asked a neighbor to take away the drums and bass fans because she had three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased his volume.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours and then stole his music and locked the door behind him for a three - hour test.
Would it not have been romantic if your future spouse had settled in the same house as you do?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be unusual until you were bitten by a elbow, it would be awkward for you to take a neighbor for your future spouse, get involved in them, break up their relationship, and have to see him every day, and maybe watch him drag on his side all your common friends?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if your hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the border between the play-up and the grass is even smaller than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting security lesson, hiding something but never going to someone's toothpaste room and champagne.
Take a strange door and put your keys in a glass of water that you'll then put in a freezer--but don't put other people's things in a blue-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, selecting General and then selecting Software Create.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump and install it.
Some have encountered problems following installation when a report on a mistake appears that they say, “According Application could not be updated”.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until the recovery dies or try to update through iTunes.
The phone hints will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the update, and also simplified implementation by means of an ad hoc utility, which proposes to delete the annexes and re-install them once the process has been completed.
It is worth making sure that when you update, your phone is loaded or is near the charger to prevent the battery from disposing.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update as the phone discharge in the process may lead to a failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow ' s military support to President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
The PJ Media reports on this.
“Secretary of State Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad from Russia posed a risk of escalation and extension of the conflict, and had a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, if we also did not continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power,” stated the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry, once again, stressed the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to resist the Islamic State”.
The White House representatives said last Friday that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
On the other hand, the White House press secretary, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama of the United States and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, had not yet come along: “When the President decides that the telephone with President Putin would benefit us, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call”.
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision to increase its support for Asad's regime is “a win-win rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the continued support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings, and as a result, the situation deteriorated," said the U.S. President.
The imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
Miniconomy intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of soft-off goods have been prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Associate Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported on this.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dimitriy Medvedev, on the occasion of his visit to Crimea, appointed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Mintrans Russian Federation, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of the Interior of the Interior, to prepare proposals for the establishment of an enabling environment in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yacht.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about €200 million annually go to the European treasury for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yacht.
The Russian Ministry of Economic Affairs has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes, granting full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating facilities for rest and sport.
The Ministry was of the opinion that this would certainly help to create an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Laskina.
The issue was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs and Tariff, Non-tariff Control, Foreign Trade Safeguards of the Executive Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development pointed out, the proposed full conditional release measure for import was essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol, the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation of the Ministry of Economic Development presented a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEC member States and explained to Lashkin.
The list of imported goods that are totally exempt from customs duties, taxes include goods needed to promote foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in science, culture, film, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc., among them official equipment (serious computers, writing machines), instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water trucks, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious purposes.
In the Ministry of the Press Service, Mintrans RF, “Investigations”, reported that mandatory orders had been issued on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Fedosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the setting up and exit of small, sports sailing and pleasure vessels at the seaport.
Mintrans is assigned to the captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure that the routine of small, sport sailing and pleasure vessels is simplified at the seaport and that the ships listed are released from the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders for the Government of the Russian Federation to approve the boundaries of the Crimea seaports.
In the case of Yalta and Fedos, orders had already been issued, the rest were being negotiated, and the press service had indicated.
In the view of Mintrans, the State, classification and inspection, the State registration of small vessels used for non-profit purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crime and Sevastoppol.
The problem is, in Russia, it's because of infrastructure that's weak.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole growing industry with a lot of people.
In fact, in Russia everything is in place.
Our coast is a little interested, only piece where yacht can be exploited every year is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helenjik, Novorosysk, Anappa.
But it is a major challenge to have a very strict border guard policy in this area: a mass of permits must be issued in order to walk in the yacht.
In fact, within Russia, yacht will not even be able to recover.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where she's supposed to be taken, says the sales director of the Nordmarine Denis Novikov company.
In the case of yacht storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht hangars up to 30 m. Also, yachts are deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
The newcomers noted that yacht buyers were wealthy, but the demand for yacht fell as the crisis began.
The World Bank has allocated US$ 500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for financial sector development.
The international press service reported this.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, states the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, seedao Fan, stated that banking sector reform would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank had witnessed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan is calling on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate the reforms.
Previously, the Polish Government approved the loan to Ukraine in €100 million, handed over to RIA News.
In prisons, individual units are requested for transgenders.
On the Public Council of the Federal Enforcement Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, other matters will discuss the possibility of establishing separate units in colonies for transgenders and transvestites.
The Council member Vladislav Grib told the news.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex prisoners in Russia, individual cells, blocs or even (if such criminals are numerous) could be provided in domestic prisons for the establishment of a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to determine whether citizens are serving sentences in such isolated places only after the convicted persons are subjected to appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the exclusion of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
He said that the proposed practice had been successful abroad: SISM (where the accused were held before a court decision) had separate cells for transgenders and special units in correctional institutions.
Today, it's the only way to deal with such criminals.
They must definitely be isolated because the presence of transvestites and transgeners in ordinary cells is dangerous to them, and this is a suffering for their families and the sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The decline of the transmissions by the fellow inmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city is, how many criminals with an uncertain sex, we should count on where to distribute them.
They don't need a single person - just cameras, locks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgeners.
According to Grib, 50 or 100 persons may be in the block, and if a specialized body is established in Russia alone, the sentences of prisoners of transsexual origin could be served in any region.
Citizens are held in SIZI at the crime scene, so the proceeds of transvestites or transgenders from other actors in the course of the investigation and trial are not valid, but the introduction of such practices for those already convicted in a separate colony is considered by Grib.
Recall that prior to that, law enforcement officials had been unable to determine in what detention centre, whether male or female, to identify a detainee who had been detained for 24 years by transsexual Dmitri Koukova (known as Alain Davis), which made it impossible for a man with a childhood to be arrested.
He was released home by a signature for non-excision.
The news was widely discussed in social media and networks, since there is really no mechanism for trans-gender detention in SIZOs and colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeev supported the creation of special places to serve the sentences by transgenders, noting that it is also possible to identify individuals in colonies - male or female - depending on their own wish.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of ensuring that homosexuals are safe in prisons, Alexev says.
Prisons must be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexeev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia willing to give themselves over for trans-xexuals in order to get to a place other than the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in bars for transgenders, but not all of them are always clear.
In the United States, for example, a prisoner named Chelsey Manning looked like a man, and he said he wanted to change the floor, said Alexev.
A man can feel anything.
But so far there is no room for serving sentences for transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordalpanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could seriously delay the beginning of the sentence for convicted persons.
A commission is created to be a matter of sexology, psychiatrists have long-term surveillance, and this is not one of the tests on which high-pretential detention is based.
Today's capacity for mental health is an opportunity to do so.
Therefore, before the sex shift, potential patients are always subjected to such tests — they are sure to show whether the removal of a sex with a surgical intervention measure is a necessary measure, says Lordalpanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system can be introduced against convicted prisoners, since it takes an average month for such a survey.
The doctor, while in general the idea of separate transsexual blocks was supported, also doubt was expressed that in the current economic context it would be useful to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It's difficult to estimate, no official statistics are available, but considering that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that the transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a bias and commit crimes are a very small number, says Lordypanidze.
At present, certain conditions of detention may be obtained by the homosexual, transgenders upon application to the administration of the colony.
Michael Antipas won a juvenile peace championship on chess.
In Hunta Mansic, the chess championship of the world was completed by 20 years of age.
The first line was more than intriguing.
The winner was only on the last tour, and he became a Russianman, Michael Antipas, who was still able to scare Jan-Kishshtof Dodu, who seems to have been a certain title.
A Ukrainian chessman, Natala Bux, was celebrated for the victory.
The chess championship of the world, which took place in Hunte-Mansysk since early September, seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue by the representative of Poland, Jan-Kishtof Doud, who issued a series of four victorys (in the Swiss system of 13 tours) and succeeded in taking leadership.
Given the fact that Duda was a predestination rating, and in fact, one of the most promising young chessmen is considered to be one of the most promising, the possibility that he would miss out on his arrival was very small.
And even when Douda reduced his pace and allowed Michael Antipas to reduce his backlog to just 0.5 points, he remained a clear favour in the struggle for title.
Because Antipatus had to win the 13th tour to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Doud your party.
Plus, this duty to win, of course, could have affected the game of Russian chessst and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipas was able to avoid them.
He was confident that he had dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he had to wait for his party to finish with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antoffov, Polish chessman made his opposition to the Dutch man absolve.
Antips and Duda thus acquired an equal number of glasses, 10 out of 13 possible, but Antov had the best extras.
It was therefore his leadership of the Hanta-Mansian Autonomous District, whose Governor Natalia Komawarov has traditionally placed great emphasis on the development of the chess in the region, that has served as the main prize.
But there was no intriguing end in the contests of girls.
The tour leader, Natala Buckse (Ukraine), was not to lose in the last tour, which she had done with success.
Thus, the victory of Aline Bilvo's rose prevented her from reaching Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second, leaving the championship at 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The Company is bringing the Prowg and Ural regions into one consolidated Volzsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
According to Vamplecom's creator, Mikhail Slobnoe, changes are being made to “remain for a strong market player”, to develop a company “in a new, not always supportive external environment”.
In an interview on "Russia 24", Mr. Slobono explained that they intended to reduce “ten per cent” of the staff in Russia.

As a result, a restaurant on the Volkola highway had been fined 50,000 roubles, and the establishment of the Big Tul Street had been closed for 90 days, but had resumed work after all the violations had been resolved.
43 bites violated the requirements for the premises.
Among other violations of poor sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, bacteria of a group of intestines were found in some facilities.
The Francessis on the Bruger King brand belongs to the Bourger Rus OO who owns Alexander Kolbov's network, and Russia has 293 tastes.
Igor Artemiev, leader of the FAS, stated that the agency was opposed to indexing 10 per cent of the freight and the provision of grants, as requested by the ROZ.
First they wanted 17% of indexing, now they want 10%, and then they want multi-billion budget subsidies, he says.
We say, it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much, you cut your costs, learn to save, give up expensive individuals, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its own, more stringent proposals, which were currently under discussion in the Government.
Postal reviews the possibility of a net account with Sumeru Gold B.V., instead of a full $300 million shares, reported by the gold mining company.
In this case, Polymale will have to pay up to $80 million (the difference between the sum price of Sumeru and market boilers) that can be derived from the free cash flow.
Soumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or to request compensation.
The details of the negotiations in the Plymeline do not reveal.
The option was drawn up as part of the purchase of the Polymale Project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stassishin, director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, said that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing procedures for disposing developers.
“We realize that this is not going anywhere, so we are developing the mechanism,” said the official.
The drafts of the movie "Grazdan Kane" will be put on the market.
Representatives of the auction houseProfiles in History reported plans to market the black version of the film "Grazdan Kane", which is considered to be one of the best works of film director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on 29 September and will be presented with three black scenarios, the estimated value of each one being $20-30 000, is transmitted to the AP.
The first of the nuns, written in 1940 by Hermann Mankevich, is the earliest scenario in private collections? It is known as "American" -- that's the working name of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final film plan.
Thumbnail: targeting food will not be the equivalent of a card to the USSR.
Vice-Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Eutuchov, said that the targeted food aid programme would not be like the food distribution mapping system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to look at the "food card" word.
I should like to point out in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food maps with the effect of the past total deficit, the mapping system in which the quantity of products received is satisfied.
We're still proposing the concept, if it's approved, we're going to propose changes to the law," gives the TASS the words of Mr. Eutuchov.
Previously, I wrote that a food card programme for the poor had been introduced to the Government.
For details on the Ministry's initiative, see Igor Szvaliv's article to prepare food cards.
President Rogosstrach wants to divorce his wife.
A prominent source of the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company, Danil Hachaturaov, had filed a complaint with the Moscow Court about the dissolution of the marriage with the designer of Ulya Sergeenko.
The case of the judicial section of Judge No. 100 will commence on 16 September.
Danil Hachaturaov asks for his marriage to be dissolved and his property to be shared together.
The court confirmed the existence of a complaint for the dissolution of marriage in proceedings, noting that the property division claim had not been filed and would be dealt with in the District Court.
President Alexander Bobresov is leaving his post.
The Vice-President of the OAO, the Russian Railways (RZ), on corporate security, Alexander Beresov leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-President of Russia, President of the Board of Directors of the RJA, Arcadia Dvorkovic, said that the issue of withdrawal from the RAC was initiated by a new head of Oleg Belozov.
According to the Vice-Premier, the repositioning of RJ in management is not linked to the change of head of company.
Formerly, “Odmir” reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakininne OAJ, the first deputy minister of transport, Lieutenant Oleg Belozer, who was a smoker of the financial unit, was headed by the former deputy minister of transport.
For the first time, the new head of the company announced reforms in a monopoly, creating a new cargo tariff system within a year and a half.
For more information on the changes in the company, read "Hour" in the "RK" will rewrite the value books.
This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1,000 Russian Managers" is released 16 times.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian senior management, the study summarizes the work of Russian administrators for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functionalities.
The start-up pool of candidates consists of last year ' s rating winners.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as the candidate for the current year's rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list offers to be nominated up to 10 new managers from other companies, which would be useful for inclusion in the overall pool of candidates.
It is possible to propose the following company managers: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert offered an invitation to the manager to participate in the rating and to appoint his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The promotion of candidates is based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and processing industries, machinery, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, telecommunications, services and consumer production, insurance, construction, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a logic and a password for entry at www.top1,000.amr.ru, where they see information about the remaining participants and can present their estimates under the criteria proposed for each functional heading.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of “The best choosers”: top managers value top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final ratings shall be approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current-year ratings and multiple candidates for past-year ratings are invited to attend the regular meetings of the expert commissions.
Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight committees to approve the heads of the functional areas.
The expert commissions are requested to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the sites are strictly according to the Internet evaluation and are closed before the rating is published) or to make their adjustments in accordance with the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of companies have been given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the PKK.
Changes in the status of managers and companies are possible at the time of publication of the rating.
Investment rate is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that 40 per cent of the market for credit for small and medium-sized businesses in January/April of this year was settled.
What do you think the situation is today?
Following the Panamanian moods of the end of 2014 and early 2015, the amount of ISA credit has declined considerably.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
25-30 per cent of annual loans were not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its possible problems in the future, from short to non-retroversial, it is now impossible to do so: the rates are still so general.
For business, the current level of ISA rates is not comfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their profitability.
The rate levels of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in and create attractive returns on a wide range of projects.
How much do you estimate is the demand for credit for entrepreneurs?
The situation has improved slightly since the CB decreased interest rate.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have begun to seek loans much less frequently.
Above all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future incomes.
Today's business is one way: we need to learn to work on the economic situation in the country and the region today.
We need to be careful about the current results, and we need to control the cash flow.
At the same time, when financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the product more competitive and to keep business even in a fragile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the ISA credit market that will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will interest rate change?
The lower average rate forecast will depend heavily on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, there is no radical drop in the credit price for the ISA to wait.
In the current situation, the problem was primarily inflation, which made it necessary to raise the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited in both cash replenishment and economic adjustment options, will no doubt pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and the street fashion.
That's how Mazda's word is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
The beauty, laconic, and at the same time, is quite difficult for those who are accustomed to cyrillite or Latin.
So, the new CX-5 KX-Corossor, as well as any other model of the stamp, is drawn from the outside, technically developed inside.
Japan's already simply because it's Japanese, it's able to connect to the products of the rising sun to a state of complete wonder.
There's a lot of reason you can argue for cars from other countries, and a person will agree, in principle, with those arguments, but the conversation is different from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing wrong with that!
Such people may have to love not only technology but everything else in Japan.
Citing from Basaé's journey, sending food to Wasabi, collecting a cat and putting on your girlfriend, no, not in kimono, of course, but in canons of visible Japanese fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties, both perceptual and strict.
And since the girl's older, that can be shorter.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But where the shape of the car changes more dramatically, a new pattern of the headlamps and the rearlights on which the car will suddenly find itself in the stream of the cars.
As in the past, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silatu is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the appearance is very strict.
We don't have to call the police.
A CX-5 driver, one of the world's most safe, can only experience stable Japanese peace.
A diesel engine of 2.2 litres provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litres s - only 5.9 litres. A force unit shall be equipped exclusively with automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can select the lungs from the Not Cross police tape.
In Mazda, however, you have made every effort to keep your own accident on the CX-5 track.
In order to further improve comfort while maintaining good governance, suspensions have processed the design of the front and rear amortizers and optimized the shape of the rear levers.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise levels at high speeds decreased by 13 per cent.
The merchant in the flower or strip is just as boring as the money sedan.
The other thing is, if a girl's missing in a bathtub with an original figure.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter's genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
New CX-5 has improved design for both front and rear seats, providing optimal space both for broad shoulders and for long legs, who possess anything.
It will certainly be appreciated that the stresses in the front part of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the phrases.
The largest range of active security systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to recognize the potential threat.
There's adaptive lighting here, and a warning of eastwards, and the monitoring of dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A person with a minimum yield is carrying 561 litres of cargo. The rear seats are divided into a ratio of 4:4 - each with a separate billboard - and the luggage compartment is extended to 1,560 litres.
The hero's bone in Japan is called kygurus.
It's a particularly boring look at the pajamas.
You can't do it!
Sure to sleep.
But another way to entertain little kids.
Or just taking a walk around the street like this...
After all, it's so great when it's possible to choose -- fun clothes, behaviors or cars.
Thank you for helping with the production of the Kuaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic media.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia on the dormitory of the Hmelnik Nuclear Power Plant.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday from the second attempt for the avoidance of the Moscow agreement.
The third and fourth cluster agreements were signed back in 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law that would terminate an agreement with the Russian Federation in 2010-2012 to build the third and fourth bloc on the Hmelnica Nuclear Power.
The draft law was implemented only by a second vote, and was first supported by 210 deputies, with an appropriate minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament were later voted in favour of the draft.
The Himlinian power plant of the USSR was originally designed to have four power-locks for 1 GW with VEM-type reactors, but only two have been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and, in 2011-2012, the Council adopted appropriate laws.
Since no funds were available in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but no funds were allocated.
Following the coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 and following the chilling of the two Kiev countries, it began to reverse relations with Moscow in the atomic industry by declaring that it was not to cooperate on the Hmelnik APEC project and on the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship remained remained was the purchase of fuel from the Russian nuclear power plant (calculated about half of the electricity generation in the country) since while Ukrainian NAEC, Energoat, had been replaced by Russian supplies.
The plans for the construction of the plant by Hmelnica APEC with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been completely abandoned: as early as 2014, negotiations with the Czech Scoda JS had been announced in Kiev.
UN Gensec vs. the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"No military decision," the AP answers the question about Syrian military support from Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the IED of the Permanent Members of the UNSC later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Nicholas Bogdanowski of Russia, Deputy Chief Genstab, reported that Genstab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future Air Force base in Syria.
Not yet.
"But everything can be," Mr. Bogdansky said.
Formerly, "Kill" reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to formal Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on the US's doubts about Syrian Russian assistance, please read "Ok" in "The Russian military presence in Syria is disturbing Washington.
In the PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Guárasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is scheduled this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," is the words of Mr. Herassim.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and for “to return to the normal functioning of our countries”.
To the question of whether there was currently possible dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, either in the “Normand format” or in the contact group format at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gárasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, the policy is that in Kiev there is support for any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, Mr. Leonid Kuchma, told us that the Doneska and Lugian republics themselves had not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations in principle, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties gave out their mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novorod Electoral Commission took stock of the outcome of the municipal Duma elections, which distributed 12 deputies ' mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations were made by the representatives of the CPRF, who accused them of taking the “courage of falsification”.
The opposition ' s comments were not adopted.
In one election, the Russian Communists refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the charges for the renovation of multi-family buildings.
The town election officially presented the results of the elections in the proud Lower Novorod of the municipal electoral district.
Total electoral rolls in Lower Novorod included 1.03 million people, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the Local Commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
Over 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their vote.
On the list of "Ed One Russia", six deputies in the hills rely on Dmitri Svakovsky, Dimitri Krasnova, Vasili Shupranova, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyaceslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagor.
LDPR received the sole mandate of the party leader Vladimir Girinsky.
The two mandates of the CPRF are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of Gosdura Alexander Tarnawiv.
The three mandates of the “Equitable Russia” are reached by Alexander Rosemov, Igor Bogdanaw and Mikhail Shalugin.
These candidates should now, within five days, be determined whether they would serve as deputies in the city Duma: if they relinquished the mandate, they would turn to the next candidate for a batch.
President Alexander Maceev informed the members of the commission that he had introduced the watchmen for the “telegrams of Zirinsky and others” in order to give up mandates.
In approving the electoral report, the representatives of CRC stated multiple violations.
A member of the mountains who had the right to a conscientious vote from CRC, Leonid Krasnokuski, suggested not to accept the outcome of the voting at the four districts of Nos. 21-24, recalling that the head of administration of the Soormov district had closed the entrance to the building of the administration, where four district commissions were located.
There had been a long time in which representatives of the Goss Ummah, candidates themselves, observers and the resonant scandal that had stormed the door of the Garden Administration, had been shown on television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions, with the right to be heard, had the opportunity to be present.
They had no access until the ballot had ended and the House Commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballot papers.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and the persons concerned could attend all the meetings," mated a member of the mountains by the sample of Natala Andruchin.
The Communists objected to the unlawful detention of a member of the Ludmil Aristian Assembly in a blocked administrative building for more than four hours, on which an application was made to the investigating committee.
The opposition also complained that in a number of IICs on election day, the ballot papers were printed at 6-7 a.m., with ballot papers for early balloting.
At the same time, the commissioners, with the right of conscience and observer, had not been alerted, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8:00 a.m.
The Communists are confident that, in the morning, before opening the polls, ballots could be dropped unsupervised.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints of different behaviours, said Alexander Maceiev, did not find any violations with the collection of unreported ballots.
They did not support the commissioners and their colleague's proposal of the “Equitable Russia” Maria Poppy to withdraw, through a study, as amended by regional legislation, in order to clearly set aside the time for the opening of envelopes with advance ballot ballots, which are later placed in the urnus.
"On your own initiative go to CIC," said Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergey Samoan, was charged with shouting that the sample ignored dozens of complaints and covered the falsification of elections.
"You're not here at the meeting, you're more careful about making a statement!"
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the election should adopt the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Lower Novorod city Duma of the sixth convening would be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the political party “The Russian Communists” in the registration of the initiative group for the local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to bring two questions to the discussion of the following residents: do they agree that the charges for the renovation of multi-family buildings need to be “immediate immediately” and the tariffs on residential services to freeze until 2020?
However, lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the treatment of “Communists of Russia” was contrary to law.
FedEx is a mixed product, a reduction in projections by 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits by falling demand for freight services and increasing costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were cheaply about 2.5 per cent on advance tenders 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends in May next, that is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast has been reduced by an average rate of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in ground freight charges for heavy or measured goods, which starts in November.
The company stated that it continued to plan increases in revenue over the past year as a result of reduced expenditures, higher gross income and increased online trade.
The Chairman and CHO Fred Smith said that the company “has worked well in the light of the weak, as compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The employment plans for the holidays were announced the following day after the competition, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 staff members, approximately as much as they had been hired last year.
In a quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the previous year.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share by zacks Investment Research with 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks had $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by the decline in the urgent international transport sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross income in its expansion of express transport.
However, the Internet boom has dramatically improved results in FedEx Group.
In the last quarter, land freight benefits increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained largely unchanged due to higher costs of large sales and self-insured operations.
The express-transport unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector, income fell due to higher pay costs.
Preliminary tenders, about an hour before the FedEx share opened, fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, fell by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most expected meeting over the course of a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week in a 27-foot table from the Honduran red wood, deciding whether it is time to raise a key interest rate in almost ten years.
At one end, a rich, decorated room, two floors high, will hang the veneer image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yalelen, and her colleagues should place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third commission may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost predicting decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is prepared to break off the unprecedented incentive offered by almost zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most data show a positive growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets may also deter the cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding a volatility by raising the basic rate on federal funds, even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Peggsa, chief economist of Stifel Nicolas & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rates that increased uncertainty around the world market, enough to justify their waiting for further," she noticed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve System, which will in itself trigger the fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a decline in the equity market if the Federal System raised the rate, provided that decision makers did not ease the impact of the promise that the next increase would be short.
On Tuesday, the Dou-Jones index rose to 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The flight was prompted by the expectation that those defining the strategy of the Federal System would leave the rate this week, according to John Lonski, chief economist of the Mudy's group of Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System raises the stakes at that moment," he remarked.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, “we will have to go far into adopting our strategy to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small one in a slow increase in financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yelen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a higher rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs were slow in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment had declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest in more than seven years and nearly the level that the Federal System considered full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the target of 2 per cent of the annual central bank, the Federal System management stated that the temporary impact of the surge in oil prices was key.
“The economy can also cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market”, observed Ian Scheferdson, chief economist Panheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China dwindled its currency.
The Dou-Jones average index for industrial shares fell by 16 per cent of the record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could hinder world growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow-Jones index is now about 10% lower than that of May.
In order to run the Federal Reserve System, resentment of the market further complicates the delicate calculation of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have turned a hook at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former member of the Federal Reserve System.
It is now predicted that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a greater uncertainty about what might be the impact on the American economy, and they have little reliable data after the recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not part of the main concerns of the federal system and should not be technically taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve System became a global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Just one hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "seek" its monetary expansion has caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science”, said Zakari Carabelle, leader of the Enterprise Inc., a company that works on global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there have been cases of excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not appear to be linked to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on a higher rate, cited the decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “noting the limited identified impact on growth in the United States,” said Laker.
One year later, the leaders of the Federal System cancelled the decline.
The Federal Reserve system should be placed first on the issue of stability only in times of great crisis, such as market collapse in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest committee at Bank of England.
The last panic, and he didn't get close to it, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are threatened by a rise in rates because of the shock of markets," said Paulsen, president of the Peterson World Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be in advance of events.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/contribution is open in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Cosco, LAX -C - the optical Thai market, which also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not in Tai Town.
The market/creature is a store where you can buy all at once, offering head-blown selections of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian food, kitchens, furniture, religious and sacred ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy some oil for the engine.
The grave's agnostic, and it's gonna take more hours to clean up all the ranks.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BQ Express.
The wells section in the store (good and inexpensive) is close to the cash register and offers various options for wine.

Spicer Gosduma, Sergey Narashkin, admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees flow into Europe.
As Interfax said, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of the conspirological theories, but the question is, Is it not Europe’s ultimate goal that has been the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with such manipulation?” he asked.
“Someone must have intended and knew that the flow of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing from death will surely be flocking to the prosperous EU countries” he added.
Nakashkin asked: “Many European political leaders have expressed frankly the causes of this crisis, a wave of refugees that is now literally affecting their countries?"
“No, old Europe, except for a rare exception, prefers to keep quiet”, he said.
In the view of Narashkin, NATO is in violation of many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at how the military saphoam, the NATO standard-based, is being expanded and the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are being expanded”, stressed the Speaker.
The ruling forces and loyal militias are opposed by rebels, mainly from Islamists.
Later, the prohibited terrorist group “Islamic State” in Russia joined opposers of the Syrian Government.
The United States supports rebels who oppose both Asad and IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria described the reason why the West was opposed to Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Asad in an interview with RT, First Canal, Cross 24, NTB, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act for the benefit of Western countries rather than for the benefit of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sudden outbreak of Western media with the outbreak of a coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, “religed from the second West against an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition that came to power in a non-democratic way, even though he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Asad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West ' s consistent statements that Asad himself should withdraw, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections and, if so, at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the President remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately”, he stressed.
Asad named Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the Syrian State was supporting the Syrian State in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He refuted the allegations that Iranian military units were being deployed to Syria.
Tehran is giving us military equipment.
“It is natural that there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been done”, he explained.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see it in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Hiquil coalition known as the United States” said Asad.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, the number of refugees 11.5 million.
Part of the Territory took over the terrorist group “Islamic State” prohibited in Russia.

Reuters, referring to the representative of the State Department, John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was a conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
In doing so, he stated that the United States had tools for “the further isolation of Russia” if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, passing on RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry, Lavrov, during his discussion with Kerry, reiterated the need for a unified front to fight against terrorist groups operating on the territory of that country.
Ways were also discussed to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Previously, United States officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow ' s support for Assad.

The beard called the U.S. newspaper slanderously on Strellkov.
The former President of the Government of the National Republic of Germany, Alexander Borodai, himself announced, refuted the information published in the United States newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview with Lenta.ru.
A notice in Whistington Post is beautiful because it's all turned over.
Of course, DHD Minister of Defence, Igor Strellkov, did not connect and “went out” him from the Republic of Donbass in a highly assumed mood, without ropes, without three pieces of money that he had signed with different characters” he noted.
According to Borodova, it was a conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper.
"Yes, I told you that Stralkov urgently had to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," he told the former head of Government of the DDP.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication had decided to write about the fact that the Storolkov had been taken to the Russian territory of “linked”.
I suspect it's provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's amazingly wrong to read, because I've emphasized that Stolkov was leaving himself," he remarked.
"It's slander on me and on Stelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post came up with an article in which Borodia’s statement that he had taken Strajkov to Russian territory by force.
According to the publication Borodai noted that he had to tie his secretary together.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
The Polish ladders began cutting trees over underground tunnel, where a train with the gold of the Third Reich is reported to be located.
Work started on Tuesday, 15 September, reports the Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing of the forest is necessary to verify the authenticity of rumours about railway composition with treasure.
There may be arms and precious minerals inside trains.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Lower Military at Tomash Smolash (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was far less convincing than previous ones.
The authorities, however, decided to spy on the area of search.
Three days earlier the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Jokowsky, had said that 99 per cent of the local cemeterymen had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich as is mentioned in legends.
Zhukhowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and jewelry were discovered, they would become the property of the State treasury, and no treasure would be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm turned to the Polish city of Walbows with a report that they found a train in a locked tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The RF Chief Drug Taxes proposed that tobacco should be prohibited to persons up to 21 years of age.
The Russian Chief Drug Taxes offered to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugenius Brunn noted that up to this age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
That's what he said in the live radio broadcasts of Golorit Moscow, commenting on the information that the Speaker of Sovfeld Valentina Matvienko had supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
The human race is not equal.
You can serve in the army at 18 years of age, and you are physically prepared to do so.
He has mentally prepared for a full life in society since the age of 21.
“It is known from the scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, will only mature by the age of 21,” said Brunn.
Previously, the member of the Public Chamber and the project manager of the "Dressy Russia" project, Sultan Hamzaev, informed the “Investigations”, that Matvienko had supported an initiative to raise the age price of alcohol and “jointly agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the matter again on the site of the Upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Council of the Federation to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Law on the Information Protection of Children
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Public Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law on Protection of Children against Information That Affects Their Health and Development, and read the statement to correspondent Sib.f.f. on 16 September.
The author of the application stated that on 26 August 2015, he had obtained a Bible from the Russian Bible Society at the Chitai City store on the Red Pass, 2013.
In the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violate the FM on protection of children from information that harms their health and development.
On 16 September, the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the town of Novosibirsk accepted the application.
Novosibirsk will respond within 30 days.
The point is not that you can ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, comments the applicant to correspondent Sib.fm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that will populate society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which was not done before.
The Brazilian Union of the Ri-Grandi paediatrics promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian SPRS paediatric organization has developed a scandal that aims to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants with breasts written with images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant women and women born are encouraged to increase the daily standard of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one rise in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor of health at Bailor College in Texas, found that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affected the exposure of genes from children and prevented them from developing their tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of poor nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
A school bus was chartered by a train near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, the train hit a school bus that got stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And then a minute later, they had a fight in their eyes.
One of the high school students took him to the video.
There was panic among the students because of the emergency situation.
Some children began to cry and run along the roadsides.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger of a train who was slightly injured.
The damage was Euro300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of the local athlete David Brown Junior.
The 28-year-old Brown died on Monday from injuries sustained by a Filipino named Carlo Magali.
One of the regional titles of the International Banking Federation (IBF) in the spring category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali Nokaoutat in the 12th round.
Brown got to hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and connected to life support.
At a professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two injuries, and finished the battle.
He's got two kids left.
This is a second case of flight of Australian boxers over the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport but rather, in its view, to prohibit it altogether.
I know it's not like it's happening on purpose, said Stephen Parrys, Vice President of the organization.
But as there's boxing now, there'll always be situations where an athlete gets hemorrhage or brain injury, causing either death or serious injury.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that includes practitioners of doctors and medical students.
Sergei Narashkin called on the OSCE PA to abolish sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Spyer Gosdumata RF Sergey Nariqkin has declared the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians impermissible.
He said so by speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable acts as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And that should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, said the politician.
In addition, Narashkin called on participants of the OSCE PA to re-establish the Russian and EU partnership.
Let's put the morality back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us bring back the humanist ideals of democratic world order.
"Two has never ended well," he said.
Addressing the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian Gozduma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I appeal to the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Narashkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
“It is almost the only common site where it is still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine”, the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will continue until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple or three days.
World champion for a light athlete by Sergei Shubenkov.
This season is called the Triumph for a 24-year-old passenger from Barnaul Sergey CHUBENKOVA.
He was able to win, at the crown distance of 110 meters, the barriers at the command line of Europe, set up several records, and become the champion of the world, the first in the history of the national barrier.
In addition, an athlete recently won the final phase of the Brillian League, taking a third seat in the total.
"New Confession" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the afternoon season.
Sergei, is the season for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be in Korea in October, and then think about rest.
True, I'm going to be at home right now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different state.
It's easier than every week to get around the world.
You once said that autumn is the time of year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The wait after the main start of the pumping season will no longer cause the load of responsibility.
We can make fun of it, on the lair.
Plus, you know, leave is pretty soon...
Do you have tiredness?
Still the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
Weakness is always on the rise by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what else you've done, won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent travels, relocations -- all of this doesn't happen to the body indefinitely.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, uplifting.
I'm just happy there!
By the time you're booked at the World Cup in Beijing, you're often back?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think the athlete who lives on the old win is making his best runs over and over again.
You've enjoyed winning a couple or three days, and you've got to move on.
The preparations for this remarkable season were very different from the usual season?
I can't say there was something special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter season.
He was first trained at a house in Barnaul, then at the meetings, then at home again.
It's as usual.
But with the coach, the challenge was to try to reach a new level that I had not yet been to.
Almost all winter time was spent laying down the base.
A bunch of sneakers were running, we had generalized training exercises, which included hardship, and our backs were rolled.
Then I went into my barrier training, and I did a lot of stuff.
Did the rivals follow?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with it in the Internet age.
I watched the winter championship in Europe, and there the French took all the pedestal in the barrier.
I thought we'd do something, we'd have to dilute this company.
With every start in this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all the last seasons in roughly the same way.
It's not like I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always gradually turning around.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on that outcome.
But the paradox is that I feel ready for feats, and at competitions it's not always going to work.
How was that, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I'm honestly the semi-final runner (Shubenkov couldn't take it to the final.) I tried to forget right away.
Ready for 13 seconds, really.
Even if I were to repeat my best results at that moment, I'd be a bronze prizer of the game.
But I'm not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Championship?
What about?
Tag had it.
I really wanted to get into the finale, I was such a mammoth program.
And he fell away from the morning, in the pre-trials.
Then I realized that to rip and carry a broken head is not to run anywhere.
Two years later, at the world championship in Moscow, the finale was out with the best time.
Well, I remember my feelings before a decisive escape, and I really wanted to win the gold!
How does it work to develop a comfortable pace, not to lose your head, not to turn off?
And that's the most complicated thing.
We need to be very careful, focused on technology so we don't get into barriers.
I noticed that when you're not worried about the outcome, it's much easier to process.
And it's when you feel like you're running and everything's being done!
To be honest, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes are trying to move closer to the capital after the initial major successes.
Never been that kind of thought?
The house is better anyway.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
You've been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, I've been in a light athlete.
More precisely, I first trained his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started off with a sprint, and then I jumped in the back of a jump, a triple.
The baby's robin was when the ball was set, jumps to the length of the...
I was 14 years old and ran with barriers, and I liked it.
The first run has met the standard of the second adult level.
That's how it stayed.
Never been afraid of barriers?
Somehow it was easy to make a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
He's been suffering a lot!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technician needs to be dragged away all the time - so I can wake up at night, I'm up and running through the barriers.
Everyone who saw you running in Beijing says it was a very nice run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't see how I run, and I couldn't stay here.
But there is no limit to improvement in efficiency.
Don't you be afraid that winning a year before the Olympics takes on a heavy load?
In such cases, it is said, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you have chosen this road, you must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no extra load should feel.
And I agree with him.
Cushanashville’s Islander
Well, I'm not as naive as being able to come up with a reaction to an interview in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand, their bread doesn't feed -- give it to them, throw the enemy.
And even though I didn't get around the flag, and the same thing is exactly the same thing, a million times I talked here, and I didn't call anyone directly a bastard, another deal.
All of my pseudo-boys are off, and in a second they're out.
The Pressing I'm being subjected to is so strong that even I, who issued a kind of pranker, think people have become mad.
As if he was walking, walking, and attacking you with a crowd and mutating in the lanes.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm gonna hit a tape, I'm old, I'm afraid.
The other thing is that there's no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best I ever had was self-sufficiency, so you could bite it.
And giving passports to such freaks as Fred Derst or Monson can only be stupid.
It's better for me, the best journalist, to be a shame.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanasvili described in a sharp way the Crimean events:
What we did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's exactly what annexation is called.
I think that the reference to how a higher-level Khrushchev tried to sign does not fit into the general picture of the human host.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his apartment...
The Kremlin War's gone and it's only gonna end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, she started off calling a little bastard from the Kremlin bar.
I'm guessing who it might be...
Cobson doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they carried him a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
Reconciliation now only depends on Vladimir Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven is on a rating despite trying to highlight the leadership's failure at Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to highlight the impact of the Liberal Party's statement to release the leader's seat was unable to raise Today's high ranking.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital of the State following the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull Tone Ebbot.
The Concuritant - Sunrise - with David Koh and Samanta Armitage - is stuck in London through a one-week series of international broadcasts, which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This experience seems to have had little meaning for Australian television viewers, with Sunrise audiences accounting for 397,000 spectators in five of the largest cities than Today's audience of 339,000.
Today won a little higher than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343 000).
Today's been reducing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
There were 318,000 today in August, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators against 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the clarification!
TODDAY published on Monday, 14 September 2015
An important news story for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star series Palips to Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father-in-law who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could handle a popular show alone without a Rafters Rebekki Gibney star.
The result of last night is a loud yes response.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with 1,136 million spectators, easily surrounded by The Block (838,000) and the TBL Familias (726 000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure on the second evening of Chase Australia were confused.
The first half-hour (from 5:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Kifi collected 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00), the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators, enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyar (613 000).
On Monday night, Chase Australia’s first half - hour meeting was 520,000, and the second half - hour was over 720 000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fallout of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate 5.30.
Chase Australia is a substitute for Million Dollar Minute, who couldn't play McGuyre's show.

Three physicists are unanimous in that Sam Wood is the perfect guy to choose, but who will he choose?
The secret is open?
Lana Jevon-Fellas, Sara MacKay and Snejana Marcoski may have accidentally been able to figure out which one of them will win "Holostic".
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in the Honstika, surrounded by a curtain of secrecy.
The three girls who reached the final line, of course, keep silent about which one of them received the last pink.
But when we met with Sarah MacKay, Snowy Marcos and Lana Jevans Fellas on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were supposed to be left, they might have been reluctant to give a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood continues to remain silent until the finale, to be held on Thursday
All three women come into rudimentary moods, telling why Wood is the ideal man, and when they think about his sense of humor, purpose, family values, lifeliness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But when they answered the question, "If you don't, who should have the last rose of the Wood?" they could have pointed out who of them really won the heart of the Lobster.
Jevans Fellas and Marcoski were no doubt called MacKay the ideal couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam formed good relations from day one.
"From the moment I was among the participants, I felt the energy (Sari) and the energy of Sam, and I realized that they were very suitable for each other, and I did not doubt it throughout the whole show," said Jevos Falows.
"Sara is a very open man, easy and fun," adds Marcoski.
I saw them together, there's a tension between them.
They feel good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah MacKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay himself said that because of her dating home last week, she realized that Wood might be the man.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and my family, I realized that it's definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
To question who should choose Wood if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Szejana and Lana deserve to be equal.
The Bachelor comes out in Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten channel.
Originally published, "Sara, the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jarrida Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Setett were very interested after moving to the United States -- as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some of the trainers would have left Hayna on a bench on the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian League of Regby let on his first return to the win-win game with Minnesota, with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayna another chance to return his master, and also involved him in the game after Reji Bush's trauma.
Tomsula was on the right side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of trying to make newcomers in front of the team, he whacked them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayna at a press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter at 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hein also received support from Thomas McGoy, coordinator of special teams, who suggested that he forget about the lost ball and think of the next game.
Jarrid Hein lost his ball to return the pantate to the Minnesta Wykings team during the first quarter of
At this beginning, the debut of the NHL Hein and his numerous Australian worshipers clearly did not count.
He's seen going away from the field after the ball's loss, and then he told the lead show Hemish and Andy at Australian radio station 2 DayFM 104.1, which couldn't imagine a more unfortunate start for his career at NFL.
"This happens, you're just thinking about the next game and all," said Hein.
Heave compared his debut to the Origin game series in 2007, when the ball shot in its set-off zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
This experience eventually proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
He took a picture of an Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture at Instagram.
Elton John and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at Siberian airport.
President Vladimir Putin, who had been condemned by Khodorkovsky, had openly challenged President, his oil company, Yukos, had been confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy had been suppressed.
Migrations to the police took place at Hungary's border.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reské, which had turned into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police have applied water and tear gas to Reuters.
Migrants stone the police and try to break the fence at the border.
Support is being directed to the scene of clashes, police officers respond to acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Aguence France-Presse, refugees managed to cross the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Wenger border on buses towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports “Bi-Fi-si”.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to come to Croatian territory and ensure that they were transported from there to a country of need.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the involvement of the army in the protection of the State, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and an accelerated asylum procedure.
The Hungarian Court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serb border and will therefore be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament will also consider, as soon as possible, the transfer of responsibility to the armed forces of Hungary for the protection of the country ' s border.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175-km barbed fence on the border with Serbia to deter the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian man admitted to being the largest of the Caribbeans in history.
Vladimir Drinkman, the largest Russian cyberattack in the U.S. history, confessed to the theft of more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey Drincman, a conspiracy was made to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russianman spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks for 15 companies.
The cumulative damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Such defendants, such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security”, said U.S. attorney Paul Fishman.
Drincman is in danger of 30 years imprisonment, as well as a $1 million fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confession of a Russian man and may reduce his sentence.
Dinkman's sentence will be read on 15 January.
Vladimir Drincman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smith, was taken into custody.
The last one who blames him for the crimes he has committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry, Sergey Lavrov Secretary of the United States, John Kerry warned that the support of Russian President Bashar Assad had exacerbated the conflict in the country.
“Secretary of State Kerry made it clear that President Assad's support for Russia risked exacerbating and widening the conflict, and also undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition,” states a report published on the U.S. State Department's website.
Kerry reiterated the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State (for which the Russian Supreme Court is prohibited) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Asad "never be able to be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the Syrian conflict could only be resolved through political transition from Asad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of Joshua Ernest's White House, a press secretary threatened Russia with isolation if he did not stop supporting Asad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorism operation against the “Islamic State”.
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian soldiers in Syrian territory.
At which the head of the Russian MID, Sergey Lavrov, claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to absorb technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police opened fire on the protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets at the crowd protesting the proposed new Constitution, as the official stated on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday, in Rupande district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dalal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at a police station, and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dalal reported that police officers used tear gas and then shot in the air before they launched rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last few weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where the Madeszi people claim that new provinces under the new Constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protesters also went to the west of Nepal, among the packing citizens who wanted to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and the officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise of 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as the center of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
The outcome of the first year of work, new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent, "The Lord."
Oleg Valerjevic, where did you start working as mayor?
I first learned about the results of financial and financial audits and initiated an independent audit review of local budget expenditure.
An audit of municipal property was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce documentation to five days.
Previously, the papers at the stations could walk for months.
Income and cost engineering activities have been developed.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the Government was held in Sainsk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project document (PAS) in the city for any facility.
Without it, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the OSS on the road, kindergarten, northern sewerage and water supply.
Roadwork in two sections is now under way.
How does the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens apply in the city?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Sainsk.
Such positive demographics have not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of securing places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
On 1 September, the capital repair of gas station No. 10 was closed for 320 locations.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
The kindergarten, which now visits 200 children, was opened last year after repair.
The renovation was made on a regional and local budget basis, with a value of over 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the provincial government, funds for furniture and equipment have been sought, and aided by the Natural Initiatives Programme.
There are plans to start a new kindergarten in 2016.
With his input, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have shoes for children from three to seven years of age.
Investors are interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city has to be done, first and foremost, by the Sian enterprises, and that they need to be provided with jobs.
As early as October, a 60-bed orphanage for orphans in Leningrad.
In the area of construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities in Priangary, which entered the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 clusters will commence shortly.
All of us have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, and this value includes the “key” section.
If we cope with the amounts assigned, we will continue to participate in the program.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In due course, the Sajana pigbox, which in 2004 was sold for bouts, was built on the Territory.
We're working with the Public Prosecutor's Office to challenge this transaction.
Even more so, the land under the targets is federal property.
Work with Moscow is under way, the transfer of 88 hectares to the provincial property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the 1.5 billion roubles project.
We're going to have 900 jobs from the top of the pigbox, which is going to be a big help to the city.
In Xansk, was the institution of social partnership developed?
We have some 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Several projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of the business.
Activities such as the East Centre OA, the New Zealand TEC, the Seyan Broyler OO, the MDF OP, and the management of these enterprises will respond to all appeals.
Directly by the Day of the Sayane Broyler OO, the city of the town was given a gift to the children's town, and East Centr performed a renovate of the horseyard, where professionals deal with child-repatriation, costing more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the funding, the city office was able to improve the area of the city ' s office.
The sponsors helped celebrate the Day of the City.
As in old good times, there was a parade involving city teams and organizations.
A city story was released, a book of Saudi poets.
The first-employers and people who have made a major contribution to the development of Sayanska are provided with jubilee medals.
Seats also participate in the city charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months more than 8000,000 roubles are aimed at supporting talented boys to help children in need of expensive treatment to support children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere addressed in Xansk?
The city lacks doctors and job teachers.
The provision of housing professionals is essential to resolving the issue of human resources.
Over the past year, we have provided five accommodations for doctors, and four teachers have received office accommodations.
We have a housing programme with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
Plans include the reconfiguration of the building, which will build an additional eight rooms for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Living for the Russian Family" program.
In the future, construction of a home for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with whom I can handle the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a Social Indexing Bill, taking into account rising prices.
The State has introduced a bill providing for the indexing of social pensions every year, from 1 February, taking into account rising prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rummanians, a Deputy of the Fair Russia, also proposes an additional indexing of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth in the subsistence minimum exceeds the increase in the price of goods and services.
The social-pension index, in accordance with existing legislation, is produced annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the FF over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower chamber provides for the introduction of social pensions indexing, taking into account the rate of consumer price growth.
The first indexation is carried out on 1 February and the second index is on 1 April.
The Head of the OSCE PA has told Moguerani that sanctions against parliamentarians cannot be imposed.
In an official letter to the European High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federike Mogerini, Speaker of the OSCE PA Iqka Kanerir, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the Assembly ' s activities were unacceptable.
The journalists were informed of this by a member of the Russian delegation at the fall session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nicolai Kovalev.
As reported by the TSS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy and Greece, were gathered in support of the Kanerwa position.
"There has also been enough strong support," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the Head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures of deputies that indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerir had promised to raise the problem to the level of the leadership structures of the European Union and “to send an appropriate petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low pressure area is approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands, with 60 per cent possible turning into a tropical cyclone within 48 hours, reported on Tuesday at the U.S. National Hurricanes Centre.
Another well-defined area of low pressure, approximately midway between the Green Cape and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 per cent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, reports the Miami synoptics.
Google launchs a double-emergency campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced the launch of a donation campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist European fillers refugees fleeing war-torn countries.
Google used a non-cardial personal approach, anonymously to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google staff member Rita Masood, who had been in trouble with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We traveled on questionable trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperate for help.
Donations will be made to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until it reached $11 million on the page of google.com/refugeelef.
Europe is facing the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has brought more than 4 million people over this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

A small - obesity diabetic can help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of obesity surgery on people with low obesity of type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
Now, however, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with low obesity live longer after a surgeon’s obesity than those who receive non - surgery treatment.
"The mortality rate is not shown at all immediately," said Dr. Robin Blaxtone, an expert on obesity surgery, writing about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the capacity of organizations to absorb food.
Over the years, baritarian surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
ITT, the measure of weight relative to growth is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
ITT 25 or higher says that a person has an excess weight, while people with ITT are considered to be over 30 people with obesity.
You can calculate your ID here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Taiwan Hospital in Min-Shung General used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of baritarian surgery - stomach pelvising and gauze gastroctomy - with the medical treatment of 2 types of diabetes with low obesity.
The average ITI for those who were subject to surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, ITI has approximately 29 patients who receive non-surgery treatment from diabetes.
Among those who had undergone the operation, 36 per cent had been cured of diabetes and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the drug treatment group, by comparison, only 1% of diabetes was cured, and in part only about 2% of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerids and "bad" LPN cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group", the authors claim.
Researchers also monitored the levels of hemmoline A1s in blood, which reflect levels of blood sugar in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c should be held below 7%, by researchers.
After surgical intervention, the average hemmolobin rate of A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8 per cent.
But the best indicators of hemolymetic control, reflected by the good levels of hemlobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the research director Dr. Ching Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the group that had filled the ganttextomy, the spinal group lost more weight (18.7 kg v. 14.2 kg), achieved a higher reduction of IMT ( 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemolobin A1s (3.1% against 2.1%), and was closer to the full diabeta remission (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life after five years, there is evidence from a study of excess body weights in Sweden that surgical treatment actually increases life expectancy, according to the University of Arizona, Blaxton of the College of Medicine.
According to a Swedish study on obesity, the risk of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blaxtonon noted that this encouraged people with IT below 35 who are interested in such procedures.
“The report is very important because it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in a group with low IIT, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blaxton added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient's IM goes between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they dig up the genetic changes that start obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In the Arts, robbers removed the Shubas and 9 million rubles from the house.
In the Arts, robbers attacked the people of the underground house and stole 9 million roubles and three women's coats.
It is reported by Interfax with reference to the Ministry's press service.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open door entered a house located on the street of Horkow, tied a 20-year-old son of a housewife and, threatening both, abducted 9 million rubles and 3 coats.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the damages amounted to 9 million roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading “Front”.
Fantas in Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Herrburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will visit the soccer World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not yet in a hurry to obtain a permit.
In the view of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world succession, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the visitors to the city.
Rosbalta's interlocutors believe that because of the tour, the rent cost of the rented apartments will increase by 10-30 per cent, and that after the championship, they will have to overpay for the rented housing.
The World Cup championship led the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically under predominance, each Hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it is consistent with the claimed number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that this will not be possible for all: the hotels are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS Head Wadim Vladimir, the agency has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 cases for hotels, many of which have simply not responded to anti-monopers.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies deceived the citizen by placing a number of stars in the advertisement, noted Vladimir.
The problem is, at this point, literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during a football championship, the sick people will take all the Pierburg hotels.
Currently, 305,000 can count on tourists in town.
According to the Smogl, in Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-hour hotels, 100 two-and-three-hour and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gevvic, the first Deputy Tourism Development Committee, only 23 hotels have been classified so far, so many of the audits have carried out the companies accredited to Petersburg.
Whether a hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, there is no known situation by surprise.
So there may be more of a class, but no one knows about it.
“The last six months of hotels were not very keen to be classified”, admitted the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union to Ekaterina Shadski.
This is due to the high season, during which the hotels earn the most money and refuse to do other business.
Another reason is that budgets that did not incur verification costs, with hotel arrangements ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 roubles or more.
Recently, however, hotel leaders stepped up and applied for classification, assured Shadsky.
The hotels have to be won before 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine but will not be allowed to work on the world's championship.
It is already known that, depending on the starry, a fixed fee will be created for the hotel number at the time of the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be made public next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by between 200 and 300 per cent, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience, and we don't have to let the hotels grow by two or three times, but we also have to let the hotels earn their wages.
"I think it's going to grow up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimir, for his part, is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of a market economy.
I don't know how much this goes into an economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's a best free trip," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen with popular cheap hostels.
The Deputates of the Gosumats have introduced a bill that requires hostels to be banned in residential homes.
It is our hope that this law will not be passed or that it will be applied to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostels must be preserved," says Nana Gwachia.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-Holes should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If Gosduma still approved the bill, about 80 per cent of the hostels would be closed in Petersburg, and there are now 1.5 thousand.
According to President Leonida Garbar of the Federation of Rectors and Hotels in the Northwest, there are two or three-star hotels in Petersburg that are just claimed by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation where "at the 80th stage, there are 75,000 people sitting."
You can fix that at the mini hotels right now.
Their possible prohibition is that the expert believes "idioism": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, and that some people can't come."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel to which the guests arrive for a short term, why not?
The mini-domestics are at risk of missing a World Cup championship and because of their sloppyness.
A whole hundred little hotels just don't get through the classification, and they play themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city would be ordered.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not large enough, so they will abandon less paid orders from mini-hospitals, and they will choose those who travel”, said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example Moscow and Volgograd, the figures of the checks that have been completed to date are much higher than those of Pierburg.
The reason for the Hererburg delay was that it was not conducive to concerted work, including the constant movement to the Government ' s tourist block.
Experts were of the opinion that if there was not enough for the Peerburg hotels, it would likely be necessary to pay attention to regional hotels and recreational houses.
By the example of the 300-year-old of Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized into the city, that is, guests can live in cabins.
In addition, many sick people will be trained to come on RVs, where they can stay overnight.
"It's good not to build so many hotels that they're empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
Realistic housing will also be popular during football training.
Most likely there will be a reserve of rented apartments in town.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
“From the obvious, the first to leave the dwelling near the stadium,” noted a development and research specialist at the Agency’s real estate, Laris Bragin.
The rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
It would also facilitate the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
And we should not forget the human qualities of the citizen.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that Petersburg has always been a guest city where people are not just showing the road, but they can also take a mini-currency tour.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970, my mother and two children.
There was nowhere to sleep, and the hotels were hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interviewer.
True, he added, there's nothing left to do with this shit in town -- calling at home with consequences and fear.
But will it be in 2018, after the failures of the Hodumas, the mistakes of the hotels and governments, that will have to be remembered?
Jirinsky Ossil, Amursky.
I was thrilled to see the Zyrinsky clown in Gosduma today.
He did things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and he is still in excellent shape.
The theme of the presentation is “LDP protest against the results of elections in the Amur district”.
The protocols do not shake, because there are no other protocols except those signed by the samplers, the LDP does not appear to be in place.
He's raising his second seat, Ivan Abramov, saying, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then, after the heat is over, he's driving a faction out of the room, saying, "You're all with the fronts of your gums and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abraham, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a result of the scandal and insult.
Real Wolfović is beautiful and elegantly salted Amurska, together with Abramov.
For the whole country, it is the regular departure of Zirinsky in the “Podniks” style, not a protest by the political party against the results of the specific elections.
And the faction has been formally disappointed, and the election, if you believe the party's website and Facebook, is not recognized, but the leader from the topic is obviously coming.
It is up to the dead in Amur to bury their dead themselves, and to preach against the One Russia in general and in no way should Rodney.
It's an obvious decision not to lose a person or to go to a real and show-off scandal.
Another thing is that Abraham himself is in a strange position.
In addition to his superiors, he had nothing to wait for, there are no protocols of alternatives in his hands.
It's not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, it's the same thing as it's the formal act to insult a respected championship, and what's so cool is, the Hasm attacks on the E and the UNF.
And, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because of the main beneficiaries of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only regional onemanic district, it can become a couple, who have been successful in using their own party leadership and the super-extractor for the same UNDF and the party leadership of a stranger.
Well, definitely, it wouldn't be Girinsky, he should have been made up and watched.
The tram is still growing and growing before it.
There's been news that LDPR will be back in the hall at the next pinnacle.
I mean, the banya's fallen out of nothing at all.
The only thing Abraham's theme is to be buried.
It's beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" -- Dalai Lama -- RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, saying Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalay Lama Centre in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that, in existing circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this was a source of admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for the response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring true peace and development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush ' s actions after the terrorist attacks 9/11, stating that the U.S. ' s strong reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that it was possible to solve the problem through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children swallowing a hand disinfector over the past four years
Toxicology centres in the United States reported a nearly 400 per cent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who had been swallowing a high-spiral deinfector, according to the Georgia State toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Ellard López, director of the University of Georgia toxicology Centre, the incidence of a misappropriation of children to 12 years of liquids for defusing arms reported in toxicological centres has increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are more frequently associated with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the ambulance office," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquids purposely, and some do it to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Video videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
It is reported that adolescents mixed a disinfectant liquid with a alcohol - laden mouth fluid in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Young children may be attracted to pleasant smells of disinfecting liquid.
"The baby doesn't think it might hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attracted (deinflective arms liquids) are those which are aromatic.
There are disinfectable hand fluids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The hand-depositing liquid is somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Small children, in particular, have only a few sprays that can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of toxicology at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a bowl of whiskey, but people are holding on to the appearance of these disinfectants for their hands, and if children get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naja Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a tuber-smart disinfector in her school, was sent for treatment to the ambulance.
Her blood alcohol rate was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritzchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Glinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Najia said something and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate baby clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchi.
"It was very scary," said CNN Scott, Naigi's mother.
That might have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-spread substances or disinfectants, in addition to removing disinfectants from their hands from the children ' s area.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting liquids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a death agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “opposed” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to a police report.
The teacher had severe allergies on her hands, and she prohibited them from being kept in her class.
The police considered the plan to be a failure to speak freely and addressed the discipline of the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance of the N.K. Children's Library, the Grassy owl is sad.
Babies who come behind books try to feed her with candy.
Several generations have been in this library for 95 years.
The earliest readers of the twentieth century spent their great readings there, performances in Mayakovski poems, and works of literature and correspondence with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted four years, and as the newspaper The Young Constant wrote in 1939, the day of the “friendship between the Hope of Constantine of the Krasnoy and friends of the Baraula Children's Library” was getting stronger.
Constantine’s hope even sent away a picture of a long time ago to distant Baraulian friends.
And when the Baraulians asked if Hope Constantineovna was opposed to having her name assigned to the library, he wrote that there was no objection.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the early readers have to explain whose harsh profile is in the library building.
During the years of adjustment, different people called, complained: Why does the library not change?
Let there be a library of some good child writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything behind.
"Croansky" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul as a "lininka" in Moscow.
On the floor is a yellow brick track in a library guide.
"The Wizard of the Evil City" is a favorite theme of the Oli Moscow artist.
Olya used to be a legal company manager, come to work at eight, go five, and all other managers were different only from love of painting.
And then I found an online ad saying, "There's got to be an illustration for a book."
I wrote a little American girl, and she was called My Cancer Mom, "My Mom has cancer."
I thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
She now works in a library, illustrates the children's books of writers around the world and she makes stories.
Traditionally it is thought that children lose interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we're going to the children who read, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, which is the director of the Tatiana Kuschd library.
In recent years, we've even come up with such a moment of confidence that the library is needed, and it's going to live--the kids are coming here!
I think interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby, there's a big exhibition with an updated photoposition.
Once a quarter of a week, new photographs of readers go to the library all over the family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is happy that the popes are increasingly coming with the children.
At the age of two, if the child has read the whole Chukow, he needs more books than he needs.
But now there is a law which prohibits eight-year-old Vanderkindy from issuing books from category 12+.
To get a book like that, a child has to bring parents -- they come back, then they come back again, and then "Croan" becomes something like a family club to them.
There are treasures in the library, the pre-revolutionary collection of beads and cheeses, and lead Corlenco in the annex to the magazine Nevia, the shelling of the Mussilka for 1936.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book's temple right now, we're now open to movement, we're trying to become a special place: not a house, not a job, not a school -- explaining Tatian Kuschvid.
We can all come together to read, play, paint.
We've made the playing area for the baby -- the kid's just going to play, and the arm's still pulling on the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they're backed by legs, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come with cols -- and we're glad they put the library first in all of the other places where they have to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says, "Modern children like we used to love classical child literature."
“The case of the Government is now under development, and much attention is paid to the authors, who are the links between generations.”
And when it comes to little babies, it's important for them to have some hero traveling from one book to another.
Children don't like to part with their heroes.
The Library regularly issues booklets to parents describing what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing as adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is prohibited to produce books outside the reading room for adults.
This magic privilege only has children.
...the library's most distant room has a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, a repository.
The feet are gonna yell under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book as an old friend, hi, good to see you and me not changing.
Ellie's still doing the same fun on the road, used with a yellow brick, the Tol Ritzkov's flair of magic, and Malchis-Kibalčish didn't tell the cursed Vyran bourgeois that's a strong word for him.
Books like passwords can be found in any place.
There are real book liquids in the vault -- for example, the pre-revolutionary collection of bean with eggs and raccoons.
Or take Corlenko in a famous annex to the magazine Nevia.
Or "Mursilka" for 1936.
The time has gone by, and the pages are painted in tea.
These publications are no longer published.
It's a piece of our future collection, and I'm dreaming I'm gonna retire, and I'm going to have a rare childhood book.
But the kids don't want to say that, and the old books paints aren't very bright, and the themes... open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Commosol.
Now I think, why did we all write this Pioneer truth?
But it was still interesting to say, "Rust Planet", Galina Ilysus, who runs a bookstore.
The Murzyka pages are dark from time to time.
Galina Vasylvena takes the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of the bouratino cap, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's team at the caviar championship, where Carlson uses the motor snooper, and who Father Alice Selinoff works for.
The library is paid very little for its work, and all those who can live without these book rows find themselves a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced are the educators, educators, and ministers of book worship.
They're also seen in a smile - it's considered to be the professional figure of a children's library.
If he smiled at you in the first minute, he's a professional.
I like children's books, how a library I like to be, so they're all straight and beautiful on the shelf, and I love reading them, says Galina Vasilvevna.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me.
And since I loved them insanely, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the fads.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Hearing mill: There's no difference in Selta.
Griffiths denied talking about the differences in Seltika after he admitted Daila that "Hups" is in a bad situation, but he's gonna make it right.
Harts will protest against the Scottish football association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity.
Dons increased its advantage over Seltik to five points
Adam Rooney's Pentalth in the first secret gave Aberdin a little advantage over the Gamilton in Pittor, which allowed the Dons to break away from Seltika for five points.
Griffiths refuted the discussion of disagreements
This caused rumours of the disagreements in Seltika that had been suppressed by Griffiths, claiming that he and his teammates did not suffer any intense criticism in preparing for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players want it.
Dutch people are bored because Scottishs aren't fighting for title - where Bur
Former Rangers half-guard and former Dutch staff member Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football fans lost interest in Seltyk because he doesn't compete for title to the Rangers.
Where Bur, now a representative of Ajax, said, "There are no more games in Holland that show the most attractive moments in the game "Saltics," and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about "The Star firm."
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Star Company games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Daila admitted that Seltik was in trouble, but the Norwegian trainer swore to change everything.
The defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the League of champions soon followed the play of the 10 Aberdin football players, who are now at the top of the table with five points.
However, Dale said, "Salita has had bad periods before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's pretty sad, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need the support of Celtica, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warberton with mistrust is waiting for January transfers
Despite the views that had emerged just a couple of weeks ago that he had defined some of the goals of the January Transfers, the Rogers' boss, Mark Warberton, was mistrustd of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
A former attacker, Brentford, said, "Janwar transfer window is very different from a summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Micha, who's interested in Seltik, was about to end his career.
The attacking Sonosy, who's connected to Seltick during the transfer window, was saying that he could leave football after his contract with Luggy was over.
A 29-year-old player was suffering from problems with a ankle for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to stand up against SFA against Neilson's allegations
The Harts was with a 2-1 account, when Patterson was removed, and they lost 3:2, but the defence's red card was later cancelled; this is the third Colorum red card, which was cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up on his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tincasle
The stubborn player of the Hiberinian team got a speech after he admitted that he was singing a song with insulting words about the former player "Harts" Rudi Skell.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn district in Edinburg, before the start of the Edinburg Dybreb on Tinkasla in March 2014.
"It was a thug, and it was a burner," said the attacker, adding, "I'm sure to say that I wasn't going to go back to Tinkales if he didn't play Seltik."
Donnelly, the advice of Tannadis is sure of the management of "Dandy United."
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors, Dandy United, remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation, but agrees that the deterioration of the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare them to come out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad that the "unintelligible" won the Himilton.
Derek Mackenness admitted that his team, Aberdin, had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assys in order to win the seventh consecutive victory at thepes of the league, which put them on five points above the Salicus, upstairs the prison table, by means of the Adam Runy's Adam in the first secret.
McInness said, "There's no team here to win something -- a cup, or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like this."
Unemployment among Scottishs remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
The total number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained 164,000 between May and July, while the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom than in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as indicated by the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with employment now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland declined to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister of Scottish Affairs, David Mandela, commented on the latest figures: “The Government's Plan of Action laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year had passed since Scotland had made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we saw a further improvement in Scotland's labour market with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why I am a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, while avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will look at the human being being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it's not, I'll sit on the watch gallery in Oklahoma prison when Richard Glassip is executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, because of his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in America, and because the results of the black lottery decide who will be chosen are often greater than the places they want.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats decreased from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glass's closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison authorities claim that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of being impartial in Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes to get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could have “better formulated” herself, but she still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glassip didn't agree with any of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he was talking.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help to move towards the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellever, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the subcategorists I've written down.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glassip is not responsible.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there is a greater likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the death penalty evidence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm gonna be a whole target.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
You'll know from me what it's like to watch a person I like die without need.
A person under police custody was told to get out of the Canning River.
Canning-Weil Constable managed to get a man out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police but failed to get stuck in dirty water in the shallow water several meters from a police officer trying to "quick him to go ashore."
The Canning-Wila Police were summoned on Tuesday by illegal entry into foreign territory at Bakkingham.
When the police saw the suspect, he tried to leave them by throwing himself to Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," Senior Sergeant Chandel Castlean said.
The Constable Laclan Perhavez didn't really want to learn uniforms, so he used a safer reception - "Constables with a Good Policeman".
"Then people do strange things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Cassandan.
This is exactly what Ben Kazins' football player remembered.
In 2006, Kazins went into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Suon.
His efforts were in vain, but the locals were encouraged to cross Ben Kazins' wires.
Peter Moody accused the soldiers of trying to spy out and threatened to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the facets of Racing Viktoria of trying to set up a spy in his convoy last year and threatened to leave a horse sport immediately.
His target was the facets and ethics officers Racing Viktoria, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and his removal from the beginning of Lady Tatai because of the violation of the rules on the use of drugs on the day of launch, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
The Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always exerting himself in jumping, and he was in a difficult situation when he spoke of a positive outcome of the Lydari test on the cobalt, which he could not explain.
He's been holding a language about suspected spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it makes you so out of the wheel that you don't have any more restraint," said Moody.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you respond, and then you have to live through the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep fast.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's wrong, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Formerly, the Moody made a sensational statement during an interview for torture.com that the ethics office tried to spy on his stable.
"A year ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a room with the person I would call if they asked, and offered him a job in my stable to give him information on what I was doing in the stable," said Moody at Riding.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they will certainly have to make statements because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former President of RVL, David Moody, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondra, External Executive Director of RVL, know this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't RVL be brave enough to be responsible for what's going on in this business, other people than the trainers?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license from me and push me away, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and place responsibility on them for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The trainer's dose was only increased during a long time's investigation of the qalt and Lidari case, and the last removal of the horses from the beginning forced him to state that he could "solve his license to the table."
The wise, the most famous thing that Black Kaviar's unconquerable champion did, described the use of medications on the day of the competition as “syrechodic” after the horse's feet were subjected to clay pressure, which is a violation of rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
“I must have full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees has mistakenly done pressure on her leg.
She could've got a concussion last night.
She could've got it yesterday, like it was.
She was with him the day she ran.
The wise may be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the press competition, where the stewards opened the investigation.
It's anecdot.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's too far," said Moody.
Driver who has committed a raid and who has been hidden from the scene in Kbrama, arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcycle in Kbrama during the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne hospital on a helicopter with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Welly Hayway this Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcycle.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident in Natalia left the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kbrama, remains in the hospital stable.
"Melburn Storm" Coach Craig Bellamy is setting up charges against rivals for the use of hard-assives.
"Melburn Storm" coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as the "dang of an agenda" on the part of two NRL champions.
Trent Robinson, a trainer of Sydney Rusters, said that judges had allowed the “Storma” to “fight” with his team during the sudden victory of the Storma at the finals of the qualification game in Sydney on Friday night.
Wein Bennett's Broncos coach made a clear hint on "Stor" after his team won a final qualification tour at Noserin Queensland Caubas on Saturday night, when he called this game a "standard" for the tag and said that two of the Queensland team weren't "wrought" in a hand-cuffed suit.
Bellamy was protecting the ball with his team and saying that they were just focused on "Contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident that he was critical of his team from the two leading trainers, because that meant that they were worried about possible defeat by the Party.
"It's still going to rise -- I didn't hear Grant Robinson talking about hard times when they played us with 24,2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our own systems or in defence technology, just over the past six weeks, we've paid particular attention to contacts in intercepting the ball, and that's been a turning point for us.
It's been a three-year trainer, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "express football" by reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illarre Dregons" was winning the 2010 football championship, showing "sucking" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with us on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was, he noticed Bellamy.
I remember in 2010 St George criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football game, especially his young paralegals at their speed.
It's football you'd like to play when you have these games.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants everybody to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-guards like Anthony Millford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play that way.
This gives me more confidence, because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to a big game.
Bellamy also noted that the "Storm" and "Rusters" game was a competition with more points than the "Broncos" and "Caus" games.
Broncos game, was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, it was 20,18, there were two more attempts -- and what, it's an impressive football?
Or is it an impressive break and failure?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At the Storma at the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to accept either "The Queensland Caubaise" or "Kronllal Charks" next Saturday at the preliminary finish at the AAMI Park stadium, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
The drug possession charge is released on bail of $200,000
A man facing life imprisonment for an attempt to add 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximović, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay Yath from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
During the entire morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen in the harbor, and later he met them in the Comera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds [40 kg] of drugs in a Toytho car.
Despite the fact that Maximović is in danger of life for an attempt to embezzlement narcotic drugs in amounts sufficient to sell, counsel Maximović argues that there is no evidence that the latter has tried to obtain the whole batch and that the man could have been in a cafe without intent.
Peter Fleng's Supreme Court judge doubted Maximović had to bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he said to the court on Wednesday.
During criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Mothers and fathers Maximovic were invited to provide a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It is evident from the testimony of both that the sum of the $200,000 bond is too much financial for them”, said Judge Flengan.
But one of these measures is not sufficient as a guarantee that he will not disappear, and the judge added.
The Maximović was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he would surrender his Australian and Serbian passport to the police every day and respect the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Fatis Casticaris: "I am in charge of a assembled Greece that has been fighting before the last few seconds."
Fatis Katicaris, the chief trainer of the collecting Greece, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the Eurobasquet 2015 finale with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Katikaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
Trying to work in defense, errors in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland, "CCA will be given me the functions of Kauna."
CHCA's new girl, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in the curse of the Armenians.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win Europe in the next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, myself, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Freeland, and actually I will be assigned to Sasha Kauna, who left the team, both in protective construction and in an attack from a three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to adjust to the center position, but at the NBA, I'm still more at the trourdes.
Now you're gonna have to face a big competition, but I've done it before, so I think I'll be able to do it now.
The Armenians last won Europe in 2008.
Six times since then, they've traveled to Fanala Four, but they haven't been able to show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team's been smoothed.
It's all a game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustrations of the club and its sick.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, then we have a good chance to win Europe, I really think.
I've always wanted to win that title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSA.
As for the flash, I'm not a superstitious man, and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination if you connect these two things, everything is possible.
I don't have any ritual in front of the games, I'm just listening to music, and I'm trying to relax as much as I can.
Louis Enrique, "My match with Romome will be special."
The chief coach of the Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the League of champions' group tour with "Rome" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his present and former team’s immediate privacy would be far from personal.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained for the “vols” in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself on the best side of the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, and I've had some experience.
I have extremely warm memories with Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start with the League of champions out of victory.
The Augustn meeting in Kubke, Joana Hamper, will not have an impact on the teams' actions at the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the "Rome" game that she showed up in A's series against Juventus.
It's a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skrypchenko: "The Rasnodar" has different attack options."
The Acting Chief Training Officer of the Urala, Wadim Skrypchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Prime Minister's match, noted the diversity of the attack teams of the rivals.
According to the mentor, "crowds" have several models of attack in their arsenal.
The escort will take place on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
As we're playing with "The Rasnodar," we're going to see that the official Urala website of the words of Scripchenko brings back.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different kinds of attack options, carrying out its attacks in a variety of ways, but we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given the fact that the "Casnodar" game of the League of Europe is playing against the Dortmund Bersy, we're going to be very well prepared to win.
Rocher Kanjas, "The House of Astan" can take the glasses from anyone."
"Astana's colonist, Roher Kanyas, after the match of the 1st tour of the League champions' group tour with Benfikova (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In Havbek’s view, the Assyrians are able to select points from any rival in their field.
Although the match has been hard for us, I can tell you that we were playing well, bringing UEFA's official website to Kanyas.
Benfika's above class, but at the home match, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
That's real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarea and then Atletico.
We can take points from anyone in the home match.
"The first time you want, Krishtian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
The chief trainer, Raphael Benites, expressed satisfaction at the great victory in the game of the 1st round of the League of Champions group tour with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the fortress Krishtian Ronaldo, who was the author of three heads.
The match was not simple because Shatter knows how to drive a ball, and it gives the official website of the WEFA the words of Benites.
There weren't many moments for the rival, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying Real played perfect, but we had enough fun opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and kill four.
Krishtian Ronalddo has confirmed his level.
This is the best player in the world, I'll repeat it as many times as I like.
Alba: "Crištian Ronaldo can't be compared to Messsy."
The Barceloni defender, Georges Alba, believes that no one will ever be able to compare with his co-clubman, Lionel Messy.
According to the Spaniard, there's also no way that Krishtian Ronaldo can do this.
- What Leo can do is no one can do.
Even Krishtian Ronaldo.
With Leo, everything's changing on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel de Rossi: Barcelona not only has a unique style but also a bright individual.
Daniel de Rossi's half-guard on the eve of a group championship in the League of Cups with Barcenoe, noted the importance of compactity and security in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow time.
Remember, the SE will do its text broadcast.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, quoting the official Web site of UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard for blue-graves to play, because they're not only unique, but also bright individuals.
To keep them, we're gonna have to bury each other throughout the match and feed each other.
The Messiahs are almost always successful when we are in the ring, so we need to keep compact and organized.
He's hoping to go to the SCA's start-up game with "Singled."
HOCper Ilya Ezov stressed that he was hoping to come to the start-up of the army at the next KHL championship.
He left for ice instead of Micco Koskini for the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the discharges at his gate, the fourth head of the SSA missed after replacing the altar with a sixth-field player.
The next match will be the team on a trip against Slonana.
I hope I'll go out to the next game in the start-up room, bringing up the words of Ejavev.
I'm not a larator expert, I'm a larator myself, we don't have any heads to repeat, so it's hard to track.
"Dinimo" was good, everybody's got bad matches.
The team's lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarjova got to hospital with a virus infection.
Lucy Shafarjev is hospitalized with bacterial infection, says AFP.
To date, the Czech tennisr is in a clinic in Brno.
The recovery dates for the Roland Garros-2015 finalist are not yet known.
We also recall that on Monday, Shafarzov rose to one line at a WTA rating and is now the fifth world rocket.
Stephen Hog used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to question images of violence against children.
Stephen Hog took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered with the Internet communications service, where she received a number of lewd images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing, and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogga.
She checked him and found shocking photographs, immediately drawing her mother's attention to him.
The police came and saw five images, and then they examined computers found at the address, and found “conforming” requests in the search engine using words to detect the indecent images of children.
Hog then told the police that he did it, because it might be "to attract pedophiles," and then he would "to pretend that he was a police officer to scare them."
The court officer, Eiled Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dundee, "He said it was passion, he was afraid of people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and about what he had requested to send photographs.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent images on the phone, and then the accused was treated with a clear stake.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and "Training" to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road in Dundee, found himself guilty of being charged with producing indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions of bail on 25 January this year and not having brought to trial on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, had asked not to add Hogg to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, since it was possible to prove that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, until he obtained a certificate from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but was detained before the hearing in other outstanding cases.
He was listed as having committed crimes of a sexual nature before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior political leader of Africa, fell from a hibernation ladder earlier this year.
He was unaffected, but the video on the stage was rapidly spread across social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by statements by the parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats warning them against arsonizing Mugabe during the treatment.
A month ago they woke up with the president during his address to the nation in Parliament, which was the speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Democratic Change Movement, Innoent Gonezé, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages from their mobile phones warning not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“Communication came from a number that is not represented, but is entitled Death,” he told journalists at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned members of Parliament that integrity ends in the building of Parliament and that, as soon as they emerge, parliamentary integrity is null and void.
A member of Parliament stated that a party led by Morgan Tswangirai had threatened her politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs under its restructuring and service delivery costs programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered on the Exchange by separating computers and printers from faster developing hardware and service sectors.
Estimates for expected job cuts would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, as stated in the statement Hewlett-Packard.
“Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the portfolio of businesses will be broader and deeper, which will help to move the company to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual income of more than $50 billion and will concentrate on providing previously inflexible integrated technological solutions to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
The company formed in the 1930s by the University of Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto called it “the place of birth of the Kremlin Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in a process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer, and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, a recent development in this sector based on the belief that a small number of specialized companies are working better.
Captain Micel Artett's Arsenala says that his co-clubbers are supposed to support injured Jack Wilshire in front of a game with Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that, provided that the restoration of Wilshire was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game of Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will miss at least four of the following games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains a question.
Most importantly, in this recent problem, Wilshire was confident that he had completed the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was going to return to the habit of aggressive pre-sessional training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bulging bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
This may be medically related, but as Wenger also allowed, there is a risk of additional trauma for any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries in six years from his debut.
In addition, it played only 65 out of 157 Arsenala games in the last five seasons.
If you look at an Arsenala schedule, it can be seen that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007/08, Arsenal was one of two Prime League clubs with the most daily injuries.
Wender recognizes the possibility of being caught in a vicious circle, but Arsenale believes that better injury statistics during the last season will continue.
"In fact, when you come back after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for some time -- you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's quite young and can do it.
I hope he'll be restored physically, I'm sure, as well as his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal is launching a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagrab and will continue on Saturdays with Chelsea and on the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Hungarian intends to rotate.
Ektor Bellierin and Aaron Ramzi didn't come to Croatia, so Matya Debushi and Artett are most likely to play the starting point.
Wender may also join Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Jir in lieu of Nacho Moviria and Theo Volcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little break to the players who need it," said Wenger.
Although the Arsenal is an unconscionable language in group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most prodigious in Europe.
Danimo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they were able to spend the last season as Unconquerable.
On Tuesday evening the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned a lesson from the past season when the team defeated the League of Champions game of Monaco, and remains with little hope of bringing the club to victory in the Cuban champions' finale.
"It's an incredible coin," Hungarian noticed.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm actually on the train.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriedsFest: a comedy show that taught us the serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is in the eye, especially given the despair of the need for honesty now more than ever before, while the suicide rate among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are more than three times more likely than women.
In an effort to address the problem of the "Abysses Against Unforgivable Life", a man was declared 2015 to challenge a culture that did not allow men to seek help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that if a patient has a sufficient number of friends in a normal mood, the chances of healing doubles.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the cycle of emotional well - being doubles the likelihood of emotional disorders.
But of course, friendship works, first of all, for it to be.
At a time when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, rapid response is often more appreciated than meaningful communication.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving, and successful, even if loneliness prevails in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely on domestic values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently noticed, a video player, you don't actually buy any more happiness for money.
The value of Frieds is that they're drawing attention to this.
Each character was determined not because of his work but rather because of the personality that was revealed in association with his friends.
You know, Yumor Joey and Chandler's constant embrace, the moments at which she's watching football on comfortable chairs, the breaths of Ross on Rachel are all based on the understanding that men can feel that way, even though they often refrain from doing a full study of their feelings.
As staff member Samiriens said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and sadistic about how even the smallest association of friends can be of benefit."
Often, the men who approach us feel unable to talk to our friends.
The old teaching of "live with this" is strong, as does the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Frieds is one of the show that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose more long-term working mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the low-note moments of male friendship.
With regard to my mission, the status of outsiders talking by telephone helps people at times of despair, but the long-term support comes from family and friends.
So, if you go to FredsFest in Common Central on this weekend, where for the holiday you've completely restored the decoration, why don't you take your friends to Central Peck for a drink.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Rather than guess the benefits that friendship can bring.
The Frends series shows the Common Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, the #FriendsFest tag
Di Maria kills her naked by helping S.H.G. destroy the Malmö.
Anhel de Maria on the same footing as Blaise Matui and Edinson Kavani celebrates the shot balls at the Malmö gate.
Anhel de Maria, who was debuting in the League of champions, beat a needle, which allowed SLV to walk around the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Anhel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their business when Parry Saint-Jerman started his game in the League of champions with a very convenient victory of 2:0 versus the Malmö at Park de Prens on Tuesday.
De Maria beat her ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of champions began as a game of M.S.S.S. player to set off the champions of France, but they missed a lot of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani hit his head for 61 minutes.
Along with the Real Madrid and the Black Creeker group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, because they were not aimed at qualifying the Pleas-off, but at continuing a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached up to a quarter of a million.
They earned their glasses, but at the same time it wasn't the best decision on the part of Laurent Blan to count Zlatan Ibrahimović as useless in the attack and to replace him later in the field in the game against the team of his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win homes or guests in the League of champions, so we're going to win with 2 to 0 and get problems and play protection well, it's a good start, even if there are other moments we're going to need to work out during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I regret we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injuries to a Paris team replacement, which brought her two to a match with his "Bordo" at the First League in the weekend, but was taken to the back of De Maria's plan for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the PPS to a new level in Europe after being ransomed to Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he had escaped to a pass from Marco Verrati behind Malmö's defence, and beautifully completed the attack by sending his ball to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected a light and a big victory then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won Seltik in his play-off to reach this stage, consisting of nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defence counsels and two middle-field supporters, was a serious opposer.
But except for the blow of Nikolaa Gurjecz, where the ball flew past the long pants of the Kevin Trep's gate for 34 minutes, they attacked quite a little.
But at times, SPF failed to do at least five of its own, and then was unable to process Kavana's ball just after it started playing.
Nevertheless, he showed himself to be far more skilled in the exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich who, Diya, sent the ball with a gloved blow, which took her foot to Wiland’s trouser for 52 minutes.
The second head was finally killed after an hour's mark, thanks to Kavana, the Uruguayan shot his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimov was refilled with a ball sent to the center of the left flange by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the interception of Viland's ball from a distance prevented David Luis from raising his final account before Esicel Lavsy was replaced by a needle at the end of the match.
A Mallme coach, Age Harayde, later admitted that the PSG was classed above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Staffing is not enough.
Hail Parry!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Cinpin's visit to Washington
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official statement that the head of China, Ci Jingpin, would come to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Ci Zinpina's first visit to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also accept Ci Jingpin's wife, Pan Liuan, at a government dinner the same night after two leaders have held bilateral talks.

He has been found guilty under the article “Violation of the traffic and operation of vehicles” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the Court granted part of the victims ' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the debate of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that the victims be dismissed in the full amount of eight million roubles.
The accident in question took place on 22 May about three o'clock in the night in the area of the 30-to-Kutuz Avenue.
The BMW vehicle, which was driving Mirzoev, crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcycle on the side.
The man died from his injuries in 1989 at the local level.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and on the sidelines in front of the accident.
In view of the driver’s attempts to escape from responsibility, the bikers organized a Motorway from the Vorobier Mountains to the Moscow building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the interrogation investigation had delayed the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
A nude man in Moscow was detained.

The capital police detained a Moscow resident who entered one of the temples without clothing.
The Moscow Agency reports on this.
As the head of the press service of the Ministry for Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, reported, the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, about 1,600, on the Kashir highway.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did not commit any unlawful acts.
The police arrived at the scene.
The law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the emergency psychiatric ward and handed them over to the man.
They were 26-year-old Moscowian.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakishev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen district, Vladimir Yakutsev, at a meeting of the Presidency of the Regional Government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and health institutions in municipal institutions.
In particular, funds for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Lowestatadin district, for the major renovation of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As noted in accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major maintenance of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The maintenance of hot and cold water, water, electricity and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the building ' s front, the renovation of buildings, and a range of fire and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second Forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, in which the Tumen delegation, headed by the Governor, will participate.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of cooperation is presented by the distinguished Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tümen, Vladimir Shugle, who was a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The massive event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko are scheduled to participate in the plenary session.
As part of the plenary and sectional sessions, the experiences of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, regulatory and regulatory support and programmes of the Federal State will be considered.
The Governor of the Tumen district will speak.
I think that this demonstrates the successful, sustained interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be held.
I hope that the forum will help to enter into new, beneficial contracts and agreements.
I'll add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tumen and the Minsk region.
The importance of our work is further highlighted by the fact that the ongoing seminar in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Russian Union and Belarus has been held in Tümen.
In addition, APC Tümen's delegation visited the Republic of Belarus to learn from Belarusians' experience in training for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the agro-industries complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakishev was speaking about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under modern difficult conditions.
The supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be considered necessary to reduce the cost of end-user machines.
Issues were discussed at Belshin's Tumen Trade House and options for prevention of loss.
Issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring benefits to the region.
Further supply of the OAO passenger and cargo equipment was referred to, the development of the IMMA service centre, which was set up in Tümen at the TATAA base.
The discussion also involved the preparation of a visit by a working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to reach a new level.
The regional centre also dealt with these questions.
During our meeting with Tümen’s head of administration, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
Some 100 buses are already “drying on the laid”, so a new shipment of cars from Belarus that will work on gas, clean fuels is required.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading elevator producers of the OAO Mogilevftmash, receiving a set.
In my view, these activities could become more active in view of the programmes for the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
I will add that, as part of the extended powers of the Consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurganese province, Alexe Kokrini, during which discussions were held on increasing trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaire.
A meeting with the Om governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five entities of the Russian Federation, but the Tümen is designated as the district headquarters.
The region is a polygon for many promising projects, including the work of an honorary gene.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good, allowing for a direct and speedy solution to many of the problems, reducing their severity and fostering mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it is essential not to break the gap while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposed focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon challenged the American producer Effy Brown, saying that we don't need to take into account the ethnic composition.
During Sunday's show, Project Greenlight on HBO, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the scenario chosen for the project.
"Multiology is appropriate when you're holding a tape for the film itself, not for the show," David insisted.
"Ooh, nothing, nothing" all the time, while an actor from Marsian was giving comments in live air.
In order to discuss the finalists' show to Damon and Brown, producer colleagues Ben Afflek and Farelli' brothers joined.
"I would like the participants -- who's not interested in being a director -- to think about what images of Harmony they're going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute that's beaten up by a white pimp.
The film producer, Die White Pople, advocated that film directors become Leo Angelos and Christine Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying, "This is not what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks were struck by the disappropriation of Damon.
A Twitter user, MrPoni, spoke angrily about the video showing: "A clarification of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the room is TAKO BELA, which hurts."
The Twitter got more than 5,000 retwitts and 4,000 Locks.
Damon's observations appear just when literacy coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, Black Lives Mather became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour of the population.
In February, a singer, Princes, referred to this movement during the presentation of the applicants at the Albs Al-Zammy Awards ceremony.
"Albombs are still important," he said.
As black books and lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, Black Lives Master leaders issued a formal statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member Elizabeth Hasselbek about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Master Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
It has recently been announced that Damon is included in the list of leaders of the show business, producers and media manifests who have been invited to visit the Pope in Rome to discuss the Catholic Church’s name in the West.

"American Ninja Warrior" benefits the first champion
The professional rock and the assistant official, Isaac Caldier, were the first winner of American Ninja Warr's show on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
On this sports show, the 7th season of which just ended, none of the participants had been able to cross all stages of the road with obstacles.
During the final season, two participants, Caldier and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75 - foot - long rope up in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the first task and made it in the given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, which went through the exhausting phase 4, but Kaldiero was able to make it three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After winning a victory that had been hard enough, Caldier, who was shocked to win a million dollars, interviewed E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year," said Isaac to journalists E!
And all of a sudden... I've never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
The executive producer, Kent Oued, met with journalists, "The Hollywood Reporter," to talk about the finale and why Britten, who first went through the trasy, won't get any money.
According to the rules, money is the fastest participant.
"If there's more than one finishy player, the prize is the fastest one," he said.
Although money is a marvelous reward that changes lives, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of excited feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
The show of America Ninja Warrior will return with the eighth season, which will begin to be filmed in the spring of 2016.
Detoro Tigers is quietly passing on the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEALPOS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroite Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Taigers, is now in the Central American League.
The presupposition is just to be confused, Taigers won on Tuesday at Minnesta Twins, with a five-four-to-to-Tangert-field.
Twins lost the chance to cut the backlog from Houston Astros and take second place in the Pleas by number of points after winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which shrunk from them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they're getting," said Brad Osmus, manager.
Pete Teigers Alfredo Simon made his contribution to support the attack, resulting in Detroit getting three points in the first two innings, and then adding one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a singer in 6-1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start in nine days.
"I just want to finish a year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers can't be replaced by each game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Viktor Martinez, the target hits three strokes and hits two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes from the four beats of the game against Seatt Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He showed himself to be (sometimes of the beta), clearly better at the beat, and maintained that quality for the game.
He took three wounds in the second half of the seventh Inning, Twins took his best chance to go back to the game.
By the Central Accepter, Byron Baxton opened inning with a hole in the left-hand line of the field.
Raitfield Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second Bayman Brian Dozier got a strike out of Simon before Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy walked around Moer, the only player on the road, before the new named Middleel Sano, who beat the two-man shin to the left of the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
In the case of a pair of pilots not in the auty and a matching wound at the second base of Verhagen, it was possible to bring the third bassman Trevor Pluffa to a severing hole.
It was the 27th time for a leading top league player in this season when Pluff hit the ball on a dal.
After Detreit added the insurance wound in the first half of the ninth Inning, Moer got RBI "dalm" into space between the autfields against the closing Tuggers of Bruce Rondon, and the account became 5-4.
However, the right-wing player beat Sano after three strikers and got his fifth safe.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes’s temporary failure at the start of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved playper who was on the pre-play injury list, missing more than a month due to an inflammation of an lumbar.
"Surely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game develops, I've become more comfortable and so I've been able to do some pretty good things in third Inning."
After the first beta reached the first base, he threw a single to Ian Kinsler’s second beam.
An oc at the 2nd Aouts of Gottfield, J. D. Martinez, led Victor Martínez, who made a single in the middle for the first time in the game.
Victor Martínez finished his "0 for 21" series with the pilots in an effective position.
The player of the third base, Nick Castelanos, was tracked by the snow, bringing another wound, but Victor Martínez was beaten up in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Teigers increased the second Inning account by receiving a single-point "dable" from Catcher James McCanne and a two-ute single "sea" of the central striker Anthony Gouz, and what became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hive," said the manager, "Twins," Paul Motor.
He didn't beat much, but he got right to the right point.
Hughes, who was thought to have been thrown into the back of his eye into a third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-hand Rider, A. J. Ahter.
He count three wounds for six hips and an ear with four strikers.
NOTE: Tigers ’ Pitcher-Rights, Aibal Sanchez, left the players in connection with the breaking-up of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's surgery on his shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of traumas since mid-August, is scheduled to leave early on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sánchez, the pilot-left Daniel Norris will leave the list of injuries and proceed against the Twins.
Norris, who left Taigers on four occasions since his acquisition in exchange for David Pryce's pilot, on 30 July, has one victory and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since 20 August because of the tension in the bone muscle.
Taigers and Twins will end up with a series of three games at the Taylor Field on Wednesday.
In opposition to Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play the test-rights of Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadiv's complaint was lodged with the South Sakhalin Court in the Malba to God book.
In the South Sakhalin City Court, an appeal was filed by the representative of President Chechnya Ramzan Kadrov for the decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book “Molba to God: its importance and place in Islam”, reports Interfax, referring to the President of the Horud, Alexander Chokhray.
The Court will now wait for possible objections from the participants.
The plague refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State of the Russian Federation to test the court's court's ability to cooperate with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahara City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natali Perchenco's decision to accept the book “extremist material”.
The Public Prosecutor's Office of South Sahalinska appealed on Friday night.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, they believe that they have asked the court to accept the opinion of the author of the book as extremist only, not the ayats of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision,” said Chuhray.
The decision to recognize the book “extremist material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular were the quotations from the Quran, "We worship you and pray for help," "Don't call upon anyone besides God."
They called the people who decided on the book "Shitans and Provocators."
He called on the Deputates of Gosuma to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred texts.
“I firmly believe that the State must adopt a law prohibiting judicial decisions relating specifically to the text of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, wrote Kadarirov in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
Combating the manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network, the Facebook leadership intends to work with the German Ministry of Justice.
For example, on the previous day, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, said that the Ministry was currently working with social workers to establish a special team of motorists.
It is the responsibility of its participants to monitor and remove unadjustable comments from migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is anticipated that the authors of non-retlerant posts will receive notice indicating the reasons for their removal.
The operational freezing of illegal content should also be facilitated by organizations with expertise in collecting complaints from users of abusive posts.
Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The removal of posts containing negative views on migrants and refugees was decided by the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobia had increased sharply in the German segment of Faisbuca.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the scaleless migration crisis that covered the European country some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the facilities intended to accommodate refugees are already overcrowded today.
On the eve of the day, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp of Buchenwald.
The displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
The Moscow cemeterys will have areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital graveyards are equipped with specialized zones for relativation and psychological rest.
Among the first to be found are Butovsky, Domedewsky, and Szszbinsky cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Troykrov cemetery in Moscow.
Other areas of the city will be affected.
This portal, m24.ru, was told by Artem Equimov, who is the head of the State Budget Agency Ritul.
Relativation zones will be represented by small, green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, visitors to the cemetery can rest, be alone, and restore psychological strength in such hotels.
The rehabilitation zones will soon be built in Domedewsk, Butovsk and Cerbine cemeterys, and then elsewhere in the capital.
According to the head of the GBU, Ritual, when it is necessary to expand the site, the builders will try to keep the existing woodfields as large as possible.
Green seeds will be a living fence that will divide rest areas and areas that are placed directly into burial sites.
The GBG's experts also stated their intention to make a proposal to give up the sanctuary at burials.
The new graveyards can indeed become unbridled.
In addition, at the GBU, Ritual reported on its willingness to host electronic terminals, which will allow depositors to know GPS coordinates and burial plate numbers.
In June this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So the growling graves in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the earth is frozen.
Note that in the past year, the cost of all ritual services has averaged 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the Elenne forests.
An elderly man lived, though he usually spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a fork.
A full-time effort by rescuers and volunteers has been made to heat up the grave.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retiree from Tambow Region has spent five days in the woods."
Without food and water.
He was looked for by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even films with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was exposed after the helicopter was engaged in search operations.
On that day, Vitaliininininavich was usually on his way to the woods to pick up her nuts and pick-ups, but he didn't come back by the evening.
The family immediately sought help, and the next day some 30 people were raised to find the fungus.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them on the fifth day.
And Andrew Seletkov, chief of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "Vertolett was attracted, the man was discovered."
He's gone far away, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometres away.
He passed a lot of distance at his age.
It's a miracle that's alive.
Grimbniks were taken to the Hellenic Central District Hospital without consciousness, in an extremely difficult condition.
Medical professionals diagnosed pneumonia as well as severe defiling and refrigerating.
How an elderly man could stay alive after five days in the forest, the doctors were completely unaware of it.
Valentine Nepsha, head of the Hellenic CIA therapeutic department, "A patient's examination, treatment."
Ifusic therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning, but he's still heavy, but with a positive dynamic.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovic comes to Smolenzina from Tambow region every year.
His grandson says that Grandpa was still picking mushrooms, but he never got far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of a fungus found, said, "Less not far from the road, not only is it not local."
I just came to visit my family for a few years.
Well, I followed the mushrooms.
I think I went a long way and got lost.
Since the start of the mushroom season, people have been regularly lost in all regions of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, five similar cases.
The rescuers remind us that you have to walk into the woods with bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that they can be returned.
An emergency Al-2 sat on a pro in a sisterly tig.
Right on the side of the village in Siberia, emergency Ann-2.
The emergency landing of the Red-Anisian airline aircraft took 68 kilometres from Braska.
There are no dead and injured, but the plane has suffered significant damage to the landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
He had three crew members on board, a commander, a second pilot and a driver, reports, Interfax.
The aircraft carried out flights along the Railwaysk-Ilymsk-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already arrived in Brask.
The office of the Minister of Transport, following an Al-2 emergency landing, began to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Public Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the TT-154 crew set up its aircraft with passengers due to the technical fault of the abandoned Taste Airport in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics were refused, but the crew did not.
On board were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured on an emergency landing.
:: Nobel laureate in the West Economics: globalization
The process of globalization should have been opened up to reduce the inequalities in the world.
In fact, the difference in incomes in developing economies is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to remedy this, there is a need to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the International Institute for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of INU VIE, the Nobel Prize for the Economy of 2007 Eric Maskin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The pro-globalists predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have happened in a lot," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a serious per capita growth in GDP.
Not all, however, are so happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “indigent” and “the poor” in poor countries, which was manifested in the high income inequality and, more precisely, in wages.
But this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economys,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the NEAP.
Together with economists, Professor Michael Kremer Eric Maskin of Harvard University, an alternative theory has been developed that demonstrates why income differentials in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, much like INE WEST.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to show them, Maskin provides four levels of expertise - A and B - for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, specialists D from poor countries lack the skills to work with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if workers in poor countries have increased their wages by cooperating with B employees from the rich, D growth workers do not feel that their wages are falling at all.
The result is that the internationalization of production will increase the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thereby increase inequality.
The Kremer and E. Maskinium have been proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative theory of comparative advantage.
It allows us to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alsketers, co-facilitator of the International Institute for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, Head of the Department of Maths of the INA.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this area.
The solution is, according to Eric Mackina, to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves do not have the resources to do so, and companies are uncomfortable with paying for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role in this situation.
The scientist notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produced results in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: life bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, notes his 2000th anniversary in September.
In the celebration programme, the Dagestan National Cultures Festival and a fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbent carpets and Open Temple Day, the historic and musical show “2000s in two hours” and the tour of the renovated Peter I museum.
The medieval stones of Narin-Kala anchorages, old Arab inscriptions on walls, narrow interiors and palace gardens, all seem to have fallen from the pages of 'Ten and one night'.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazara craganat, and the Golden Order were favored.
The age of the eastern plateau, which grows in the palace of the Juma Met, is equal to several centuries.
These strong plants are protected by the All-Russia Programme “Living Trees.”
The shadow of the scattered crown saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The mosque's visitor wears aromatic tea, and the daghistoin is made up of honey figs, furm, mushmulah, jadice, aran, and sweets.
In Derbente, the icons of the ages are used by large warlords to drink the teas of many guests at once.
The inscription on the entrance to the Jum-macheti says that the building was built in 115.
I mean, in 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is struck by the breadth and solemnity of the arcs of domes and sets, which are based on square columns and highlighted by the rays of the sun from the tiny windows.
The content and distribution of pigeons is a traditional attraction for the residents of Derbent.
The birds ’ owners place doves in the courtyards, under the trees, on the trunks.
A fascinating sight is the flight of white pigeons like the flashes of a holiday fireworks into the sky.
For the sake of defense against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
As you walk up to 500 feet [500 m] into the sea, this building blocked the wells of Derbent.
In 2003, Derbent's anchorages were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument to the ancient Freefixion.
The carpets in Derbente were still running in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the urban streets adjacent to the market, carpets are sold to any taste - beads of wool, cotton, or warships of all flowers and shades, with and without eye, with complex designs and a curious tack.
The city’s construction began with blocks with one - story stone structure.
Over the years, it has almost changed.
Only satellite plates, wall conditioners, and street lamps remind you that you are in today’s city, not in the medieval.
In the old part of the city, there were parts of a peach line built by Persians about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources have come in which the locals are now collecting water.
Many cranberries prefer water from taps from proven historical fountains.
In Derbente was one of the potter's tradesmen's centers.
The plumes and the chaffs, the dishes, the chaffs, and the cups were worth all over the Caucasus.
The hands of the potters are still producing remarkable design products, both practical and gift.
During festivals and festivals, crowds of spectators are gathered under a long canate, attended by students of the Republican Church Art School.
The history of amazing and risky skills has been endless.
A new trend is that girls are increasingly visible among Kanatorians.
The former Virgin's Bay now has a museum called "Culture and House of the Ancient Derbent."
There used to be a group of unmarried girls and bridesmaids accompanied by a friend, and now anyone who wants to see a shopping mall, a hot pool, and a cold pool.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but the baths and steamers are now as popular as they were in earlier times.
The benefits of heating are found in ancient books.
After the baths change blood, the muscles lose tiredness, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The “Commonwealth” festival, which is located in the Naren Kala strongholds, has been attended by ethnics from many regions of Daguestan.
The participants in the national suits dance, play folk tunes, sing songs of the Caucasus people, and entertain visitors with delicious domestic cheese.
The temple is the burial place of forty martyrs who have built their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the Northern Caucasus.
The yellow sarcophagus have been removed from whole stone blocks and are targeted, as the Arabs have accepted, in the west-east axis.
Brothers Gabriel and Albert Jakutov are stifling and taking customers in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
It's been here for years.
Cervical trades are handed over from generation to generation.
At the same time, Jacobov brothers can do not only a traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
In one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which the scribe writer Alexander Bestuve-Marlinski, who referred to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting the ethnic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life, and bull of citizens.
Chahana is a traditional Eastern club that provides only tea and domestic baking.
Men come here to drown their thirst, talk to their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in times past, women are not encouraged to cross the teatana threshold.
The Derbent Tansam of the Cape was created three years ago, but had already been able to participate in activities at the national and Russian levels.
The soloist of the Sansamba are being rehearsed every day by folk accidents, manganese, Thai, Armenian dances.
When the evening comes, when the noises and street lamps are lit, the locals sit on the benches of the homes with the terraces.
Debents usually discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly remembering the episode of their city's unique history, which has affected the fate of the whole Black Sea-Kapsia region.
Dodededeaux had a business "play at the airport."
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried as airport officers.
To that end, the three airlines were mounted in Domodedov.
Not only did young people inspect and register passengers but they also maintained planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it's not so real.
A late flight, two broken passengers on board, lost their way to the plane somewhere.
For this airport, hell.
For the reason that was established in the Dodeda hangar, the standard set of tasks to be undertaken by the newcomers.
In one hangar, three major airports were made from all over the world.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
It's an unprecedented chance to learn all about the internal world of aircraft.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage traffic - they even had buses in the flight field, stairs and searches of passengers.
And the passengers, they're in trouble.
One document disorder, another on a flight late, filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And we need to deal with all of this within a minimum period of time, as in life.
For each of these tasks, they are paid a certain amount, virtual cash, as if they were paid by airlines for the maintenance of the flight.
“They are fined for failure to perform the tasks,” explains the financial analyst Dmitri Hilco, in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitored.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of study.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
“The six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact become new models for modern colleges with a modern management system, highly skilled personnel with advanced equipment,” explains the Director of State Policy in the areas of labour training and additional vocational training for the Russian Federation, Natal Goldariev.
But students don't go to global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
However, the evaluation of the examination was well documented.
New sweets, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to our airport at Instagram," a pleasure player at the game, a pioneer manager of the Airport Frankfurt team, Sergey Schivalve.
The best judges, called, were taken to the pencil to be invited to work by the time they completed their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Center Foreign Literature Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Center at the M.I.Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“One-sided recent steps taken by the Russian Federation have called into question the Russian Government's commitment to links between Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult times in the long history of our country's relations”, states the statement by Ambassador John Tofft of the United States to Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and lasting links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, as well as the venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians and writers.
"Just last year, the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational events and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," emphasized a diplomat.
Tofft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX education exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchanges Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was under way.
A typical situation: Four officials are in front of Judge Swaster Kumar, listening to his claims for his work.
The court is totally not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to hang over it,” says Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we're going to have to take off all the construction that's available.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by a violent economic growth in recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had been able to examine more than 10,000 claims for air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the Court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: in the incomplete 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become one of the world ' s most populated and polluted countries of the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolis, where infrastructure development is not faster than rapid urbanization: cities are covered with heavy resources, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few of the remaining housing masses are being cut down under the construction of new residential blocks.
Despite formal support for the green movement by the State, the NZT has been regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the abolition of the largest investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment referred to the judgements of the Court as “extreme” and “inexcusable”.
It is sometimes impossible for the court to comply with the court ' s deadline, confirmed by environmental counsel Raj Pajwani.
However, the unimplemented densities are also positive: at least they make responsible persons move.
"It's the main goal of overthrowing this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large structures on several occasions: its airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities have ceased construction.
In the same way, people are being tried to keep in mind — for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagana State, which has polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," commented his decision to Kumar.
Such explanations, however, do not always find understanding with ordinary people, whose lives may change with the passing of a judge’s pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which resulted in public outrage.
Despite the dramatically declining popularity and criticism, Svaster Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of New Delhi to register on the vehicle entering and leaving, and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to learning about the factories whether they were able to perform such an order.
As ships began to see pollution sources, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, people's anger began to subside.
But the most painful theme of the principled judge was to clean up the Ganges River, with Pomp an anonymous Prime Minister Nandroy Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, which is sacred to the Hindus of the river, the judge often ceases to hold down his emotions and to cry.
You know what the word "sacred" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganga on the statue of God, and there were fecals in it, and the judge was angry.
You keep polluting the river because you think the Ganges is the Ganges, he'll take away all our sins.
It's the river that we worship, and see what you're doing to it every day.
The Ganga clean-up is the most ambitious and costly environmental project sponsored by the new Government.
At present, the number of fetal bacteria in the river exceeds 120 times.
Between 1.5 million and 3 out of 700 million Hindus bought there each year die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even contributed money to the Save Ganga Foundation from the sale of his suit, where he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists also accused the primer of popularism of buying a suit for $70,000, while at least eight billion is required to clean the river.
The Green Tribunal ' s supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that progress should be at the cost of environmental progress.
“In a developing country, environmental conversations are often perceived as unlawful luxury,” says Malik Bhanot, activist. -
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between environmental and development."
The man shed some blood on Daly's exhibition in Riga.
