Thank you in advance.

I know how to cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to have a drink.
In Ukraine, we have traditional beards, warlords, others.
I don’t have favorites, and I enjoy a variety of dishes in different countries.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I want to be busy.
The train is accurate, and no seats are available.
Sorry, but we're a little late.

Green: Mariopol — the heart of war, stop fighting — we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Greenski believes that fighting outside Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariopol, will determine the course of war – and if the UCU is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
The direct language is, "Maripal is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights--we fight, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have drawn a great deal of enemies.
The stronger our position in Maripolis, the stronger our position will be in the east of the State, in the EPA, and if they're stronger, the table will be closer to us and we'll have the advantages of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we are weak in all these ways, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all of these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we've now deposed.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation will be weaker and may not even be of interest to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, our victory.
The Green also said that it was difficult to negotiate after torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for diplomatic solutions if we have them."
The straightforward language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions of independence, Ukraine, but... every family has lost something... and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace under any circumstances.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims are, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust if nothing's gone, there's no people."

The Ministry of Defence ' s main intelligence office issued a list of Russian military personnel who participated in the war crimes attack in the Kyev region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported in Facebook by the Chief Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defence.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The U.S.D.O. has acquired a list of 64 military personnel from a single Moot Brigade that directly participates in the war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Boucha, which is reported.
GURU reported that all war criminals in Ukraine would be brought to justice and held accountable for crimes committed against the peaceful population.
You can view the list by reference.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpen, Bucha, Gostomel, and all the Kiev region were freed from Russian invaders.
Freed towns and villages have recorded mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city’s head, Bouchi, Anatoly Fedouk, reported that 280 people had been buried in the graves of the brothers.
On April 3, 410 bodies of civilians who had been killed were taken out from Russian invaders in the Kiev region.
On February 24, the Russian president of the russian country declared the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian invaders are being targeted and destroyed by key infrastructures, massive firing of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, firing systems, ballistic missiles, aerial bombs.

We were at the train station at the store.
Professionals offered. Is it possible to not know the language?
It's important, if there's a tradition like this, I need to know if I'm going to prepare it.
I thought in a week, but the situation is going to end up here.
Tomorrow might be a bad deal on the road.
I thank every person for his experience, even if he is painful.
I think I have learned from every situation to avoid repeating mistakes.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be a problem with that.
In the United States, many people celebrate this week in the same way.
This depends on religion.

We promised you that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It's great, I have money for two months of rent, and in Olmouka, the area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of atrocities committed by civilians north of Kiev.
The photos of the wounded and the shotmen confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?
I'm not surprised at all, it's exactly what I'm doing with sadness and waiting for...
I took the children and the elderly from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the slave girls with the children, and only then returned to work in the capital.
Since 2014, I have been consistently assisted by the U.S.A., and I have never doubted that my family would not be spared in the event of the occupation of Kiev.
Because I've been and I've been absolutely certain that the essence of the rotting Communist-DDR regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great grandfathers was shot in a prison in Gitomir.
A few years ago, the Jewish SBI was allowed to take a copy of the grandfather’s case — the one on the right side of a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution was very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "two-way" noble, never walked in closets.
The fact that they lived in fur and had a few cows was sufficient to punish a shepherd and a nursing child before his execution.
The relatives did not even know where the burial was located.
Grandma said that nearly a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's the name of Charlie's knockper in the picture.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if it's a relative of the KGB.
Apples fall from the apple near, as we know,...
The sharp three that sentenced the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
In analysing the case, a great variety of information resources were involved.
There's really great information resources, like the Death Bar, on Christmas without sarcas, which is a great reminder of what's going on in those years.
So, in today's race, the descendants of the CNVDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who has seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors between 70 and 80 years ago.
The people who found the mass graves of the victims of the steel mines and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found children's pornography files on the computer, they put her in jail, and she died there quickly.
The KGBists are now killing people who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why are you surprised at their actions now?
There is a concentration of the most disgusting traits of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed on the surface of the thousands of years of Orthodox tradition.
And then over what happened, you have an animal genetic experiment that carves the intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French "Cecist" film in 1992 and that's what happened.
Zo you saw my pictures in the bathtub.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry because I have no one to ask.
I wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went because Gala can't know them.
Do you think Igor asks you if it's convenient to drive tomorrow?
It's not so easy for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

Today's your coffee.
I've got my first "velosiped" after my son.
When do the girls come back from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we've been moved from the center to the town hall, and the conditions are good.
But there's a big one but there are men living like drinking alcohol and smoking in a room, loud music just the minimum thing that's "stupid", the smell of drunk men and we kids... scared to sleep if you're honest.
Please help me with the housing money.
But there's a safe place where you don't smoke.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so much, so they don't smoke right here.
I'm really asking you, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like.
I just pray if you can help me.
What matters is that we've come to understand each other.
Very positive, so beautiful, so nice.

Everyone follows the page at Facebook.
Trying to give you greetings and to say that they are very interested in reading the news.
People of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine were also mentioned.

There's a very slow turn on General Chapeka.
Everyone's got a chance.
The main thing is that love is genuine and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country, people marry for various reasons, most of which are selfish, meritocratic goals.
And I have a problem with that, if I don't love a man, I can't do anything.
Yes, we took the aunts home immediately.
She was very grateful, sobbing.
I told her about you and how you helped Ukrainians.
The tears were in her eyes.
I said if it could be some old blanket and a pillow.
I don't need that, just if it happens, I'm grateful to you too.
I feel sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had many questions about God, why there were situations in my life that simply caused me to get lost in everything.
And the little food stores are working, and I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a meeting.
We're looking for an hour and we're walking back.
Even now, I've been thinking about you, and you've written me.
Does your father have the ability to communicate Russian or any other family member?
You can get kids to go to Vala and play in the lobby.
All right, let's take the risk:
I'm glad I met you too.
At the place where Vladimir spoke to me, was he advised me to wait for me to find or look for the lady who lived with us here that we had to go to the subway station there's an institution to help find a house.
For a little bit, I'll cross the barrier.
Some questions I don't know.
It'll be good on Thursday if you can.
I can't call a doctor because I haven't done any food license tests yet.
But I can't call him because I ended up with the money.
I can't fill up my phone because I don't understand Czech online banking, and the Ukrainian bank map doesn't fit.
In addition, I can't change the tariff so I have normal phone calls and the Internet won't fill up the number.
I'm getting crazy.

According to the European Truth, Welt writes about this with links to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to a publication, the appropriate offer was sent to the German Economics Ministry on Saturday.
The value of 100 Howls, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also suggested in the APC Box for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to travel relatively close to the target of the enemy, Panzerhabütze 2000 can fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with a link to KMW supply, the supply of self-propelled Howbies is going along a circular pattern.
The Bundesver will, in the shortest terms, give Kiev 100 of its own Howls, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled with industry in the second phase.
The first new gouts may be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is that us on the morning or the afternoon together?
Thank you.

As I wish, all that officially connects us to him will be completed as soon as possible.
'Cause I don't think we're really good at this.
And even we've got a bit of a jab.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I didn't know Czech that well yet.
I must have thought of something.
Rightly they go to school so three because Gala and Status learn to graduate from school in Ukraine and get an opinion of completing in autumn they have to go to the university.
How do I get to the center of town?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide their own issues in their family, especially without the involvement of their family.
Can we be together?
It'll take some time before we're around.
Why don't we try this way yet?
I rented a car for nine people, and we'll come with Mariana and your family.

4. In 2022, refugees from war in Ukraine may seek humanitarian assistance at the new location of the Work Authority in the Prague Market.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to deliver and process requests for help, so there is a translator in the area.
Lydia's already in school, but we're going to the teacher's Tuesday, and I told you today.
I'm sitting there holding earphones, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy .
I don't know, love, how do you do?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say after the war there'll be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I'm not in any of them.
I don't know what's going to happen.
I need a food license examination, can I do that?
Please tell me tomorrow for five guests to cook the apartment.
Do I understand the fifth place in the room with the TV?
Untie and close the couch?
Can we stop here while Mrs. Margaret finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new ones you've used, but it's the job but it's not necessary....
Write the address in Czech, let's see where it's from.
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture this week wants to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what kind of furniture I need.
I'm sorry I've been answering that long, working day, having trouble adapting.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to be able to hug you.
To kiss you in the morning, to tell you what suits you.
The baby's already got a bed and a bathtub, the first time she found it.
Don't forget you promised to help me out when you're able, but don't last.
I want to make a strip called the cap
I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick and I'm tired of my cough.
Only I'm going to be a little bit later -- around 8. Can I?
I don't want any misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried it's okay!
Because we didn't even talk to these excars!
I understand how important that is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How do you feel today?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry I'm worried.
I was disappointed that Kolya and I had begun to translate the test badly last night.
I'll ask whether Gregory Denisenka or maybe Jonashek can help me with some help with mathematical ideas.
Maybe I could be something useful to them too?
If this is possible, I want to raise mathematical terms in the weekend.
The geometry is actually hard, but we have to work with Kolya without making mistakes.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We hope so too.
So she's very happy about any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech name
At the bus stop yesterday, I met Victoria, Ukraine.
This girl's a child, but she's here alone... with her eyes full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed we'd be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this little girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine who felt my heart connected.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to deliver and process requests for assistance
Turned out I ordered a spare card.
Don't, I'm just a human being.
Don't let her be scared that no one's ever gone.
I didn't walk, yes, it's me, it's the main thing you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center, Babin Jar, in Kiev, we honored 80 years of massive shooting by the German soldiers of the Ukrainian Jews at Babina Yaru.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of “the collective foundation of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial unity, peace and security in Europe.
This is also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, “then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: Never more!
The fight must go on."
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and made them die of disease.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually similar to shooting at Babian Yaru.
Over a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany has introduced sanctions, provided humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been imagined for so long.
Germany is diverting the heavy arms required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than speaking against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when we're ready.
All the sick only Lydia did not get sick with a new kind of caudada
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this ticket instead of a car.
Complain for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 guineas as a guide.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, the Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO's accession and only 18% of those surveyed were "for."
After the Gydnith Revolution, the escapes of Victor Yanuković, the anecsies of Krima and the beginning of the war of Donbas, the numbers of NATO’s opponents began to drop, and the adherents grew instead.
Since the beginning of the full - scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukraine’s citizens — over 75 percent.
Despite support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and NATO's assistance to war, there are now many criticisms about the Alliance and the member States – about the late supply of arms, the refusal to close the sky, and the reluctance to "invite" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation if it is able to stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the subsist, "The Real Questions" along with the editor of "European Truth", we are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO has to criticize, and why the Alliance has criticized in vain why our prospects of membership in NATO are closer than ever before, and why the security guarantees discussed at the victory with Russia can become a second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think it's here?
I have a partner in the Volts who notices that my application is under review.
I gave it to you through this mobile app.
We don't have a visa, we have to go to the convention center and learn how to do it, because it was formed in Poland, and it wasn't given visas, and there was a song.
We'll write you down!
We're going to Denise's in a good mood today.
I agreed with a young boy from Ukraine whom I met yesterday to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because that's how I don't like it, I don't need it for long.
In Ukraine it is reported that T-72 tanks and infantry fighting machines have been shipped to Ukraine
I'm leaving the kids I'm waiting there three to four years and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take you six to seven in the morning.
Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this person, but he did not act in a very decent way, and I left him.
After a while he returned and apologized for me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called out that he had a heart operation.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During that time, we enjoyed a lot of association.
At that time, I started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought maybe we really need to look at it differently.
He invited me to marry, and two days later he died.
So God decided on his own fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find accommodations, and I'm very happy to have a place to live and a place to be with my baby.
You had to remember me before?
) Because I helped to see children in my family.
Just write what I didn't understand.
I understand that the translator does not always correctly translate the text
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, do you think it should give me paper?
It must have been the guests who forgot, I put it in the closet.
Maybe you should go to bed to work tomorrow.
Or someone can help, you know, you need things for a woman that's XS size, or 165. And for her daughter. (8, 10, 12.)
I bought two packs in the ice, and my mom bought two.
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, give me something else, I'm still awake, I'm still dreaming of bombing...
God is never too late, everything is his time and place.
I don't think he wants me robbed:)
I'm perfectly aware of the cost of the unskilled work and I understand that the work I had at home in Kiev, I can't have here, and the money I earned at home, I'm not going to get here, too.
But just sitting there and doing nothing I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in the head go away, so you have to do some kind of physical thing.
The airport reports from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4: 00 a.m.
So we took them to us.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the Airport with them.
When you have it, write it and find out that...
I don't find any room anymore.
Sir, would you please invite Ukrainian kids to go to the gymnasium?
Yeah, but I'm making it hard.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.
I don't know how much work I'd like to have if I put kids in kindergarten and school.
We're planning this, is it better that we change changes sometimes?
I really don't have any missing Wednesday calls.
I suggest work, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing three windows, washing the dust.
I've been working for about three to four hours, the sum of 800 grannies at one time, from 19.04 p.m. to 14.00.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
I started coughing, and I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacist.
I'd like to ask for advice.
We've got Anna as the root species of Anja's name.
She passed the uncle out of the house.
Made an English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please.
On Monday and Wednesday, is it different?
Thank you very much, you're doing so much for our family!
Help is needed to stay in the pool
But that's my opinion.
My uncle gave her t-shirts and a catquesque, and she was riding at them at home, so that's what he's got.
I'm also up at 9:00 a.m., and I'm just about to have breakfast.
I'm very ashamed you're talking to me on your weekends, and I hope I'm not very shy.
We want to report the change in the apartment and submit the documents to continue the map
we're now providing medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you that tomorrow there'll be a bite.
One mother said that she was sleeping for kids of cook donuts.
He Comes to You
Please tell me, do you have an estimated cleaning schedule a month ahead of you, even though for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember any of this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to strike rockets against Kiev: they say, "I haven't done this before."
The direct language of Conashenkov is, "We see attempts at diversions and missions by the Ukrainian troops on objects in the Russian Federation.
If such incidents continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike the decision-making centres, including Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been held."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the early days of the full - scale invasion of the Russian occupying forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian rockets that hit the Ukrainian PPA system fell on a apartment building on the capital Posinium.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multistory on the Valery Lobnovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television station at Dorgoszczyk near Babia Yaru, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian SPA systems were shot down by Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence’s building at the southern railway station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the bombed missile destroyed the building and the trolebus on Courennic in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential mass on the Winogradar, where one person died, and another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles were destroyed by the modern retrovilla TTC on the Winogradar, killing at least 4 people.
On April 13, the capital, who had fled the city until it was too early to return, declared the mayor of Kieva Vitly Klitko.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still strike rockets at Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ammunition in the vicinity of the capital.
On April 12, the main intelligence office of the Ministry of Defence warned the Russians that they were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, an oilbasing explosion in Russia was launched by an air attack by Ukrainian helicoptermen.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Beelgorod claimed that “Ukraine’s projectile” had fallen near the city.
It is evident that the elites in Washington, D.C., and in Berlin, are throwing themselves into a cold sweat from the very idea that Nazi fighters would be shot down by Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But the Green guy isn't talking to them as much as he does with his voters and their societies in general.
By his speeches in Parliament and before the multicental crowds in Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors are inaccessible.
The Green won't convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he'll convince the European nations that those politicians are choosing.
And these talks, this sophisticated ally of strength, of emotion and of time of despair, gradually reach their goal.
As long as the same Baiden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the rapid introduction of Ukraine, this process is on the way.
I understand, so I don't want us to be fooled.
The baskets you collect are best given to the people who need more.
I can come to your place to help you.
But the air is clean, that plus ?
It says I have a two-way cut-off, and I asked the bastards to do the Internet.
I don't understand the tariff.
Do we have some other room today?
So I'm on my way, and I don't think you're a train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're all for me.
This loan is managed by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days to do that.
Who asked for the internet, could I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other.
Superintendently, I'm gonna be picked up by a man because he's got a car from that building company that he's working for today.
We are very happy and thankful that our Nick and our grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One needs to be cut into four parts
One of these particles can be used for two or three days, but every hour of swipe.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm very glad you're all right.
It is likely that at 4: 20 p.m., the concert will begin at 6: 00 p.m. and that I will be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet
So I'll make some tea and have some candy.
I'm going to go to school and I'm going to try and order Anny lunch for tomorrow.
But to go out on weekends in love.
Can we get there tomorrow, find out what's going on?
My name is Sasha, and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I'm a certified masquerade and nurse with 27 years of experience in neuroscience.
Promulgation, rehabilitation training room for children and adults.
I speak English, Russian, and Czech in an intensive way.
Contact: ---- and I'd like a letter so that Czechs can also write to you through a translator -- SMS doesn't go here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, but if they call, you won't agree.
You really don't want this piece?
He helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to do.
If you don't need a prosthetic, I'm not gonna set it up.
Tell yourself what you want, and I'll do it.
You didn't want to write to me tonight... for something.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
I'm just asking for attention today.
I want to say a lot today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You're going to buy that dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take it.
He's walking around for an old reality.
You call at work, find out if you're going to work today.
Children decide to leave home.
As long as something makes sense.
There's hope... that's not for long.
Now... it's gonna be... it's gonna be something.
Mosog refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket, everything we spent at home.
Many of us are the leaders, and our jobs are not paid.
Where do I go?
You can't take a lot of things.
You haven't taken anything out of your house, like, 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning till evening, you bring the children across Prague.
I don't know how much they're asking for sweets, and you can't.
And, of course, we don't have that kind of thing.
We have a choice: stay there and call the kids to safety, or try to escape here.
She was very happy with those heartmakers and the things she had given her children when she came to school.
I should have called me when you came.
I'll write it to you at dinner.
Yes, only in God do I believe and believe my life
I don't have the strength to do that anymore.
I thought you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and didn't have time to talk.
I've solved the menu, and I've ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing things with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what kind of species.
Please send a page with a visa or visa (red with date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libush, did you pay for that?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing so much good to us...
We owe you so much... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
I'll give you a picture of the lady's business, which I'm learning in English.
Well, you'll write tomorrow, meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning, we've got enough tools, so it's good to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want to, you can be with me after work.
Don't you want to meet me after 4:00 tomorrow?
What do you have in common from the first week?
Karina brought us a cure last night, and we drink them.
I can work with sick and disabled children
But I'm sure to point out that I'm only speaking Russian and Russian.
I don't have that.
May I offer you some soap for the laundry?
Because there's only a gel that's antibacterial.
I'm not sure, because I'm not very specific in town... white half 12
What services/actions do you think are necessary/ missing for older people?
I don't know because I haven't had any text from the bank yet, and I didn't take the bank cards yet, and the kids removed the bank statement with it, they upset me very much.
Then write me down, please, when you're going.
Today, we have the joy -- our town of Bucha was set free from the occupying forces, and our troops were gone.
There's an enemy cleaning -- looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, the clearance work is going to begin.
And John would see if there's something to be repaired or something else done.
I don't know.
Our Master wants to stay home, says he's tired of us, and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We're going to have corn and do lessons.
These were small entrepreneurs who, in their homes and shops, covered volunteer headquarters.
These are tractors that are actually going out in the field because it's time to sow.
They are bus drivers who agree today to travel in rubber stations on temporarily occupied areas to get help and take people away from them.
They are heroic leaders who, without fear, go to a war zone, comfort and help refugees in cars, and at peaceful stations, help volunteers load a humanitarian into their cars.
These were the autocrats who stood on the Gitomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and anxious people.
They are the Communists who take away garbage at gunpoint, repair water lines and power lines in order to provide people with the necessities of life.
They are doctors and nurses who, 24 hours a day, save lives without complaining, and in the free minute, they are still busy collecting tapes on the front.
We're in Ukraine, and we're running out of juice when the little ones are leafy.
What do you say, little kids, what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is this age acceptable?
I'm looking for an apartment for my daughter and me three to four days to come to Czech Republic and send out passports to complete my visa in Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the visa center who don't work on line.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a long road train, it's gonna be hard for a kid.
So I decided to find a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
The Paradoxious Devices Where to Bring
But I can't change my password when I go to the link because I get the following error:
It's in the microwave, something burned out there.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks always communicate with customers 24 hours a day and all questions are resolved quickly :)
Nothing, get used to new realities.
I don't really like it, and I want you to know it.
You can edit the post.
Yeah, it's full of it.
We've already arranged refrigerators for some Czech boys at 1: 00 p.m. to help move.
I want to come to you and hug you and kiss you.
at 7: 30 a.m. I read the story of world theatres to actors, filmmakers and theatres
Last night I'm evaluating the objects after dinner.
The scurvy is still asleep, and at night I cried very much, and the tooth is coming down.
I'm on the phone with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people have died.
Chechaia began to issue visas after March 22, after me.
By then they had put images like this and then compared them to visas.
Ukraine's foreign electorate district (BOT Ukraine) is the elective district that unites the polling stations located outside Ukraine and consists of voting rooms in the embassies and Consulate offices of Ukraine and military bases abroad,[voice 1] where Ukrainian peacekeepers (Coloco and DRC) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral Region is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign election district, only national votes are held: the election of the President and the People’s Deputies and the entire Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in the VVO.
They're at the station near the mother's and the baby's room.
She says she doesn't know where to go anymore.
Are you angry with me?
I'm going to remove the photo in the bathtub.
I don't need any money anymore. I got a long-term loan from a friend.
I wanted to say that I had already connected the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2 and they made me an email SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you, I'm really uncomfortable, Sunday works, and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine, take it for yourself.
We don't have enough blankets, hook blankets, plates, kids don't have pajamas, and there's nothing to get in.
Good morning, I'll be out at 10... write the address here missing
I don't want to torture you, not myself, I'm going to beat it in myself.
So it would be good, but I know there were no places, and they actually have all the planning lessons now and they teach pretty well.
Do you have a meat cut to make paint?
Good for you after the Easter.
Did your mom say you were hurt by something last night?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and doesn't understand what they're talking about.
Today, too, I went to school.
Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very good apples, what's in class?
President Andre Jermack's head reported that Russia is beginning a "fee surgery" on the arms that allies are handing over to us.
There's a direct saying, "They realize they're losing the war, seeing their backwardness, and trying to break up the supply of arms by any means.
For example, one of the last of the fairies is that there's a lot of destruction that Slovakia has passed on to the C-300.
That information has already been refuted by Prime Edward Heger.
What's going to happen, we know the script of the Russians, and I'll call one of them.
They may start a fairy tale that Ukrainian soldiers of the Shire surrender to arms from allied forces, and they are turning massively into armed Russian forces.
I want to warn you of these fairies right away.
Because a weapon in the hands of the ZAS soldiers is the only one who sends the enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you how much money it would cost for a garden in a month, and would it work in summer?
Everyone is given in power.
There are much more sadr stories, believe me.
So I had to survive to change.
It is written in Tora, and God created in man a wicked start so that during the course of his life he would change spiritually, become better
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want.
How this lady would be found in a social clinic tomorrow before the hospital was ready to visit the town.
He listened to his mother and didn't come with us.
I know you've had a hard time.
And I'll do everything I can to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you mean it seriously.
I've been watching the announcement quite busy. Now it's hard for us to do that.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole question.
You haven't had a call today for a change in mobile operator tariff?
I'm sorry, but I can't hope for anyone in this life.
Today, I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I've made it work already.
Thank you for responding, and I wish you could find a good helper.
Perhaps your father told me that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However, baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all the faiths, the foundation of which is love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, I started reading Toru.
I think there are no mediators between man and God.
You might also think about not putting the refrigerator at the door of the boys' room.
Thank you very much.
We're looking for a dichotomy to clean a house here in the village.
Proposal 150 crown/year. Other cooperation with them. Date agree with Mrs.
I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about how we talk to you.
But we can just look at each other's jokes.
I went alone to my mother, and there my sister and my friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked them to go.
Where's the good barber?
Good afternoon Viktor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this gentleman with documents to pay for the drapery and said that with the bank furniture so far there's no furniture there.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
We have good doctors here, too.
We've been cooking at home, and we can't find the keys from the attic.
I'll take the laundry to the fifth guest, and the pillow and the extras are in the apartment?
But as you get in touch with the owners, you don't have contact, and you need a long-term shelter, we work and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of each description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use these online translations from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.
I don't care, we're four on the same bed in a room where I don't even have to, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on those links that I sent you above?
Each of them has a free housing offer, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find contact only enamel, but I don't have anything to do in my apartment closer to Chesky Krumlov, we have a job in Chemlovov and now we're living in Prague.
I'm not going to help you.
Thank you for your help, we found our apartment, but we need a bed, and maybe the couch will tell us where we can buy a budget that's not expensive because our budget is weak, thank you very much.
Can't you tell me that you're not eating well and that you can't eat too much in the morning?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm a curator of the National Pedagogical University of Dragomanov.
I'll be happy to cooperate.
Meanwhile, Russia has set up its missile complexs at the Finnish border.
They want to try not only Ukrainian penis but also Finnish.
I'll be the happiest when I'm with you.
When I wake up next to you.
I kiss you and say, "Good morning, dear, you look very beautiful."
Where can you buy a moving hat with your ears?
It's a lot of work today.
We're not holding you back?
You don't have to take credit, do you?
It's enough what you're talking about, and I want to understand you.
Let me see and tell her
But it's good that you're good, otherwise you can't be!
She's lying on her bed, Sakka's stealing balls for her in the kitchen, maybe the mood will go up.
It's a very heavy toast, and it's on top of the eye.
It says there's a request for humanitarian assistance.
The application must be filled in with the CR office.
And show that bar code.
That is, I made an online request, but I need to go to the Work Authority.
I'm planning Monday.
I bought a phone number.
It's a day that I miss very much my Swimmer.
The video is coming back tomorrow?

We cleaned up the whole room and we moved to the second room.
The international community continues to express shock and indignation at evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as “provoking”.
“According to dead, raped and seriously injured by the Russian forces, the Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation”, declared Jassinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Rosa must answer the world for what they have done,” she added, adding that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kisida, called the incidents “a violation of international law”.
The statements were made after reports were made that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into sisterly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bouchi by Russian troops who left the area after occupation for a few weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with tied hands, shocked many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution against the guilty.
On April 4, the President of France, Emmanuel McCron, stated in a radio interview that there was evidence that Russian forces had committed “war crimes” in Bouchi.
“The thing that happened in Bouchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear actions, ” McCron said, adding that additional arrangements should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, said that Russian troops could go so far as to do the genocide in Bouchi.
“We will do all we can to ensure that those who commit these war crimes do not remain summary,” said Sánchez in Madrid.
On public television late on April 3, Maria Zaharov, a reader of the IMS of Russia, rejected the charges as “provoking”.
Without evidence, she claimed that the United States and NATO had ordered images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the production of these materials does not give rise to any doubt about the person who made the story," said Zechariah.
Previously, Russia’s Minoborants also claimed without evidence that the Bouchi image was “one of the rulings of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian forces had left the city until March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “encourage of Ukrainian radicals” in Bouchi.
On April 4, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring “persecuting” the charge of spreading “knowingly false information” about the actions of the Russian forces in Bush.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greeni, came out on April 3rd, accused the Russian forces in the town of Genocide, and told Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Bouchi to see what their troops had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being followed,” said the Green in a video rendition, passing from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shot at the back of the head," he said.
He claimed that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian military should be responsible for the military operations in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their hands and beheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bush, about 35 miles [35 km] northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a Ukrainian police correspondent, Rado Freedom, saw a civilian on the streets of a small city of the body.
In just one place, a correspondent saw up to ten bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw bodies of at least 21 people in different locations of the Bush.
The bodies of one group of nine -- all in civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a very close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kiev area, which had been controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
And they said, "There's no Kiev." As the Ocupants took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item about which there is now much less information — the removal of the local population into enemy territory.
About mid-March, Russian ocupupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements in their territory and in the area of Belarus, which President Lukashenko had declared in effect handed over to the Russian military unit.
"The Ukrainian Truth" sought out Ukrainians and their relatives to inquire about how the same "evacuation" happens and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after that.
Heroes of this text have been placed on voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from inadvertentness.
Fortunately, they're alive, and they're in contact with their families.
In view of Ukrainian authorities, however, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of another maternity house, took the children away without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of a dead champion in Ukraine from the voyage of Joseph Zachpinski.
Alexander's family, Marini, and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Gostemel a few months before the war.
Alexander was just getting his job at Anton Airport, which is about five miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although civilian.
As true plastics, Denise and Marina collected disturbing suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24 they failed to evacuate.
They didn't have their car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24th, they saw helicopters with a Latin V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 persons were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came in and talked neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They say, "Who are you?" I say yes.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was a gun.
All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the army.
The women said, "We've come to protect you at Ramsan Kadwiya's order."
It was a Czech MOON, not even an army, of young boys 25-35 years.
They said, "From us in the war, the Ukrainians, the Sasko White (commanding the UNA-UPO-Ving movement, which was fighting on the side of the Czechs in the first Russian-Cheensian war, UP), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was missing.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the shop, they took the goods out under the drive "The Russians Will Take", and they brought us six bottles.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank Cadilla for the food.
So they brought the cowboys in after the robbery and they said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmadović."
No one really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to give away our phones," they laughed.
They were also constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said, well, they came, because they didn't want the wars, the Ukrainians are also good at saying, "Putin is a bastard, Cadley, too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mostly they didn't fight, but they used to rob shops, they used to loot them.
The hens were taken, one was tied to one leg by a georgian strip, the other by its own white cattle, and called it "the filler."
They have come to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Bouchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they said, "You have any artillery?"
Moreover, we had built - up troops — the chaffs among us did not know, in the early days, asking for passwords to reveal whether they were their own or not.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian MOON arrived, followed by the Omsman.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours were constantly coming into it from the Bieracs.
But these came and told us that the CSO is gone, but there's Azov, and they say, "Azov" is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
And by the time of March, "Kiaw had already surrendered", he was waking up.
One day a Russian came to visit us — either an officer in a deanth, or a representative of the FSB — saying that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- there was a Buchu, Gostomel -- thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the beginning, we handed out our lists, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus and then maybe to the Growth."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
They said, "Know your children's mental health!"
How it worked is that they pushed us into the basement and started shooting us from under the house -- or "Grads" or the minimites.
And then it came back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland, "We're being shot, they're sold to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road, there was a burning, broken technique, although whiterus told us that Russian technicians were being removed immediately before them.
A lot of capionaries, buried machines and soldiers.
At the White point of the Comar pass, we went through improvised control, and many were without documents because they were burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots shooting a rocket, and you can see it's Iskander working on Kiev.
Although these white-roofed Red Cross said, "Oh, no, these planes are flying, they're going back to the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand that.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the Chenkie sanatorium near Gomel.
His boss came, Wenger Vasil Stenavovic, and he says, "Here, I am, I'm, I'm, Chernihova.
But I understand that Putin and Lukaschenk will not stop until those thieves of yours beat.
Poor people suffer!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say, as he has said, so it will be."
They were offered interviews with white-collar journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were known as) were spreading the disinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had him on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian Consulate, we were not helped at all, but in the Minsk station, we were told that without passports, no one would be taken to the bus.
I'll tell you that we've been greatly assisted by the white-collar volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and we were executed.
The sanatorium wasn't held by force.
Our second migration representative said you could spend a week or a half here because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an inside transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we pass near Mozziah, about 50 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border — UP — we saw ballistic missiles launched in Ukraine: the rocket first comes out, shines beautifully, and then comes out.
The people who were on the bus in Mozira told me that the Russians were always shooting at the police.
But I can tell you, whiterus don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she'd break something to her son if they called him.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, doesn't believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They don't think their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
Friends who had taken us to Estonia were waiting in Poland.
Now we're going to register, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia the Ukrainian flags are now probably the same as the Estonian flag."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with his brother's family -- his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to gather the most important things and documents.
During the evening, they went to the basement to sleep next door.
Marina's own home couldn't go back, and basically she couldn't -- there's no house anymore.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you go to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything.
Thank you for making arrangements, the bedsteads are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, it doesn't catch a wiff, it's mostly for all your questions I don't know now what to be? And kids from Monday classes are online, and the Internet isn't.
So I'm going to live with two women with Ukraine and their children, is that a family ready to accept us?

Can I have a deal?
On April 1, the city’s head, Anatoly Fedouk, announced a joyful message — the Ukrainian military on March 31, released the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupations were expelled from all over the province of Kiev.
However, the joy that would have been felt by the Ukrainians at that time was blotting out the horrors and hatreds, since at the same time it was known that at least 280 civilians were killed by Russians alone.
They were killed on the street right now, and some were tied up with hands and shot in the back, part of those killed are minors.
The dead and the following tortures were found by the village of Motigin Olgu Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and her son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23th.
Olga and Alexander’s bodies were in a brother’s grave, Igorah in sewerage.
On either side of the May 20 miles from Kiev, the bodies of several divorced women trapped in a blanket were revealed.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there's nobody at home.
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
I had to deliver her yesterday, but no contact was available, and the parcel was not delivered, and on DHL's website it was said that the receiver could not be found.
So the parcel was sent to the mail and the address of the office is specified.
How can I take it?

She's very contemptible and somewhat inappropriate.
Then she'll stop, she'll forget, or she won't take her phone right now, and she didn't tell me that she was at school and that everything was okay.
And I'm worried about her because she's not at home, she's in another, not quite familiar state.

I've been talking to you very often, and I think you can hear my thoughts.
President Vladimir Greenski stated that some of the weapons given by Western partners were too late.
He spoke about it in an interview with Asociated Press, which he published by the President's Office, writing "European Truth."
"All the equipment they've been sending, for some types of equipment, it's done too late.
So what if we're talking, for example, about Mariopol, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said the Green.
And the question is, it got enough of Ukraine's weapons to make the difference in the war, and the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, that war would not have been, or it would have looked different.
"It would have turned differently; we would have had the shoulders of our neighbors; we could fight together.
But I'm sure wars wouldn't be,' he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoured weapons and counter-correstrial weapons.
My dream that the war ended and returned home

Grumpy's already gone to the lawn, but it's not that simple... it's very heavy crying.
Today, a new girl from Ukraine called out in a garden.
I didn't even touch the door, and she's calling.
If I understood Mr. Director correctly, he said that if I worked in a garden, I could come to work for as many hours as I could.
If that is the case, then I will be able, for example, to work a few days a week.

He was a very rich man, and after a while he telephoned and informed him that he had had a heart operation.
Asked me to talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I could be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he offered me a suggestion.
"I had a car in my yard like a crocodile, and I would drop the hail.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, breathing nothing.
And what about the housing that you took the picture.
I'm not really there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this festival.
The last two videos I'll see when the normal internet works.
At work, is there a rush, or is there anything that we can walk into?
All right, he'll come in there and pick them up.
I'm not greedy for everything.
I know I can't sit in your room. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1 + 1 and it's actually Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidentist, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police and the ambulance were coming?
Diane didn't answer me, and you did.
All right, I just need to do is print pictures to kids, so it'll be okay, when can I come?
But you may need a more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm going to make sure you're satisfied with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but learns in Czechia, a tourist industry.
You really don't want to come here for a minute with your kids and your grandma.
I want you to come with me, wake up with you.
In general, it is difficult to get around in a foreign land, and every day it makes me want to go home.
Mrs. Agata, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make us live here as best we can.
I remember you for life.
And I'll remember and smile.
So thank you so much for Ana's still route to the phone to get us faster.
I have to pay the fare, I have to control it.

"I tell her TV and radio scans are prolonged through the import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to be seen when they call."
"For a whole month, we hide from our mother-in-law the war.
For now, it's done.
But in Plammka, the punge and the back paws are filled with fur -- it can be stress, a change in measles, and a shortage of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, and that's not how stress depends on me. I'm sorry.
The balloon, unlike its mother-in-law, is not deaf, hearing the sirens and the explosions."
Because Olga is deaf and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter - in - law lived in an apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93, Oxan Polov, for the first time in his life, took up arms.
"33 days I've lived with her like a partisan.
There was a war that was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there was always a few hours' formal visit.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her my receiver -- she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
Radio receiver was always at the bed.
Most of the time, she spends her mother - in - law in her room.
It doesn't feel good. It lets me be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid a receiver and a TV.
Then she called everyone who was talking to her, and they were 6-7 people.
Asked to talk to her about anything but war.
I'm gonna ask my friend, she's been there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17 -- I'm cleaning up two apartments:)
Good evening, I never thought about it one day.
Hi, if tomorrow needs more help, we can come.
Should I ask you if you can take lunch from your house?
I'm offering a cut of male, female, childish, coming to you, all of those interested, please write in a personal message, the price of:
I understand and I don't complain, but in my situation, I'll be looking here for you.

The British who in the VAS fought for Mariopol said he was ready to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer of the Ukrainian Air Force Marine Force, who is involved in the defence of Mariapol, told his friends and families that they would lay down weapons and surrender to Russian occupations.
Source: twitter-story Adin Aislin, a British man who has served in the VMS ranks since 2018, an Air Force with links to Asslyn family members and friends, Atlas News with a reference to the words of a friend of Asslyn who talked to him
It's like, "We've got a message from him, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariopol, but we don't have a choice, except for being taken captive to Russian forces.
We don't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end."
Detectives: Aslin served in the 36th special naval infantry brigade of the ZSO, which participates in the defence operation of Mariopol.
The U.S. military journalists contacted the mother of the guard, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son had informed her that they were planning to surrender.
A second military officer, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that Eislin had told them about plans for their surrender unit.
He said that the crew ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists at Atlas News contacted his friend who said that Eislyn's unit was going to be taken captive to Russia's subunits so as not to get out of arms and bullets to the hands of the so-called "ships."
Social institutions have also distributed audio recordings of a telephone conversation that is allegedly spoken to a familiar American friend who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British used to say that he was threatened at Instagram by representatives of a private military company called Vaggner.
Eislyn was a social worker in Newark-on-Trant, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017, he went to fight the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the VAS and sworn.
Eislin's friends and close friends called Johnny, and in social settings, he's more known under the mystery of the Cosack Gundie.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find it...
You offered to come with you, I agreed if it was okay.
Thank you so much, you and I have done so much for us, we thank you so much.
If you ever want to write to me, I'll wait.
Hey, Natalie, please put the flowers outside at the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech as well.
I'd like you to have a little rest and think about yourself.
Today, you're sure to use a face cream.
Yeah... thank you so much. I didn't even think I was going to be a man like you, health and luck!
Little Douglas isn't ashamed anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to our door.

I'll do everything for you.
How can I prove it to my lover?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it to you.
Perhaps you have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy.

My family's good, and I'm left with my mother, my three brothers, and my husband.
A brother for the War in Mariopolis, a friend in Zaporozhye, and a man from Kiev today was transferred to Harkov.
Every day they say everything's okay, and whoever knows it, they're not gonna tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to get to you, but I wanted to do some work.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll make it tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, please, I should have been in touch with Daniel.
Major attackers for their war losses played a full part.
The teacher, Dmittra Pavlici, was shot by a relative unknown to him, young Boris Alexander.
Their bodies are thrown into “a pit that was covered with the earth”.
After the memories, "There was some dead silence in the city."
Some of the residents ran from house to house with fire.
In the streets there were always bodies of bullied Bolsheviks
Maybe I'll really go after you, but I need you.
3. What is your own activity/action that would help you or your friends to better adapt to life in Czechia?
But you won't, because there's a reconstruction of the railway and the exit is closed.
Come to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you've come and I'll come to see you.
The Best Future for Us
Lena, the stuff we didn't get in size, give you if you could give Katy.

Well, we're going to try and take us to the social services on Tuesdays.
Then, when the filling is cool, the dough will come, the sticky pies will burn, and they will burn on a little fire on oil.
Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we get together tomorrow night, I'll get him on Tuesday.
I want me to be able to repay all those who helped us because it was the last hope, the truth.
I'm not afraid of robots, as I've lived in the village, so I can work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition. We're going like this for Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council passed a law on 7,176 entitled “To monitor the potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy”.
Strangely, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy has been... the location behind which the members of the oversight council of the police department and the poles meet.
The lawmakers believe that decision making by the board of the court in conditional Kiev can somehow solve national security problems in Ukraine.
We are aware of a great number of new dangers to the police, but no company is known to be in need of physical supervision at the location.
The potential threat from such a law has been understood as a great basis for bringing down all the gains in the difficult reform of the responsibilities after the Gydnty Revolution, including the independent oversight council, and then setting up a manual management system.
The year before 2015.
Why should those in charge have oversight, and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if under the patriotic slogans one harmful legislation is taken off, others can fly tomorrow -- for example, a system of state procurement through the ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Many things can be written down to war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war and the law.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of legislation 5397.
In general, the desire to corrupt oversight counsel in one way or another has been a long time since.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but for the purpose of showing the possible consequences of the law, we will consider the arguments that have been used to explain the need for its adoption.
And then we're going to make suggestions on how to resolve the issue of managing the entrepreneurship of war.
The first deputy minister, Denise Kudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for the remote operation of the oversight board.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory council will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may be paralyzing the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is, but can it be prevented from moving members of the oversight council to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where independent board members (most of the warehouses) put their personal security ahead of the company’s interests and refused to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they can be released by law.
And then, most likely, it's going to lead to the loss of the quorum that you need to watch the advice to make any decisions.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the oversight council, since the law predicts the need for competitive selection, which takes an average of three to four months.
Hence, the decision proposed by the law, 7,176, is likely not to be able to protect from loss of control by the Council’s ability to make decisions but, rather, to do so!
The People's Deputies, the author of the Dimitre Natalha Act, gives other reasons for his support.
In particular, he says, "Many enterprises, such as the defence and industry complex (PKK), need to be renovated now," and that's why it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensational information."
For starters, Ukraine has little or no PLOs, which have advice.
The oversight board is only in the Trans-Corborandem, which basically manages almost all the responsibilities of the PLO.
But even in UPC, in accordance with the legislation, the supervisory board has limited powers, and all of its members perform duties not without charge.
The full power of the Ucrobornro is vested in the Director-General, who, by the way, will decide on the need for a reposition of an OCC company that is part of the concession.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand up to criticism because the law has not changed at all in any way the legislation governing the PLO's responsibilities.
Mr. Demetrius, on his Facebook page, also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
These arguments generally have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the pre-eminent and thorax work, but let's try to figure out some of them: "the important foreign experts at the first word war" are leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory board in Ukrainian State enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is really going to suffer war."
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine, and they just came here periodically.
So to say they're "let go of Ukraine," it's not fair, to say the least.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long resorted to online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and in very different fields: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
It's also worth remembering that membership in the watch board is not a full-time job.
They tend to have a different kind of activity, and that's how electronic communication helps them to do it.
Third, all of these claims are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why did Mr. Demetrius not make identical claims to members of Ukrainian oversight councils?
Because they're not at the site of their companies either.
In fact, this is not the first popular effort to remove foreigners from the board of oversight, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for options for a temporary shelter in my family, with two kids.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In Brovarsky, Vishgorodsk, and Buchanan regions of the Kiev region, which have been released from the occupations, they will introduce a high curfew for two days.
The direct language of Pavluka: “In the inhabited places of Brovarsky, Vishgorodsk, and Bouchansk district, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, the curfew was increased!
And there will be restrictions on these cities from 9:00 on April 2 to April 5.
Details: According to the head, traffic and walking are strictly forbidden on the streets of towns and other public places.
Residents can only walk outside during an alarm signal to turn to cover.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the effects of Russian aggression — to clear and clear areas.
The Omelinak called on the people who had left these areas to stay away from their return.
In the rest of the Province, the curfew will last from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. every day.
No school receipts have been sent to me yet.

The Serbian Defense Budget grew in geometric progress for several years.
In the last six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the upgrading of military equipment, and the acquisition of modern systems, raising 22 seats on the world’s most powerful military powers.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries have taken seriously the prediction of a possible increase in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukraine conflict is complicated and globalized.

Other frequent questions about driving rights:
I have a driving license in Ukraine, can I control it in Czechia?
However, if you are in Czechia for more than one year, you must trade it in the municipal service on Czech driving licenses.
• The driver’s license sequence ended, what could be done about it?
• The term that ended after 1.1.2022 remains real.
• The term of action ended to 1.1.2022 - is invalid, and you have to test,
I have a real Ukrainian driver's license, and I want to trade it for Czech:
• stay in Czechia for at least 185 days in the calendar year.
• It may be replaced in a municipal setting according to where it is located.
I don't have a real driver's license, and I want Czech:
• The completion of a school course, a car - control test, is required.
Ask us for a test procedure.

Lucashka's regimemen have been detained by three whites for 27 and 28 years, who have been involved in the destruction of two rudders of a signal machine under Osiopović, which provides train traffic.
Source: Radojo Swaboda, the law enforcement centre of the UIF, Gennady Kazakevic, the head of the criminal police, quoted as BELTA.
In the U.S.A., Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three people from Bobroysk were detained and one of them was injured because of the force of the SBI specials.
According to the News, when the men were delayed, they were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees has been wounded and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the ground.
The U.S. Chief of Criminal Police in Belarus Gennady Kazakevic stated that “the terrorist attacks on the RB railway will be severely stopped” by weapons fighters.
On April 6, it was reported that on 30 March, the police detained another White-Rail employee, a co-worker of the Baranowsk section BJC, and BJ's topical resource administrator at Vkonaktie and Linders' Hospitals in Valentina Samazka.
Where it is and where it is not known, reports @belzd_liive.
By the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for the disversion.
Remember: The BYpol formation, declared by the regime of Lukashenko is extremist, continues to call for whiterus before the revolutions on the railway and Belarus's infrastructure under the Peramgo plan.
Belarus's "wish partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that because of Belarus, the Russian Federation is about to drop off to fight, living power and technology in Ukraine.

U.S. bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against the daughters of Putin
The United States, along with G7 and the European Union, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of President R.F. Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and the Saberbank, and has banned all new investments in Russia.
This is in a report on the White House website.
Saberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their U.S. financial assets and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a total ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Baiden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decisions of over 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms," which is the bill of the White House.
The third step in the U.S. sanctions was the restrictions on large Russian state enterprises in the critical sphere.
It will ban U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freezing any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
Minffin's detailed list will publish the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the children of the full-times of Putin, the wives and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmittry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishust.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

You can call a school, Kira doesn't pick up a phone, don't answer, I don't know if she's gone to school.
They isolate the Russian office, stop the investment and stop the supply.
But we didn't understand.
The army did not dwell in our home.
Our home is near the military and the oil department.
He just helped me because I wouldn't do it myself.
I cook, I don't ask for anything, and I give good advice
I give it to myself.
I have a little bit of a problem, but I realize I have to go through this phase.
I'll meet you on Thursday, and I'll tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
How often you're cleaning up.
I clean every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Desired to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard about housing, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a house with some decent girl.
If you can know such things, let me know.
I will not, for my part, fail.
Thank you too long.
I haven't written you another person, Natalie, for 54 years.
I think it's best for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name, it's one since I was born:)
Good afternoon, Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I didn't see, I'll do it right now, and I'll send it to you right away.
We're gonna go to the medics right now.
I mean, I'm gonna need Ania to spend this hour working on another day.
On what day would it be better for her to come sooner?
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet isn't working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... found something out of things, but there wasn't any technique...
Both beginnings, except for vows, know nothing.
Nothing's happening.
May I be on Monday, 25.04?
Children can be taken, toys are enough:)
I thought about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm going to come up with something with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how this is going to be paid, please, no credit.
Write me that straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes we gave?
- Today is not my day. It's been a close break in the living room.
Something came from you, I don't see.
I'm also very sad.
I'll remind you of the fact later.
Do you only have Dad talking and understanding Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do to clean up the house, and how many windows do he have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your work
Good evening, I can't share with you, and there's a message from Mario for a son alive and in line.
I'd like to read Joe Dyspenzza, and he's researching the impact of external factors and forming new connections neurons.
"1+1" Journalist Natalia Nagorna published on the morning of April 12, a video that was broadcast to her by the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade in Mario.
They say that they have no arms left to take part in the fighting, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that the count was going for an hour.
Prior to this, on April 11, 36th, a separate marine infantry brigade, who participates in the defence of Mariopol, published a Russian address to the Ukrainians.
It was said that on April 11 might be the last battle for the defenses of Mario, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the men for two weeks.
Sceps was said to have been published in Russian in social settings.
In particular, the Ukrainian Commander of the Armed Forces, Valeri Zalc, assured that the forces of defence in Mariupolis were connected and that details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the territory of the Azstal plant in Mariopolis and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian Occupants dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopol.
According to Andre Billzka's leader, the RF's army has used chemical weapons over the Azstal factory, which keeps the Az.
Thank you, I'll fit under you.
The situation is the same as we're staying here.
( ) Travel, mom, shopping, and back!
It's not an important thing.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The escarrily of the Czech dorons has since started flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copiers will serve for detection, and some will serve for the direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpatians and two Czech “birds” brothers were sent to Ukraine in the early hours of the day, thanks to the deputy of the Mukkaev City of Vladimir Labutenko.
For today, their Hungarian friends, led by the head of the settlement council and coordinator, have been delivered to Mr. Vasil Schuur for appointment: they have received special units of the Ukrainian forces in various cities where fighting is taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of the copiers, where they are located, we will leave the mines at this moment.
Four of the friends who help the Ukrainian army from Czech Republic to stop the situation say that there will be many more interesting “gifts” that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes in the days ahead.
Don't worry, it's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
Soon I'm going back to Ukraine and I'm going to keep working.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try it myself, but if I get a break, I'll write it down if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Yiviv, and she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy, and she'll feel better.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm frozen on the street today.
I've had drugs and tea, I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd better see you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, leave me the music you like.
I don't care how much music you've got.
Mom and Dad need to be obedient
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's lap.
It's been cooler here today, and it's raining, it's got to be warm tomorrow.
But it's no pity for the broken houses, the pity of the people who've been mistreated.
At Herson, the Occupiers were confused with the Clothra of the "Glava of Ukraine" in Kherson on the street of Persopsky.
Details: The unknowns are said to have cut off the flag of the European Union, to have broken up panels with photos of the sky hundreds and dead in the Russian-Ukraine war.
The Okupants have swept up the portraits of the heavenly heroes and the dead Russian - Ukrainian war participants.
They took the flag.
Good morning, thank the kids for the ride, we don't have that custom because we didn't know that, gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else to give them.
There's someone out there to talk to, if anything.
Because I'm living like a dorm do twelve people will be here and then go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been in a tree tonight.
Even today, I've slept there.
Thus, we have made great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the crows to another time!
Today I have no power to do them.
Since I am distracted from the days and times that are spent cleaning the apartment after guests, I can say about a month on April because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May, I can say roughly at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked me if you had something to say about it....
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't done a long meal and slept a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet again after you come.
He's a humble, he's been learning a lot lately.
(Laughter) It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such high office.
Today, a little lesson has been learned from a lady who is the director of an economic department of the country of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
I had a bad day in the flesh.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for meats.
I'm out of Friday.
I don't just do a lot of things to them, and I'm sleeping with them. (and I drink a lot of water ?)
If I go to a doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I've got to get another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's really bad working out a bloke, it's getting bad, I need a master, I need you to fix it.
That's enough.
Can you send me a valid e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to attend the Czech language course you enrolled in.
Do children eat there or have to be brought with them?
Now, for a moment, there's one question to come to you.
If You Need Help Write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, right?
From the very beginning, we didn’t really want you to raise money so that people wouldn’t think that we were grafting on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have two options:
I'm going to go to rest, get strength and energy, thank you for today's gift.
I'll see what's good about this video, because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Karadis urges workers and students to examine carefully any information, not to trust anonymous sources in Mengers and social networks, rumors and gossipes.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who has remained in Ukraine, has also helped the army
I've collected a couple of jobs for the portfolio.
After a party, they have to spend the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm gonna have a day that I wasn't at work is a labor break.
Staffing: Russia prepares provocations in Pristina to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state”.
It says, "The Russian Federation's armed forces are not excluded from acts of provocation in the territory of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring State."
Detectives: The enemy continues to create the next group of troops for action in the Slobojane direction.
Perhaps in the next few days, the ocupants will try to restore the attack.
The enemy also continues to train and send special warehouses, weapons, and equipment to participate in fighting activities in Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the 60th separate shooting brigade (Monestrish) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
Likely, the marked armament will be transferred to the temporary occupied area of Donetsk.
Also, in order to restore the loss of the special warehouse of the Battalion tactical unit of 36 separate Moot Brigades (Borzia, Zabaykal Krai) 29 general military forces in the Eastern Military District are being deployed by a number of military officers from the Police Command.
The enemy feels a particular problem when he's taking up driver's office and having a mechanian driver's office.
The departure of the selected special warehouse from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Probably the enemy to break freight supply to combat sites will continue to hit transport infrastructure sites in Ukraine in order to destroy them or destroy them.
Certain members of the armed forces of Belarus continue to carry out tasks aimed at strengthening the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Russian and Gomel regions.
In the Slobojan direction, individual divisions of the 6th General Army and North Navy Coast Guards continue to block the city of Harkova in part, hold artillery fire on separate areas of the city.
In the direction of Izumum, there is an air search of the Ukraine Armed Forces position.
The enemy is using the Orlan-10 BPLA to do that.
With the force of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to strike in the direction of the Long and Demetrek villages, his success was unsuccessful, and he had gone back to his former positions.
In the Done, the enemy continues to focus his efforts on taking control of the cities of Pospasna, Rubzing, Lower, and Novobakmutka, as well as the full control of the city of Mariupal.
The enemy tried to storm the Golden Area, and he did not succeed.
In the city of Maripal, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occult continues to storm around the Azstal plant and the seaport of the sea.
In the force of individual units, the enemy fired artillery gunfires at Ukrainian military positions in areas inhabited by Vískokul, Trudobowic and Mariana.
In the Donetsk and Lugan region, Ukraine’s supporters of a mine-to-day era have shot four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six car equipment units and eight enemy artillery systems.
You don't understand what you're thinking?
We're sure we're gonna make it, but I doubt it.
How could you want to sleep and I'll hold you back?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see tonight, so tell me, I'll get it.
Thank you, we didn't look at the TV at home, and we don't have to set up one plus one.
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm running a monthly tariff package today:)
Can we do it on the phone tonight?
Buy fabrics for embossing, cannails, and emboss
I see, I can prepare material in this area.
I'm going to ask her, and I'm a little ashamed to ask, and she gives us a lot of pies.
I'll meet my father later, sure.
I've read the show in the Fessbub, maybe Google has written something in it. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Good day, we've got the things you brought, but there's some things you can bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director sets up, I can start going to work from the next week because tomorrow before lunch, I plan to go to the labor office to file documents (if I get it because I'm a very big queue) and Saturday rain:)
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, I love chemistry at school, I'm learning Czech, to know perfectly, the dream of working in Tevi.
Friends of old and not so much, friends I don't know personally, friends of the spirit and of the mind.
Now you too have experienced difficult times.
During the last month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from one foot to the other, just like every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feelings of guilt and shame over your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is doing on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Chercasov, my very old friend from "Memorial."
I'll tell you a little later, – Sasha, as usual, said concisely.
Others — cultural leaders, artists, critics, writers — are struck by the sudden fall of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memoryal, in the New Gazette, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Madges, the organization of Naviv, and in a bunch of other places -- have many of you ever done anything to resist this regime?
Except for meeting attendance, when they were still there.
Read also a column of Russian journalist, "Sonno, it's too late to be quiet."
And if you do, you're sure that your sense of shame and guilt isn't just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long - term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive fellowship, which must now be a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
There was a short period in the 1990s when you had some freedom and democracy -- messy, even bloody, but real.
But the 1991s didn't prove better than the 1917s.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, do you eventually have such a strong fear of sorrow that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he's killed, you still feel safer around him.
Yes, mistakes were made.
Instead of taking over and publishing the CGB archives, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the Dzorzynski Memorial – and let the KGB lie down, wake up, change, and take control over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between country's robbery and Communist return, you didn't fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallyings for great social justice or against war in Chechnya.
Survival became a major concern.
Then Putin appeared, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but you have voted for it anyway or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you closed your eyes.
I remember well those years.
And I was working in Chechnya right then, helping the victims of the Putinian anti-territoric operation, and with my own eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar Jurty, Itum Cal, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends, I went back to Moscow, and I had fun hanging out with you guys, my friends.
We were drinking, dancing, and sometimes I was trying to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed about the torture of civilians, about the killing of children, about the soldiers who sold bodies to their families that had been killed.
You said to me, "Bless, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I was going to say, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid alien here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic climb of the middle of the zero, caused by rising oil prices and ready Putin's to see through his fingers that part of the stolen money would remain in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - made, some have become wealthy, and even the poorest have bought new housing and have found better jobs.
The prices grew, but isn't there trouble?
Moscow was holyly lighted and linteled from the neck.
When several opposition guards were killed — Yuri Szkochivin, Anne Policowsky, Alexander Lithuania, and others — many of you were shocked and shocked about what was going on.
However, the matter still didn’t go.
When, after two terms, Putin passed President Medvedev's office, and you're sitting at the Prime Minister's seat, I see you've barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of the Medvedier Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or gave up.
How many of you have I met in the years to come on the mountains of Hudauuri, in the foothills of Kazbezi or in the cafe and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it's unlikely that we've done a lot in the West if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a little bit of sanctions; but what's the point of Russia breaking international law when there's so much temptation in Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the heavy 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011 you, my Russian friends, were still awake.
When Putin again traded with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went mass to protest.
Navalov's name became biased, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt terrible that it was losing the ground under your feet.
After that, he struck back.
At first alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and the prison was filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some have received tremendous terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I can hear it so far.
"The State is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Inflamed by the pro - Russian president, who deceived their European expectations, they captured Meidan once — and never left him again.
They built the tent town on their own and prepared themselves for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, amorts, and Molotov cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protestors went to attack.
Many died, but they won.
He became Janukovich, and the Ukrainians restored democracy, the right to choose their own leaders, and expel them if they did not do well.
Madane did not like Putin very much.
This was a bad example.
So when he took advantage of his general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you have been opposed, but few benefits.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the anexia.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you, who despised Putin and his jack, suddenly returned 180 degrees and loved it.
I find it difficult to find a reason, since we stopped talking immediately.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you went to books, movies, ICEA catalogs and parks, away from as new after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their binabies, the public vefo and the hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, weren't there?
EDI or whatever -- even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, unveiled it then in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and myself saw state Snipers shooting cold blood in my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers were there, who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015 with experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with what Pastor Martin Nimeller said:
"Finally they came for socialists, but I said, 'cause I'm not a socialist.'
Then they came to the labor unions, but I said, 'Cause I'm not a union member.'
Then they came to the Jews, but I said, ‘ I’m not a Jew. ’
Then they came for me, but no one left to say anything for my protection."
How many of you have talked about Czechs, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some really speak now -- like Demetr Gluchowski, Mikhail Schishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maximus, and others.
Most people allow themselves to talk from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Osalnonkov, to risk getting into the new GULAS or building up a company called the Nails.
In the case of others, you know best what kind of country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin is dealt with by the Ukrainians - or, it seems, it's very likely, if he doesn't, that he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone, they went to protest, and so far there was a little term, but soon they'll get a bigger one.
Thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreements in social settings (even with a black square in Instography) or spoke in private discussions with colleagues at work.
At times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty was simply an anecdote, they were not in that distant past -- and now, with great likelihood, they are waiting for you in the future.
Who, then, will speak for you, who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians -- even more than 2014 -- is frightening to the Putinian regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that the mind, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage is.
In view of everything, few in Russia realize it, as well as the fact that war is going on at all.
But you guys know exactly what's going on.
You're reading web news abroad, you've got friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're connected to.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in return for your silence came to an end.
Your election is just a homma, your laws, if you don't take into account the repressive, are worth no more than the paper they've written on, your last free media no longer, your economy is ruining faster than I'm writing, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there's no flight left.
Now Putin is not satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you'll see something else.
Yet, there is another one left.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe under conditions you're going to need less of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that settles in Russia, it will most likely be burned up in the province, in small cities.
When prices are gone and wages are not paid, those who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people a lot more than he fears intellectuals and middle class Moscow and St. Petersburg, so you guys are my friends.
But if every city comes out in a meeting itself, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination are needed. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet, which can restrict the regime, but it still works, and it can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalov's organization was broken, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If there's more than 300,000 out there, it's going to be shocked.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all he forced them into Ukraine, what made them pass?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master who dare not only to demand freedom but who are really trying to obtain it.
But even if you do not, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will end a joke in the chatter of a computer game – and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and he will die in a Syrian cell under police clubs.
This is what has been happening for many years — and it will continue to grow ever more and more.
So you don't have a choice; if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to end.
Act cold blood, think strategicly, and make it a reality.
We were on Friday for class, they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night.
What You See Me as a Press Secretary
How often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
Once a stream I go to dinner at a expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
That's how we liked it, and we wanted something closer, so that's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people, and I was tired of energy.
I feel bad, I'm coughing, the temperature, the voice, the weakness, and the head spin.
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done that, but they said who registered in April the money was only at the end of the month.
Thursday needs a break, and we go to a doctor with our children.
But at night one lady wrote me, who liked your job, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting on her for new news, and I'm sure I'll tell her.
While working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was totally disappointed.
It's a terrible loss of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I’m a social person, but I’m not alone in the matter of marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, having a heart problem.
I think that to create a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
So far, I haven't met that.
Good morning, where can you get the uniforms in the lynx to drink the papa (a paper or silica)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'll now introduce a witness to Valu in the questionnaire.
She's got the DCP in the back condition, she's got now a leg broken in the plaster, the wheelchair in the back of her head, the food all goes through the blender.
Mr. Reihard, I'm sorry I'm bothering you in a bad time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into Natalie’s play room today, say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to look at the things and lay them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valeri opened our baby room until 19 a.m. yesterday.
Can that really be so?
The working hours of the room are up to 4:00 p.m.
Finally, it is our responsibility.
But I don't have to go through a page that's very weak on the Internet.
Good day, we've got Coke working, we've filled out the invitations yesterday, and I've been dealing with the older men before the exam at the gymnasium.
It's the most important thing to think about when it comes to geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Vicki is a student of universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the flat and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We're going to have to maximize the amount by the end of the week to figure out what's going on.
The Russian invasion situation is a briefing by the adviser to President Ofisa Olesia Arestovic (10.04.2022).
The President's adviser to the Chief of Office told us about the heroic action of the senior border officer in Mariopol -- he was surrounded and injured, so he blew himself up with the radio station so that she wouldn't get the enemy.
I have a very important question, or will help me count my grandson to her for five years (armoured asthma) now, she's got a scumbag and a chip...
We need a family doctor to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice is urgently needed.
We're living in Chechaa Dolnií Chabry. I need a doctor who's about to be here in the Dolnií Chabry, or somewhere near maybe Brno but not far from the subway, so we can get to.
The exhibition of butterflies was a pleasure.
They would sit on their hands and feet.
