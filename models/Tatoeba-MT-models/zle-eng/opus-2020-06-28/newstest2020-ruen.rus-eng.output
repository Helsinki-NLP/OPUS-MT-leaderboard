TikTok hides bad videos from users
TikTok estimated that its users worldwide are more than 500 million, 40 per cent under the age of 18 years.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok is subject to censorship of videos that mention the Tiananman area, the independence of Tibet, or the banned religious group of Falunjong, says The Guardian.
Documents that appeared in the publication indicate that the owner of TikTok (BiteDance) with an annex advanced the objectives of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations of China's policy are described as “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok contains inappropriate publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the social network does not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls within the general prohibition of “screaming or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The prohibition of incidents in Tiananmen Square or the Cambodia genocide is a “dealing of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of 20 foreign leaders or public figures, including Kim Jong Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Jong Yin, Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Tramp and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kin Hee, Indonesian President Joko Vido and Indian Prime Nandra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Title 1 publications are removed by social administrators and may lead to user lockups.
Not too strict are the second category: such publications remain on the site, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
BiteDance's representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable, "We are now using a localized approach and attract independent local professionals for the design."
Russia's TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, explains Rustham Bogdanov's co-founder of the Preservation Centre.
"Producer Center" is one Russian media company that formally cooperates with TikTok.
All bloggers' blogging materials of the Producer Centre are in agreement with members of the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement, and they are being sent to Bogdanov.
To the question whether TikTok could comment on politics or Putin, Bogdanov responded positively and said that he had seen such publications.
With Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the Or Didital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: there is no shocking content, discriminatory speech, and so on."
But under these rules, the content of any kind that does not like the controllers can be summed up by Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
TikTok estimates that its users worldwide are more than 500 million, 40 per cent under the age of 18 years.
The user agreement is that TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
The socialists test their age through artificial intelligence: neuroscientism analyzes individuals and determines how old they look, explains Goddanov.
If neuroscientists decide that the user is younger, his account may be removed, he adds.
According to the RBC, in September 2019, BeteDance opened an office in Moscow in the territory of WWork.

Barcelona blackmails Neimar
The Spanish Barcelon and her former football player, Neymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the French attacker Pari Saint-Jerman.
The case almost came to trial, but the Catholics offered the player a solution without Femida.
Otherwise they refuse him back.
Nemar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had an interesting focus: an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he had to get Euro40 million.
However, in just one year's time, it was in the PJP for a record Euro22 million.
Nevertheless, he had received 22 million from the Catalans, and now he wants to pick up the remaining 18 million.
Little by little, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes it interest to him for a portion of the payment.
When the capital of Catalonia became aware of Neimar's claims, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Cyrenades insist that they relied on the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that the player was only one quarter of the 40 million euros and requires a proportional portion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Nymar and Barsa almost agreed on the return of the "bad" player to Catalonia's bosom.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope of a return route remains.
So, according to Sports. Ru, with reference to the Inns, the lawyers of the club told the players that, if the issue of financial claims were not settled in advance, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Nemar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would ransom him.

The theme of phytodrogen is not well understood.
The most famous is pine dust.

Hydrometcentris name true folk mittens
There are many people in Russia who will accept what people are trying to predict.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre, they checked all the receivers that were said to work.
Methologists have concluded that only two can truly be trusted, yes, in the short term.
As the scientific leader of the Russian Hydrometre Centre, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be a feast, just as our ancestors have noticed.
And if the sky is bright, it will rain on the next day.
The second worker is based on bird surveillance.

Undetected oil stains were found on the beaches north-east of Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
Pollution risks were spread over two thousand miles [2,000 km] along the coast.
The reports of the first oil stains discovered began on the second day of September.
However, their number continued to increase from day to day up to Thursday, as well as territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out that they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the State Oil Corporation of Petrobrous, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it was stated that they did not correspond to oil obtained from deposits in Brazil.
"It's dense oil.
It may be dropped from one of the ships after treatment of the reservoirs.
Many continue to do so.
And it's probably in the ocean phase," he told the Brazilian news portal G1 of the oil union coordinator of Pernambuco and Parabiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to throw waste on the high seas.
Four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country had discovered nine sea turtles covered with oil.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin the treatment of contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute recommends that tourists and local residents visit the oil stains and warn of all the contamination found.

In addition, Mr. Medvedev instructed all those agencies, in addition to Minusta, to submit proposals for a monitoring exercise for organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatar and Kaliningrad province, effective 1 January 2020.
Minusto and Minami are mandated to submit to the Government by 11 November, as amended by CAP, an administrative suspension for violations of the requirements for the organization of food, which resulted in damage to health.
In addition, Minsk, the economy, Raznadzor and Mindina need to work on a gradual transition from 2021 to a consumer basket based on a basic set of products to form a complete diet of healthy nutrition.

There's no way for Russians to retire, V. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to enable the country to complete the bill on the guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing the pension from personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely it is.
“In my view, a large proportion of the population now have incomes, of which they simply have nothing to contribute to the increase of pensions in the future,” said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the Speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and assessment of the pension, since “the permanent changes in this area have been completely confused”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“The Republic is a social State, and we must do everything we can to ensure that pension levels are improved by the social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible for domestic realities,” said W. Matvienko, “RIA News”.
The head of the SF stressed that, if the initiative (the law on the guaranteed pension product) was to develop, there must be a number of basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for safeguarding pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the departure of a bill on the guaranteeing pension product (SPG).
Among its main elements is the voluntary procedure for citizens joining the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings by the State, registration of citizens ' accumulated accounts by the central administrator, business tax incentives and tax deductions for citizens.

But that wasn't good for Sony.
The news about the possible departure of a favorite superhero from Quetzal Marvel caused anger from many loyal worshipers.
The details of the new conditions have not yet been released.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have been very cooperative for the last four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans [The human-pacue].
We're glad we can go forward together."

A team of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that more than 10 billion microplastics are caught in a five-minute tea bag.
Irrigated drinks can also add a particle of opium to the package, said National News expert on food safety Elizabeth Tishonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer is unable to obtain reliable information on the composition of the packed tea - the producer may add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
They don't throw the oil at the end of the season, so they might be in the tea.
"The worst thing is, the packets don't always include the tea plants," said Tishonov.
She said that it would be better to avoid using such a drink in favor of tea on the margins sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of a mixture of tea was not only a composition but also a method of production, that micro-participants were heated to high temperatures, which could cause them to start allocating harmful substances.
“The best thing to buy is pure green or black tea, which will have the least additions,” said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
On 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Economic Policy Committee, Andrei Kutepov, became known as the “Paralament newspaper”, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreckin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, inviting him to express his position on the initiatives taken by the constituents of the Federation to improve legislation on support for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SMEs).
Time to develop interregional links
The Federation Economic Policy Council Committee summarized regional information on their own business development and legalization programmes, as well as the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions briefed the senators on the development of SMEs and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“So far, communication between regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes across the country,” said Andrey Kutep.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in regions for the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and challenges (to be edited).
In addition to the substantive ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also distributed to the heads of the regional executive branch.
Exchange of information on successful regional employment could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, said the Senator's Paper.
Good Experiences
Small and medium-sized business support programmes have been adopted and successfully implemented in many regions of the country.

The Amur district under the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing the business incubators established through existing non-State colqing centres from the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support measures for youth entrepreneurship have been introduced.
Self-employed continue to be driven from the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangel region proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business” because it “is more closely consistent with the content of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivan region, it is deemed necessary to amend the expansion of the list of activities of self-employed citizens, including the separation and repair of accommodations, construction days and physical training.
Brensky is of the view that it is important to strengthen the control of the unfavoured dairy producers through the Mercury veterinary system.
In Costrom and Magadask, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and support for social entrepreneurship is promoted in the regulatory and legal fields.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be the development of specific bills.
“All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be the development in the form of specific bills”, assured André Kutep.

The sales of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, the supply of agricultural produce and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin in 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries, up to 3 million 442,000 tons in a similar period in 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of imported products has decreased to $226.5 million, to $975.5 million, respectively.
These are supplies that are not covered by the embargo.
As indicated in the report, imports from CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia have been compensated for having lost the volume of prohibited imports.
Recall that at the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the duration of the rules for the destruction of agricultural produce, raw materials and food, which were prohibited from entering Russia in the framework of counter-counselling.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules were extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The destruction order was originally applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, as of 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the list.
The decree on the destruction of illegal “sanction” imported to the country, which was signed by Putina, (products under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to anti-Russian sanctions by the West), entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government allowed the destruction of “sanctional” food by any legitimate means.
As the sanctions of the West continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.

Chile began building a 1 billion Euro telescope
The TSS reports this to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
The construction of a dome of an E-ELT telescope was officially launched this week, according to EEO, (European Extra-Sciential Laree Telescope - European Super-Brop Telescope) while the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project was under way.
Its total value, estimated at ESO, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the construction of the Observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 30 feet [39 m] in diameter.
It will be collected from 798 six-go segments of 1.4 metres.
It is a huge mirror, as well as two subsidiary surface surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, which will help E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and seek the Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this Observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.
Although the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observation of scientists, engineers and others have been developing for three years since the opening of the first E-ELT construction plans.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of around 400 million euros, was awarded by the German firm SCHATT and the French company Safran Resc.
