Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The international group of biologists has concluded that the most long-lived vertebrate is the Greenlandn polar shark, which can live about 500 years, is passing RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystalline eye of 28 Greenland’s sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that the importance of the shark’s long - term long - term role is low, which leads to slow development.
The females of the Greenlandic shark reach puberty only by 150 years.
It was previously thought that the shark’s “symbol ” is the Greenlandese whale.
The oldest person, known to scientists, was just over 210 years old.

Should you go to a sanatorium if you don't have any health problems?
Our expert is Olga Bosch, the chief physician of the sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just getting tired of his job, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanitary rest is essential not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
A person can check the condition of his or her body and get a doctor’s advice on how to live so that his health is not ruined.
Such recommendations would not be unnecessary.
"Just getting tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it's not worth slamming out of it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Some 90 per cent of those coming are experiencing stress.
The most vulnerable people in cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to make things worse and let them rest on time.
Research shows that 98% of people are reducing their biological age while in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatories offer comfort for the entire family.
So if you want to have a vacation with your children, you don't have to give them up.
Children, even the smallest, have health programs that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums are children's basins), inhalation, special diets, massages, oxygen cocktails, and medical exercise.
The course of procedure shall be determined by a doctor in the light of the individual testimony and the characteristics of a growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, and various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for visitors to infants, provide the necessary facilities and services to an experienced nurse.
A mild winter, a long summer, over 300 days of sunlight a year creates good conditions for round-the-clock rest at the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs more than rest in summer.
So there's no need to fear the weather behind the window, especially since most of the procedures are held in a room and are completely independent of the season.
In general, sanatorium and oral treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for mature people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, treatment mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essintuka, Narzanne.
The water has unique properties and impacts on different systems of the organism.
Water varies by temperature, quantity of salt, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's feelings.
Narzan, for example, has an anti-inclamatory, immunodynamic effect, reinventing the stomach-to-cycle function and sharing of substances.
Esstuka4 affects the stomach-to-cycle tract, reducing the level of sugar.
The "Estuary's New" is an anti-inflammatory, yellow-hot and urea action.
The same effect also holds the water “Salvative”.
When water is assigned, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there's hypertension signs, it picks up less salty water, because salts slow down the liquid, causing pressure to increase.
Mineral water acceptance requires treatment: water should be taken for a certain period of time, at the right quantity and specific temperature.
Various cosmetological procedures for individuals and bodies are now available in the sanatorium.
What type of recovery based on the natural features of the Northern Caucasus is available at the resorts of the region?
Near Fivegorsk, for example, is the salty Lake Tambukan, which has a catch of mud for joints, spines, and internal organs.
It produces anti-sustenration, dissuasive, immunosing effect.
It's a healthy walk on the individual-made routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Kurt Park, second in size in Europe.
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the Narzan mineral source.
You can also take baths of wine, pearly, yovoloma, salen, sappy-lacular, depending on what a doctor will give you.
Let's continue to bear fruit.
What can you do to make the harvest work until the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopouchov, aglon, and a daughter.
It's time for high-quality tomatos to pick up new pastures, cut off the poppy, remove all the leaves until the last brushes with fruit and sweetness with small bonds, they can't dream.
All the toma, regardless of the "Constitution", and the peppers and bilges, are fed with launder-supplies, biopropremist (Davrelator for the acceleration of the oil and growth of the fruit, Fitosporn-M, Fitolliv, Hamir, Batkuphyt for disease, Immunocyctophyte for the promotion of immunity, Betoxiblitin, Lepiducid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper domes, colloid sulphur and green soap are worth chemicals at the end of the summer.
We're doing the last water of plants.
The long - winged reeds in the heat are allowed to be seen in such a way that the lower, nude part of the stalk (25 - 40 cm) falls to the ground, water heat and solution of the Circon, and deposit the stalk with a compass of 5 to 7 cm.
It is also easy to spread the fruit of a cane by cutting down old leaves, watering warm water, and disposing of integrated fertilizers, and spreading the fertile soil beneath the bush.
To protect yourself from the cold of night, establish an arc with covered material.
On the day of the plant, keep the sun open and close it after sunset.
Markings of the end.
What indicates that Russia is out of crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts surveyed, the GDP of the FF shows positive momentum - in the second quarter of GDP, it fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This is the minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to his latest data, Russia’s decline in the second quarter of the economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
The front is slow growth.
According to the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The Russian GDP index is saying that the recession is behind and the economy is slowly growing ahead," says the Bank of Russia Bulletin, "What the trends say."
The benchmark GDP for the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter estimate is 0.5 per cent.
The representative of the Ministry of Economic Development reported that during the second quarter of the RF GDP had stopped in the second quarter, accounting for 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally refined GDP fell to 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter of April, it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, the change in GDP was within 0-0.15, quoting the representative of the IREA News.
The slowdown in Russian economic decline over the last five blocks indicates that “the two has been passed”.
Other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery include increased demand for electricity and rail transport, and business recovery.
If you adjust that the year is high, it is understandable that the trend in plus 1% of electricity consumption may be caused by an additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BRECK.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month of last year.
Moreover, for the past two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia declined for the first time in five years.
Looking at the rate of rouble, which, while showing a strong variation at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that real economic performance should follow,” emphasizes Jacovenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in international trade from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May is slow.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also demonstrates positive momentum.
It was only below September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of real incomes in the population remains a better one.
In annual terms, the figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This may impede economic recovery, as household expenditure is a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia ' s strong policy is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
There is also a lack of investment, which hinders industrial capacity development.
But, in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the growth rate of the Russian Federation will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015” says the analyst of the SC Forex Club, Irin Rhowa.
The naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well lived in winter sports at the Olympic Olympics in Sochi, has not been developed so actively in summer sports.
If the Rio Olympic Games are for Russia and foreign ex-nationals speak of, most of the country's constituents of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
However, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process — a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality varies.
Some parents were taken to another country when they were young, leaving no choice.
Someone didn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian assembly.
Someone thought that there would be better conditions for development in sports abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl in a German passport says her name is Lisa Riga.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Only four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to immigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go in the footsteps of her older sister to take a light athlete.
Like my sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
She's staying in Russia, and she's hardly going to be able to "up the throne" to Ellen Issbyev.
Unfortunately, in the Olympics of Rio Lisa, there will be only one of our townsmen, albeit former, in the Gaza Strip.
Its best achievements in this sport were the European championship bronze of 2010 and the continental silver of 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Issibaev.
A 29-year-old Elena Pirozhkov was born in Novocsetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious preachers of the gospel.
A few, because of their faith, they left in the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Helena, there were eight more children in the family.
All of them lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena's starting to get involved in the fight at school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where the U.S. training centre continued her studies under the leadership of another former Russianman, Vladimir Imbakover.
In the London Olympics of 2012, Elena lost her first match.
But the championship of the world was winning that same year.
Before that, she had succeeded in winning silver at the 2010 world summit.
This was followed by a 2013 bronze and a 2014 silver.
26-year-old Maria was born in Jaroslavla, where she first met the synchronist voyage.
But to say that she was raised by our trainers in Russia, it would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to immigrate in the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her classes.
Soon she was in the United States assembly and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronouss cannot compete, but for America its indicators are ceilings.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldabin received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching girls artistic hypnosis outside the ocean.
Until then, the girl had been a favorite sport in the family of Jaroslavl.
After immigrating to the United States, she quickly entered this country's young assembly and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Christine won the gold and silver.
She had certainly not fought for the first positions on the world scene, but for the United States, she had organized a real breakthrough -- she had launched a Star-Polosto Pedagogian set-up on the Rio Games.
Another of our ex-boyfriends is Jan Marezko-Margender, who is in favour of Germany's collection.
She was born in Tolett.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for entering the national assembly.
Soon she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is true that she has been able to occupy only 17 places that are not sufficient to enter the final competition in her personal firstborn.
But two years earlier she had managed to win a bronze medal of the Olympic Games, a young man.
Another gymnast, only this time sportsman, Irina Sazonov.
If the ways of emigrating the former athletes are standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusable - Iceland.
Ira is a student of Volgograd Sports School.
In Iceland, of course, she was the country's championship.
True, Ira is trained in Russia, but he is making special trips to his family to avoid losing his skill.
In Rio, she did not act as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in the private camp.
There is very little reported to be the plough of Maria Ugkalova in Russian information space.
Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she has been under the Russian flag, showing good results - it has even been a record of the country at a distance of 200 metres.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began to act under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best address was 14th in the complex estaphete 4x100.
To get to the game, a girl started a tapending project, which was able to collect some 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for the Olympics' preparations.
Adam Buttvi, a 31-year-old military fighter, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hassavourta’s brother-in-law was able to become a three-fold prizer of champions of Europe, a champion of Russia’s World Class sport.
When he stopped entering our national assembly, it was time to think of a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports posts.
Triumph return took place at the 2016 Asian championship, the Battrov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and obtained a ride on the Olympics to Rio.
Another ex-Comisan, Michael Deanova, is even less aware of the Swiss singer Maria Ugolkov.
The point is, his parents immigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to do sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, its best result was 40th in the qualifications of parallel beams.
But for New Zealand, even getting on Olympic Games in sports hypnosis is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her exercise in synchronous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at a European championship in Berlin, the girl took the sixth seat in the synchrony.
In a duet with Eugenia Thetelbauum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was the fifth in the salon program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Kroyter is in favour of Israel ' s prefabricated campaign.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
During 2009, Dimitry became a champion of the country at the age of 17.
That same year, he won the world's youth championship.
A year later, Kroiter won the gold of a young Olympic game in Singapore.
In addition to high-level jockeys, Demetrius works for long and three-way pick-ups.
31-year-old Albert is another member of Hasavurta, who, after a long statement for Russia, decided to change his sports nationality.
Unlike Bativar, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia he spoke for the Krasnoyarsk High Sports School, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the home as a player of the USSR ' s prefabricated group at Jaroslav Antonov volleyball.
Just one year before the birth of his son, Jaroslav was recognized as the best volleyballist on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The same family continued to live permanently.
In 2015, he became a national team bronze prizer of the European championship held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hajiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got along with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to immigrate.
Norway was the original objective, but it was not possible to reach that northern country, having to travel to France, to Nice.
Zelimhan continued to learn the war effort.
Soon he won the primacy of peace among young men and later qualified for participation in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he would be the only representative of France in the struggle.
Again, free struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time, the North Ossetian woman who had immigrated to Spain was Timuraz Frywe.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012 and is currently in favour of a team of Spanish citizens.
Before that, it was true that a 30-year-old athlete had seen great results in Russia as well.
He was a bronze prizer for the 2007 and 2008 championships of the country.
The Charter of non-contribution, Taimuraz, decided to change sports nationality.
Our last list is a Czech boxer, born in 1995 in the capital city of Dagestana Mahakkale, Arthur Bijlarslans.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on his older brother’s advice, began to do boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Bírjanslaws won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first of its new home since 1975.

Why do kids of fairy classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "they need to be trained, not by actions and parades, but by systems."
They must grow and at least from 7 years of age realize that they are fairy tales and education.
But so far this work seems to me to be going on in a formal way, and I suspect more on paper.
If the casino classes take all the positive that has been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be pleased.
If everything is in the air and we don't know how, the new idea will turn out to be cheap.
The CCH continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is an insolvent on funds allocated to the community sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Hencourtures, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of LCK.
As a result, more than 170 million roubles were overpayments of energy by the consumers of the region.
On the other day and at the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the Krasnodar province revealed the inclusion in tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And 4 million roubles were put on the rental of vehicles at a price higher than the market at the IY-Consulting OO costs.
And these are examples of the country's mass.
The people pay for the latter, and pay in a correct manner, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: the loss, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of power, etc.
According to the case of the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was involved in the renovation of urban sites, Makarov had entered into contracts with the entrepreneurs and had not actually worked on them but had been paid for.
Business guys just gave him most of the money.
And as master of UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers didn't pay and spend it on their own.
As a result of the damage to the budget and to the tenants, there are millions of roubles.
Makarov’s pattern of manipulation is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by UK leaders who paid money to citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Cohan continues, by the same token, with an ex-prosecutor accused of misdemeanours for 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigations, in 2012-2013, he established 6 company managers in Elysovo Kamchatka Province and set up 3 organizations with limited responsibilities.
One of them was for the KKK contractual work, the other two were the planning centres, that is, the public took the money.
However, in A. Cohan’s energy, the money was not spent on himself, a loved one.
The JCK trial is difficult.
There's no activity, there's too much delay.
And “help” in this very confusing housing legislation, is seen as Svetlana Réverneva, executive director of the MCS Control.
We're not going to be able to make one law as we come up with a new one that has to make the previous work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on LCAC.
The legal profession itself recognizes that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
Failures to initiate criminal proceedings, during investigations, are also reported in Genprocurature.
Out of the 35,000 crimes, fewer than half are brought before the courts in 2015.
The rest of the investigation was prolonged and each fifth suspended due to the failure to establish an accused person.
Often, deficiencies in law enforcement activities are described as gaps in existing legislation.
The law is there, but the authorities are not quick to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 counterfeiting reports - only 60 criminal cases had been initiated.
In five months of this year, the number increased only slightly to 99.
What is the falsification of the protocol of the Housing Assembly?
That means changing home administration, financial and other issues are overshadowing the opinion of owners.
And that also means that the housing services market cannot try normal companies that want to work fairly, not “dwell” the population.
It does happen, people living in mines, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole State, I am sure Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Committee on Property.
This work is now actively under way.
This is not just a single act, but a targeted course against corruption.
Of course, not all regions are so sad.
In particular, the capital does not smell like scandals.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow in the area of LCS, such as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown the iron will and order, says Aif, Anatoly Choseni, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue and the legislative amendments, and legal education.
Managers of companies have been closely monitored and have all been licensed.
The complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (residences and response measures are placed on the Moscow port of the Government).
Not only do many pay for monthly receipts but they carefully observe what is written on the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and of the obligations of resource providers and managers of organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow verified the validity of housing and community service tariffs, since a small part of the budget was subject to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Maybe it's all together to explain the calm atmosphere in Moscow.
Turns out everybody's back on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's easy to change the place of work.
Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan abandon his friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Rachel Taipe Erdogan, presented the United States with an ultimatum offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He said so by speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to abandon their support for the “terrorist organization of the fechulachists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the divisions between Turkey and the West are increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“It is or will be late for America to choose between Turkey and the FETO (“Terrorist organization of the fechulachists”).
Either organizing a FETO coup, or a democratic Turkey.
It must make that choice,” quote the Anatolia Agency for the Treatment of Erdogan, which spoke on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey, once again, has asked the U.S. to comply with his demand for the first time since the rebellion was suppressed.
Recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, the Turkish army, high-ranking representatives, attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority of the country and attempted the life of the Head of State.
However, after Rejep Erdogan had appealed to the people, the rebellion had been suppressed and his organizers and participants had been arrested.
Some 8,000 people, in addition to the military, have been suspected of being teachers and scientists.
Rejep Erdogan, their mentor, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
The Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The Panel recommends no compensation in the amount of USD 54,319 for this claim.
The last statement by the Gosdép representatives in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, but insists on his own and also makes demands on other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the Migration Agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls for a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish nationals”, on 9 August the Minister of Turkey for EU Affairs Omer Chelic.
He said that Ancar's introduction of a change in anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Note that on 1 August, German Vice-Centler Zigmar Gabriele demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing Europe by promising to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to the statement made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevluta Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglo made in the past Wednesday allowed Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish MID has not ruled out that the country will consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it meets the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign States in the defence of the use of missiles,” said Chavushoglu in an interview with the Audrelu Agency.
He said that Turkey now needed to build its own defence system on the basis of its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
“To date Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others,” said the Minister.
The experts believe that this is an indication of Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and of the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Rejep Erdogan is currently playing his game and is not in a position to engage in violent confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West, and from the point of view of business, and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance itself by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although it would certainly be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient human being in this post," explained AIF.ru.
He said that it was not possible for the Turkish leader (on non-payment of compensation by the EU, on the demand of non-loans from Europe and on the extradition of Gulen from the United States) to issue him.
“Rejep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with America and with the European Union, which will put him on humanitarian issues, for the dictatorial methods of governance of the country and so on,” said Minchenko.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his views with Russia as soon as he does so.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely strong stand against Russia and sought favor in the West in every way.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
The guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again is not.
I think Erdogan's in a moment of shuttle diplomacy.
When he gets between the two poles, the West and Russia, he's going to try to get the maximum benefit for himself," says Mohin.
In his view, the main task for the Turkish President today is to maintain political power in the country, and for that reason he needs Russia and his partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Galen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East through it.
The expert believes that consensus will be reached with Turkey.
Another view was that of Anna Glasov, head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Turkey’s relationship with the EU and the US is now quite tense, and it is primarily linked to the domestic policies that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to re-load policies in both the Middle East and Russia.
It is not by accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim that they are prepared to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, have settled relations with Israel, are actively engaged in political interaction with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glasov, assuming that the next step by Erdogan will be normalizing relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan was currently pursuing was to return to a foreign policy concept that had been followed by Turkey before the Arab revolutions.
On the other hand, Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively on “no problems with its neighbours”.
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa have now taken place.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and enhance Turkey's position on both the regional and international levels,” the expert considers.
Glasov is of the view that it will be extremely difficult to return to Turkey ' s former relations with the EU, the question now is whether the EU will start to respond strictly to Turkey, which can go to opening up borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Demand for associate doctors: Calls for new collective protests
Assistant doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract of employment.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Committee of Medical Assistants (JDC) is about to request its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Associate doctors and medical students voted in July for the abolition of the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, President JDC, Ellen McCorth, said that the Government had continued to “keep quiet” about the problems she had said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the current situation, the head of JDC voted in favour of the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full volume and called for formal re-negotiation of all your matters.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, the leader of JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse a continuing programme of expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The problem has led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA Medical Assistants, Dr. Joan Malwana, resigned after voting for the abolition of the agreed labour contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the transaction was a good one to be accepted during the meetings, in advance of the vote of 54,000 medical doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey, "Aljans the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the gilded palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ancar wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked prolonged, and he hardly got warm, even in his own restraints.
Rejep Taipe Erdogan, in contrast, said that Mr. Putin, on several occasions, said that he was his friend, Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that his relationship with Russia would be restored not only to their pre-crisis level but even to higher levels.
The next day a newspaper described the actions of Mr. Erdogan as if nothing had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the prolonged cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was what he referred to in the introductory comments: Turkey had shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was not true.
Mr. Putin was struck by an angry tyrant, accusing Ankaru of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real confidence would be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, State-controlled media have been carrying out a shocking, complete attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, Turks were to be found guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had been pressured on the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory for a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a armistice are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he almost got out of his post last month when he attempted a coup.
His repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey must have shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have been severely hit — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell dramatically by almost 90 percent.
With regard to Russia, the tour operators and charterers here will certainly find relief when the flights finally resume.
They're putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the season.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists out there, tomatoes come back here," as the report said in the World Report.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ancar of evil to the West for what she considers a weak response to an attempt to overthrow.
Add to this her prolonged frustration with the turtle’s pace of joining the EU and the step taken by Mr. Putin — who seeks to enjoy the cool and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the painful points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after an attempt at a coup d'état.
Think of it as a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as “alians of the bad”: two countries that felt rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Yet, despite a public show of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently identified itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it's better that two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be classified as a bank office, according to the Bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since he almost moved eight years ago and had to save him.
During this period, the brand strategies used RBS to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of co-sponsorship for international sport, from six nations' Cups to the Umbldon Cup, Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is appropriate to allow more national brands to take the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all links to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller, smaller brands for banking services for individuals who will get more influence -- Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave interviews during client and staff tours in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one where our staff will be engaged, because we're now more banked."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am saying that we no longer have a global desire; we have a local desire.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not be possible to continue its sponsoring support to the six-nation Cuban Cuba, and it is increasing the profile of different brands in sponsoring sport.
"It's a good time for us to move a brand bank, because on the basis (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we were to say that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all those brands.
But with the work that we did, focusing on customer needs, not on our own, I think, you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back again, so I think it's time.
The Franks of the Detectives reach 3,000 winners with victory in Newmarket at the Passion.
It's the kids who cut the champagne after the rendezvous in Newmarthe brings it to 3,000.
Joke Frankie Dettore made his 3000th British victory in Newmark on Friday.
He came to this famous mark with the help of his second night winner on his home track, on the Passion trained by John Hosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Listor Piggott, Pat Idderi and Willie Carson.
The three-fold champion of the Deuters, who had won the Geyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarnet, because it's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal AK is an ordinary Friday evening with 2,000 people.
I'm free of business, and I'm very uncomfortable.
The children get applause when they win.
Two jockeys were marked by the obstacles of the jockey champion Richard Johnson and the retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 winning a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Dharby winner, 4,493 winning a career
Frankie is one of the best of modern times, and it is not surprising that he reached the mark that so few had reached him.
He's stylish and strong, but that's his tactical smile that distinguishes him from the others in the spring room.
He's a great guy to jump, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago to Eps, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a bunch of weekend and big jumps!
If it's serious, Frankie's been bringing the winners in Britain for a lot of 30 years, which's great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British jumps, but even more, he's an incredible gum.
Frankie Detectives have celebrated this outstanding mark with a brandy quick jump from a horse.
From quick to quick-blown dates, Frankie Detective is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was takeoff and fall.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his famous "The Great Sword" in Ascot in 1996, but he also went through a plane crash and went through the discalibration because of his doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the great power of will to challenge skeptics and return to shape.
And he may not have finished for a while -- the children had earlier said that they wanted to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of administration, Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s trusted neighboring circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed a representative for environment and transport.
The statement from Kremlin states that Putin “resolved Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President”, but did not call the reason.
Mr. Ivanov, Deputy Mr. Ivanov, was appointed as his successor since 2012.
Mr. Wyna, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in Estonia’s capital, Tallinn, in 1972, ended the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Government's office, reporting the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for Your Trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of State in drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be released from that position and had recommended that Vino replace him.
Do you know what you're saying?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the CGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned at his own wish.
Despite smiling at the camera, however, few have been convinced here — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the unintended consequences of some struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement is that the person who was once convicted as a potential president suddenly wanted to rule Russian environmental policy was met with tremendous skepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that in early 2012, I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even a troubled post, for four years.
Well, I get, I was the president's head of administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the Public Security Service of the CGB, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSS), which replaced HGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since the third term for Putin would contradict the Constitution.
However, this position was taken by another close advocate of Putin, Dimitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
The Star series was "Taste as a Criminal" by Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a participant in a show rendezvous in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce serials, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in surveys and differences of opinion.
I’m sorry about this," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the Gibson character will be taken off the show following the FBI agent team is expected later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in the Scaffold Dam and Greg was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love to think as a criminal and put my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but now it will be impossible.
I would just like to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, above all, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It is expected that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Inference: The fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa sought the help of identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfe.
Kevin Bene believes that 75 fish might have been sands left in water death.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, took a survey of this spectacle to Perisscope in the hope that anyone would be able to shed light on two-year-old fish.
Bridge is now connected to Fife
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers linked the northern passage and the Wyduk Kwinsferri Crossing — which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
It's the first of the four jigsaws between the fans of the canvas that are now coming to complete all three pilots of the bridge.
The Faif Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 cents of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Kit Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferri Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering in a truly epic scale in this project, with over 30,000 tons of concrete being used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the mixture between the weed and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79 per cent of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete covering is being poured out to Rosta today, which means that all the canvas is ready to be raised on the site on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Project, said, "The first shift on each bridge project is a always meaningful milestone.
In this remarkable project, this development is the most modern construction art.
After the installation of the last section of the road canvas and its connection with the expanding Northern Dust Road Paper, we were left to close the remaining curtain on the north — or side to the shore.
This was done by supporting a North-Aduct approach of 700 millimetres south.
It was a massive but very impressive operation.
The scale, because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was supposed to be raised to an angle of about 3%.
The impressive thing is that the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it went very well.
Salvation in the Gulf of Moelfr: The three men had to stay alive.
Three men's had to stay alive after they were thrown out of the fishing ship in England.
The Maelfrre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13:20 a.m. on Friday, after the team saw an accident in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place while their ship continued its course.
"We saw their ship walking next to them and expecting the worst," said Maelfre Wins Jones's steering lifeboat.
"Thank you, by the time we went down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found to be exhausted and trapped in a boom without a life jacket.
All of them were taken to the rescue station on board the lifeboat
Jones said: "The three men who are thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine had an emergency scooter, but he somehow snuck away from the man who was driving the boat when it woke up.
Somebody saved these guys today.
Pokémon Go, decent hunting for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screen, has been a complaint to many in the past decade.
Pokemon Goo is poisoning people off the couch and engaging in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited by television, video games and recently smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, full involvement, which is Pokémon Go, an annex based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the consequence of a series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, this has lost track of relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to the massive response that the servers had reloaded.
Pokémon Go had more users in his days than Tinder and nearly as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pockmons who are tracking GPS and, if they're discovered, they can be 's photographed' or 's engravings'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined in the dangling delight of drawing off the couches for search.
In the United States, playing has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a “normal” person every day.
Cardiogram, an annex for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Whistington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of people tracked every 30 minutes had risen from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, but it's just looking at the primary levels.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to find 30 minutes, to stand on the couch, and to be active every day, have not been answered because most of the health-care messages are boring and are expressed by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who regularly practice themselves reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to be brought here.
But Pokémon Go is that she's pulling people out on the street to do what they love.
Thus, three health bases are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends to hunt.
As usual, there are the boring bundles that they're looking for, which they're welcome to.
And yes, someone might end up on the door.
So what?
There's a breakthrough.
After all, applications for smartphones, such as Fatbite, were able to continue to track our physical activity, but they did not give us the opportunity to exercise, as this game gives us.
Novice will arrive, and use will weaken over time.
But thanks to the success of Paulmon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to seek to be more active, in good shape and in good health.

Simon Biles wins the gold of absolute perfection in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the money.
Simon Biles is irresponsible for all of this.
Dynamic on back jump.
Unenforceable for a log.
A madman on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic championship.
A 19-year-old American gymnasium rose to the title of the champion on Thursday, putting the gap between itself and the rest of the world to a convincing demonstration under the profile of the Olympics.
Her general score was sufficient distance from the silver medal and the teammate Eli Riceman and the Russian bronze medal Ali Mustafina.
Biles, from the United States, is on the gymnasium log during the finale of the women's individual absolute degree in artistic hypnosis on 2016 summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of the absolute championship and the fifth of all, preserving her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She broke up when she was shown her final general ball and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Felix, who raised their sports to new heights:
Biles spent the last three years dominated by his sport, winning 15 honey champions of the world -- including 10 gold -- with such amazing programmes in their mixture of labour and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnasium I have ever seen”.
One final test was waiting in Brazil, not so much competition between Biles and others, but between her and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to the family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unreserved expectation.
Simon Biles of the United States, on the left, and Ali Riceman are held after the win-up of gold and silver in the final date of the women's individual absolute degrees for artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, etc.
Biles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final accompaniment for the farewell party coordinator Martha Karola.
While Biles insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, it wasn't.
A part of her military training program — her firm passage — was set out for Latin - American music, which would go right outside of the city of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandfather and grandmother as a child and an open mother to Coach Amy Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach became a force.
She hasn't won a single competition on absolute permanence since the summer of 2013, a lane of luck that should last as long as Biles wanted.
Although Mustaphina had a small advantage with two directives, it was a mirage.
The hypnotic log and the leisure exercises — where Biles defends the so - called championship of the world — lie in the ambush.
It went forward again from 15.433 on the log and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Riceman gently hugged her while they were waiting for a final account — pure formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red with white and blue pups for Biles when the design that she had once recorded in a cutting album was carried out.
Riceman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she divided the third place, but she lost a bronze at Mustafina's secret.
This time, a 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call a boab, was much ahead.
It sent a crowd kiss after its military exercise to return, which at times seemed to be a question.
With regard to Biles, the 19-year-old virus tweet now has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case were shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Finix over the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to a Thursday police report.
Angela Roschel Lyner, Stephanie R. Elis and daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June, when their car was parked on the carriageway, the authorities declared.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, and then hiding on another vehicle, reported in the report.
The police state that the three-way murder does not appear to be the result of robbery, since the perpetrator did not take a wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of an adult victim.
Officer of the Finnish Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard stated that he had caused the investigators to check if he had been involved in four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, branch office of CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have been used by several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they had concluded that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Allis, age 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lyner, 31 years old, and Ellic's daughter, Malia, died still.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a report to the police on the shelling, which was intended to be an empty pick-up half an hour before the triple murder and was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the branches and removed the bullets from the seat and fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old microcephalia: "It's getting better."
As most six - year - olds, Edmund Pixivto loves drinking, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund had microcephalus, a genetic defect that his mother Elizabeth Piquisito did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What, in fact, is not true -- of course you're signing on it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that yet," said Piquisito.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he's three, and he's still not talking.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He goes outside and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and drink.
Elizabeth's gesture is shown by Edmund's gesture for "I'm sorry, sing me."
"We teach him his sign language," said Piquisito CBS News.
But not just the common sign language — she says that Edmund has developed his own gestures.
Microcephalia may arise from a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmund, infection during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeka.
Symptoms and predictions may vary considerably.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zeka virus.
Pic stand in mind the emotional loss caused by an uncertain future.
Did I tell you what would happen all the time?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Piquisito has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zeka.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
The heavy rain, floods, is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Missouri
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even greater rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and southern Mississippi have departed and threatened with large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Luiziana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to affected arrivals.
Mike Steele, representative of the Office of the Governor of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that high water, boat and sandbags were being requested.
Stil said that only the arrival of Tangipaho had invited tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains until Saturdays in most of the south of Luiziana.
The Mete Service said in a statement that an additional three to five inches could blow into the field.
In southern Alabama, duty - keeping was fixed until Friday, as the rain continued to enter the Mobil area.
The river Comit near Baton Rogo and the river Emith near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to set a record of flood levels in the past weekend.
The synoptic Aleek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Ruja.
He also said that the flooding flowing down the Assenchen approach was a threat, as those rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morp.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9:00 a.m. on Friday.
The rescuers were still throwing people out of the floods in the districts of Emit and Wilkinson in south-west Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pastures were among those saved early on Friday at Gloster's.
Hansford, 62 years old, says the Bever Creek waters, which are usually over 400 feet from his house, quickly rose in the night.
He said that another pasture, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up, and the water kept coming, ” said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that this was the biggest tributary she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family had disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue officials saved all three by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Glutter, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods are spreading rapidly, as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann said that one observer near Livingstone had reported an fall of 13.75 inches [13.75 inches] of rain from midnight to Friday.
Krautmann said that the soil was refilled with rainfalls from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the work of rescuing residents from homes in Tanjipaho, and the removal of their classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, a CBS branch office, reports that adviser Tanjipahoa told of 200 destroyed homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both inundating now.
Robby Miller's President stated that 72 people and seven animals in high water had been rescued by the authorities.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amith and Hammond to welcome those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to go home as soon as the water starts retreating," he said.
In Hammond, Tanjipaho's arrival, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sand bags were available for distribution to the residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March, ” said city manager Lacey Landdrum.
It's on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Rupert Lacey, head of the Emergency Service reported that the heavy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been registered as flooding on Thursday, but none had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of Hopper's Super Value Foods in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Tuson, "and she's still on the ground."
Maház Brown, 6, "resulted by bullets", remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia
Police report that in Philadelphia, a 6-year-old boy was shot by a 6-year-old in a 6-year-old shooting in town this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather were identified for CBS Philadelphia as Machzez Brown.
The grandmother and grandfather say that Brown suffered multiple shootings, including his scent, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious of being taken to hospital.
"He's got a lot of money, his little body has been removed by the bullet," says his grandmother Derez Mellandez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has survived several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to recover.
He had to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantaun district.
They also shot three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-olds is reported to have been in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed men.
A number of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, have been identified as having taken place.
It must have been a long battle.
There were branches on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the station’s police captain Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in the area were also footped.
No arrests have been carried out, and the police are reportedly inspecting video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm of a sewing bullet on Tuesday when he played in front of his home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabi and Lori?
That's what I call this women's Olympics collection for the hypnosis of this year and for several reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer of the Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnastics play a key role in this assembly: Simon Biles, Gabbi Douglas and Loreen Hernández, who have inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this assembly, complemented by Ali Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Cochan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This assembly looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, women's hypnotic number one has been African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
Last time Olympiad Gabbi Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed.
The world could now witness an incredible presentation by the three-fold Peace Championships Simons, Douglas and Lori Hernández, who perform unexpected but yet virtual gymnasmic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in a woman's individual absolute firstborn.
And Ali Riceman's teammate got silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in the gymnasiums all over the country.
Simon, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final five because the next Olympic hypnotic assembly is going to have only four gymnastics on the team, and that's Martha Caroly's last year of training.
But in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnasiums, supported by parents, paid for training, equipment, travel, uniforms, contributions for competition, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnast clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where the gymnasiums receive everything from their training, and this is a road and long-term responsibility for the family of the gymnasiums.
Amy Burman, Coach Simony Bailey, and Maggie Hanie, coach Lori Hernández, both of them have been training their athletes since they started their gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and accessible gymnastic education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnast foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics, located in Harlem, for over 15,000 young people (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide a high-quality gymnasium of young people that deserves to be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastika develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and mental persistence.
This combination has had a lifelong positive effect on good health, success in school and in work.
It is the inspiration of this assembly that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's fine.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
Now is a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Lori, Gabbi and Madison for this serious demonstration of the “Women's Force” in the win-up of commanding Olympic gold and for prompting so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have taken up the announcement of further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing with the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first associate doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night work and weekends to improve service during extra-hour periods.
Dr. Ellen McCacot, chairman of the BMA committee of young doctors, said last night in a statement: “The assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will raise up the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors”.
It is only eight weeks before the first team of doctors is sent to a new contract, and progress is required, and time is needed.
The attempt by WMA to resolve the dispute was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes with full silence on the part of the Government.
And this is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremie Hunte needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the fears of associate doctors.
If he doesn't, then younger doctors are clear that they're ready to do next strikes.
The last step in late April resulted in a delay of some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 receipts of nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to support the replacement of doctors for picketing lines.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing on a modified agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants better payment of holidays for 54,000 associate doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employers, urged doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: “The guarantees are little or nothing, but they put pressure on already working on teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, farmers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been talking to the Committee of Nurses and together with the Department of Health and others, and have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The employees hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in pay in medicine, was a sign of the extent to which employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the IMA in November, February and May.
The two-to-day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for two days, after the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer periods.
The antiretroviral drug can reduce the risk of reabsorption for people with heart disease.
The drug has already been assigned 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Monitoring Service of the British National Health Service has suggested that it be given to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE Monitoring Service of the British National Health Service has now suggested that it be given to people for four years so that the risk of cardiovascular problems can be eliminated.
A heart attack is taking place with approximately 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of arteries and the formation of cans.
If the head breaks in part, it can cause a tromba blocking the blood’s access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the plate moves, it'll be able to travel through the flow of blood and block the bleeding to the brain by causing an stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
The Tekagralor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold as Brilica, reduces the risk by making the troms less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, which has been published today, recommends that 90 mg of cycagralore be given to people for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite effective secondary prevention techniques, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack will experience another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences”.
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative effect on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that cycagralor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes from people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it, with the prior recommendation of the Tikagralor.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of cycagralor, especially the risk of bleeding, has been limited over three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for longer than that period.
The PK culture allows for the falsification of a vote in Muslim areas
Ex-M. Tauer-Hamlets Lutfor Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption by means of a government report
The culture of political adjustment has led to the closing of the eye, which has resulted in widespread falsification of the vote in Muslim communities, according to the devastating report of the Government announced today.
The former Cabinet member, Sir Eric Pyckles, is criticized by the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of electoral violations because of “extraordinary sensitivity to race and religion”.
A former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religious voters had been so strong that the police should be allowed to place borders outside the polling stations in order to protect the afraid voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors should merely specify their name and address.
The report even suggests that non-sympathizing ink on the finger of people when they give up their ballots, so as not to allow anyone to vote twice.
We need to provide better protection to the informers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to the press by local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It is done not only to protect itself from fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud, which goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a scandal with a vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters decided that the current mayor, Lufhur Rahman, should have been removed from office on a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “curiously distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, “began his campaign based on the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him”.
Up to 300 votes had been questioned or were the result of a person ' s being called by someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about post-voting fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in a photograph, made a few recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring that he bring his identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: “The evidence of pressure against vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, has been provided to vote on the will of older persons, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... public institutions have closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the over-sensitive “political adjustment” of ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from work with the Postal ballot papers to stop “the harvest of votes”.
The report also calls for strengthened registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
Option is being considered to require voters to present an identity card before the vote.
Use non-smoking ink on the fingers of people as soon as they throw out their ballots to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of people's nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit on the application for automatic postal ballots.
Remove political participants in campaigns and activists from work with filled ballots and mail envelopes.
To give the police authority to establish boundaries around the polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the filing of allegations of intimidation under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Illegal photographing at polling stations.
Require English only to be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that people are forced to go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is a violent attack on the City Police, stating that it is “atrocious” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tauer-Hamlets case.
“The Court of Electoral Affairs disqualified Lutfor Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticizes the unreserved “checks for the heads” of the Electoral Registration Divisions of the City Administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The court order in Tauer Hamlets was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as a mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities are threatening this good reputation.
Dr. Kate's mind and other doubles of the Olympics in Rio.
The 2016 Olympiad fans in Rio have gone mad this week on the French bicycle of Polin Ferrand-Predo, which appears to be quite similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But a 24 - year - old member of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete fighting for gold in this summer who can admire his own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who show up on our screens for the moment, F of yours has compiled a list of Olympians with more than a superficial similarities with the Hollywood Stars.
Honor and wolf: Member of the U.S. male archer Brady Allison, on the left, compared Leonardo D.C.C. since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s bicycle track, many people have been on the Internet to point out how a certain archer might be the twin of Leonardo D.C.
A member of the U.S. male archer's team, Brady Allison, was the cause of a storm in Twitter after the images of it appeared to look frighteningly like a Wall Street star.
And in fact, the archer learned about social madness and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo ever since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, maybe with the exception of vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point out even more this year: the striking similarity between the British railway Greg Rierford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnasium Alia Mustafina, with her great clear eyes said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estafan.
In the South African pool, Kameron van der Burga has been compared to Hor Matthew Morrison for years.
Turning to the unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a "opposed version" of the actor "Samul"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennisist Rafael Nadar and actor Joshua Harnett, who may boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medallist from Russia, Yulia Efimova, may boast not only of the same cold skin and bright hair as an actress AnnaLin McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to the fans, is like “Joseph Horgon Levit’s controversial version”.
Surly women: Hope Solo football Star on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpether from Dexter, on the right, have the same shape of face and eyes.
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple’s appearance.
A Twitter user recently asked the site to share his message that “the latest Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical”.
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Daxter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Wals Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lora Linni, as well as the winning golden medal of Gabby Douglas, which may boast of its own beautiful broad smile that resembles Gabriel Union's smile of success.
CBC commentator of the Olympiads apologize for the statement made about the Chinese bottle "died like a pig"
Byron McDonald's fourth seat on final 14-year-old Ai Yanghan on the female estathea in the 4x200 m military style was blown into the atmosphere by CBC viewers in direct broadcast of the Olympiad
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese singer had "old as a warrior" and "died like a pig" during the flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final woman's essay of 4x200 m in a free style.
You could hear that McDonald, who was brought to the CBC commentators' team to "spoil it with color," said, "It's a 14-year-old whale that dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, old-fashioned, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
A 14 - year - old Chinese pavilion passed the second phase of the estapheta in 1:57.79 for 1.61 seconds slower than Taylor Ruck’s canal, allowing Canadians to close their distance from China.
Stars across Canada quickly responded to the network after being shaken by tones and expressions used
Emmet McFarlane said, "Did the CBC actually just say that a 14-year-old bird from China was dead like a pig?"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yang, from China, in the finaline of the women's epiphany, 4200 m in free style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism in Twitter struck immediately at Byron McDonald, and many called for him to be fired.
Twitter users didn't abstain when they heard how unfeeling Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Parades, wrote, "There's nothing else to do with #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgussted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was conducting a CBC transmission, apologized in live air for the comment of McDonald, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the voyage to air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
SAF concluded that it had apologized to more than 90 people who had reported in response to this statement
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize for Makdonald's face
CBC then copied and sent an apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about the McDonald comments
The TV also hurried to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our audience in live air and our subscribers in social media.
Let's make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance, not about it as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized on a live screen and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think that his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman's essay,' he said on CBC broadcasts.
'I've been talking about a half-hearted speech, not her in person.'
'I mean, of course, there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
The buyer, Primark, insulted a woman who had unveiledly used lower underwear in the middle of a store.
The buyers didn't know where to look, when a woman was wearing a woman's pants, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried what she looked like, pulled them off, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bowie Polace Trade Center store in Falklandston.
Prymark Shopveie Space Trade Center in Foxton, where a woman used three - wheeled panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at this time in the store, said that after an example of the underwear, a mysterious woman was dressed again and went out of the store, bought nothing.
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she picked up a pair of panties, pulled off her own shirts and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere hidden to do this -- she was just standing there, lying down."
"They all stood up when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked here, dressed again and came out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, or that she was thinking about a man who would eventually buy those rabbits she was trying to model."
Jenny Davidson, a 33-year-old from Kent, said, "It's hard to think someone's going to take home rabbits that someone else was already carrying, and they weren't alone."
The accident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I find that the staff seemed to be trying to remove these items from the sale after she left -- well, better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's rabbits and find out that another woman did and took them off, and they weren't naked."
The representative of Primark said, "Primark knows about the accident that happened at our store in Foxton on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods in question were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a carpet
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Myzcreci, the Federation's master shop in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether it comes to you in front or in the back, this video will show you how to beat a robber of his own weapons.
If they come from behind, according to Mizra, the first thing to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you put a gun between your forebear and your shoulder firmly, before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then you follow the knee in the scent, and while the attacker bends his pain, you pull the gun out of his hand, beat it in the face with a gun, and step back, holding the gun on it.
For an armed person on the front, the way to do so is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun, and shoot it so that the thief can't shoot.
At the same time, move weight to the gun and hit the fist in your chest, then pull the gun out of his wave before you step back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizcrey is doing.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery — if you're not a rug master — is to give your cash.
For a traveller, Jan Wright does his language in the most dirty places in Europe.
The British traveler has tested his immune system and a huge reflex, decoupling some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leading and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, 51 years from Soffolk, conducted a euro bank, the Persians of the Church of Piccadili, the toilet button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of their immune system.
He used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's getting into.
But the experiment that should become a film entitled “The Guide to Putish Language on the Inner Force” has produced some surprising results.
The idea of cutting the wash button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there is actually more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Throughout the European trip, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about increasing intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the embittered brought him more than a bad taste of mercury.
Wright became known for her intestinal strength, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From community pens on the station to the toilet button, this task has undoubtedly been tested by his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, "From childhood I've been completely careless of my health, and I've been putting a lot of different things in my mouth out of the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test brush showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the hands that have just been washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his lemometer was more than 4,000, whereas the fresh arms show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio filmed a travel guide entitled “Putishman's Manual on Inner Power”, which demonstrates the amount of bacteria in different locations, for example, in the toilet.
He said in the film, "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's ugly.
The "Puestine-Lizwana Guide on the Inner Force" was removed along with the Finnish Valio dairy manufacturer.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Valio Vice President of the Valio, juices and new categories of Nico Voorrenma said: 'We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
What would be of interest to see and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "give Jan a ring."
They claim that an interest in the intestine’s health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about food, we wanted to put it in a more context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
A growing interest in the health of the intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about this in interesting form.
I also think the film shows we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hacala, who was the film director, said, "Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan if he had licked some of the things I asked, like the hideous Russian toilet that's shown in the film."
Of course, some things Jana had been easier to lick, and some were rather rigid.
I'm glad that some of these slips we've been able to take the film off.
In the poll conducted in 2015 in Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acidic bacteria to extremely good stomach and intestines, while 58 per cent said they were using, at least sometimes, products containing acidic bacteria added.
The Huliganov family destroyed Salita, Cornwall Municipal Home, on the eve of evictions
The hooligan families left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000, after they had been hanged for intimidation from their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their real estate site in Salita, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the real estate facility, the shocked housing co-operatives found the property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left open with brimstones, half of them were exposed, the trash was scattered over the floor, and the walls were filled with graphites.
The family is now displaced and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, the settler at Cornwall Hoosing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed down, because this real estate facility is probably not going to be known as a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time and the police reported that the family’s horrors included fights on the street with baseball beatings, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and corruption.
Skaldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behaviour in June.
Old garbage found in several rooms at home that could be snowy.
Sex docks in a house in which drugs were sold in the past have been removed
The neighbors say they saw the fights in the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Hosing forcibly removed her and her partner this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The evictions were welcomed with relief by the neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't worry.
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet, we didn't get used to it!
Now that they finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood team, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years with the police, and they regularly called the police
The porter and the old toys were spread below the ground side of the municipal house
He added: 'It's a shame that the lessee was unable to accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, because evictions are always the last method of action to consider Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case, because behaviour was a limit, and their actions must have been terrible for her observer neighbours.
I appreciate the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community, have done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will provide some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in a house at different times, but said they all had a little more than 20.
Flammable mattress left on the floor in one of the burned houses after eviction
Resettlement workers will now be required to remove the debris that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights, related supplies and $1,700 in cash.
Skaldon was fined after he found himself guilty of taking over class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that she was paying her son's tomb, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were filled with graphites all over the surface.
Police said they would try to evict tenants who were not subject to the rental regulations.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message for those who feel they can act without charges by the prosecutor, as well as those who are harming such behaviour,' she said.
Crime and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourist in Portugal was terrified when a low-wing military aircraft almost touched the beach.
In Aweiro, Portugal, tourists who love to go to the sun were afraid for their lives
P-3C Air Force aircraft from Portugal flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start panicking, while the low - flying plane was flying over the crowded beach.
There is a military aircraft flying just about a distance from the hunters on the sand strip in Aweiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became obvious for reasons were concerned with the noise of the aircraft's engines, but were unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near Aweiro, Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the several resters who published a video of a shocking flight on social networks, said, "It went through at least twice, and there was a moment when it seemed to break up at some point."
Nuno Arroga added, "I was a serfingo, and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the Avira beach were terribly frightened when the plane came out of the fog and flew at extremely low altitudes
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion pilot was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and had to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had been flying a little lower than was usually due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby mountainous forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland part of Portugal, as well as killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low because of circumstances — thick fog and forest fires that had worsened the visibility
The flight was conducted on a train, and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats in a task
The HASSP system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of Petersburg's coffee and restaurants have not yet been operational.
Checks are becoming more active and business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazar Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of SPAS) system - risk analysis and critical control points - mandatory for the use of food by producers and carriers and general operating companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Business checks by Roscourdestor for compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
In the meantime, however, officials only issue fines for certain violations of the regulations (see the "Press of Documents" ...).
In general, failure to comply with the regulations would result in an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first violation and one million roubles for the second.
The SWAps, a system that addresses the risks and prevention of food, developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of astronaut food.
The system is now being used in all food plants not only in the United States but in Canada and Europe as well.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on TC territory.
The business system was developed and implemented for 4 years (HASSP requirements came from TC technical in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food production, rather than to the resbytors, and explained to the head of the Public Council, Elena Cretels.
Now everyone's trying to make sure the lost one is gone.
The expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey - end of August - early September.
But they won't call the demand because their target audience -- families with children -- is already preparing for school, experts notice.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday asking for permission of the charterers.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible marine rest is unresolved, since the majority of the facilities have already been reserved by the end of September in the Kurts of the Krasnodar Province and the Republic of Crime,” notes the authors of the letter and emphasizes that opening of charters in August will not significantly affect the current demand for Russian maritime products.
As reported in the North-West Regional Branch of the Russian Union, the tour industry (RCT), in the event that the Russian and Turkish aviation authorities quickly agree, the resumption of chartered flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charterers are reactivated so far, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programmes and agree with airlines on the direction of ships,” says Paul Rumiant, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RTA.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news but would not affect the market because the major buyers of chartered tours, families with children, had already returned from vacation and were preparing for school or were taking vacations in other countries.
During the barhat season, tours are mainly for solitary travellers and couples.
"Corritics can count on those who are able to rest spontaneously," said Paul Rumiant.
"There's a chance in Turkey to attract a lot of tourists if she's going to give a very budget -- 50 to 60,000 roubles for two-way tours, because there's people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valérie Rosenthal, Director-General of the Optio-Tavel Service.
Otherwise, you don't have to count on the canvas -- the main mass of the journey is already planned.
Paul Romania also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charterers will also be required, but it is not worth waiting for too much.
"To Turkey, the launch of charters now is a practice of the next season," says Paul Romanians.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season," agrees Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from VATL of compensation payments established by law, within approved rules relating to the compensation of damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers with hazardous work conditions is provided for under article 222 of the RF.
However, the rules and conditions of extradition are established by Order No. 45n of the Ministry of Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009.
According to the document, free issuance of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers on days of de facto employment with hazardous working conditions resulting from harmful workplace factors.
On the basis of these rules, the Russian FNF, in the letter under review, concluded that, on the basis of abs. 2rd of article 217 of the FML, exempts from the laying down of VATL the income of milk produced to employees on days of de facto employment with hazardous working conditions in accordance with the Regulations and conditions approved by Order 1602.2009 No. 45n of the Ministry of Social Development of Russia.
The Moscow Gasstroybank has not been licensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for banking transactions from the Acervatory Commercial Bank of the GAZCKYBAK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACS 'GOSTRITBAN ' has implemented a highly defined credit policy for the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks at the request of the oversight body and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led the credit organization to provide grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in doubtful transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank until appointment to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive of the credit organization under federal laws are suspended.
AOCB "GOSTRABAN" is a member of the investment insurance system.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to the bank's investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ, “On the insurance of the contributions of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation” is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the fund balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles combined by one investor.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reports, the size of ACS's assets, “GAZRSTRABN” on 1 August 2016, was 335 in the RF banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined HIL died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of three British high school students who left London last year to join IHIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tassim Akundji said that her family had learned of her death in Rakke, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of Russian Rakke air strikes, a rigged group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursdays.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, was killed when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It may only be hoped that the only advantage of this is as a vagaries and a willing to others that it is the risks that are involved in going to the war zone to defeat people in the same way, ” said Akundji.
In February 2015, the sultan and two other students from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family said that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Galand as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected
The Democratic Leader of the Senate of Harry Reid said that he was convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would be named as President Merrick Gasland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Senate had blocked the approval of Ghanland and, as President Barack Obama had nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group at the Mitch McConnell Senate states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Skali.
Reed said in the launch conference on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of confidence”.
The representative of Reed later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to come up with Garland, and just built up assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to do a boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reed claimed that the Republicans who block the Mostland mine were the "swimmers" and "assistants" of a Republican candidate to President Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was not suitable for office.
Treatys states that the erotic calendars for women as well as men's calendars.
The Treatys magazine collaborates with a photographer, David Beller, to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of being nudgly famous, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017, with the muzzled musams.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, with a lot of naked models, is different from old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of a permanent and classical figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman's body,” said Shaw in a calendar press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can take photos online or in person at open tapes in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given reminders of Internet misdemeanours.
In Moscow, we're going to release a monument that tells us how not to be a victim of an online shop.
They reported it in Roscupnazore, M24.
It is reported that government professionals are preparing a monument that will help citizens to select the Internet correctly and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, regulations for the delivery of goods and ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim properly and so forth,” explained in Roscurnadzor.
The memory is being developed to date.
It will later be posted on the Rozcourdzrez web site in Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a print version and distribute to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling the second suspect's name in the Diversity Organization in Crimea.
Persons from Ukrainian and Russian nationals were detained and assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panain Eugenius Alexandrovich and Zakhte Andrei Romanović.
"They all give confessions," says the message.
Previously, Avgenius Panov, who was arrested on suspicion of terrorist organization in Crimea, confessed his guilt of interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine for a Google corporation of 438 million roubles on the agency website.
"The total violation of anti-monopoly legislation for Google was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay our fine soon," stated Deputy FAS Alexei Docenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies smartphone manufacturers sold in Russia to Google Play applications only if other corporate applications are installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search engine, which must be placed on the smartphone main screen.
Thus, the corporation is in violation of article 10 (1) of the HLC “On the Protection of Competition” (abuse of dominant positions).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulation will provide an opportunity for developing competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including the Chief of the Russian Federation's Communications and Information Technology Administration Office, Elena Zaeva.
The department suspected 16 Russian shops of conspiracy.
The New Book Network has fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide."
A network of New Bookshops is fined for selling Stace Kramer 50 days before my suicide, reports Moscow City News Agency.
The text of the book could be considered as “provoking or motivating the conduct of children and adolescents” without specifying the amount of the fine, according to the Roztordzorz.
The Constant District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine with 49 copies of print products seized by the Office of Roscuddzor.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookshops in Moscow were being checked for having a book “50 Days Before My Suicide”.
Hernst Unknowable will be remembered in Moscow.
In Moscow, there will be a memory of the sculptor Ernest the Unknown, reports the TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August in the Central Home of Literators.
Unfortunately, not all will be able to say goodbye to the Unknownman in the United States.
It was therefore decided that this evening would be arranged for those who wanted to celebrate it on their home land,” stated the Russian Jewish Congress press service.
It noted that this was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
For the evening, close friends of the Unknown One were invited, including the poet Eugenius Evtushenko, the artist Boris Messer, the President of the GMI, Mr. Puskin Irkin Antonov, the director of the Russian culture, Vladimir Modinsky, the head of the department of culture, Alexander Kibowsky, and the deputy mayor of Moscow, Leonid Prettanikov.
Previously, it was reported that Ernest's relatives were planning to hold a pannyid on a sculptor in New York, allegedly until 14 August.
The final consumer was, who really buys the plates?
Single middle-aged men love blame.
And so far you have come to undermine the section of the comments with gross insults under the pseudonycid NEHOD, which is derived from the factual data.
According to YoGov, so much of the renaissance under discussion is due not to the boom of a generation of bi-months who want to enter a innovative material item but to the nostalgi of medium years.
Those who recently bought a wine album with a high probability of being between 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It's also not just an act of having lovers, it's emotional; the older customers are a little bit more likely to have their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% against 66%).
But are the results YoGov correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of the busy street of Soho, in a modest grey suit, and with a violent gesture in front of the stop, putting my hands together and saying something impressive like, "Yes, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops now filled up the buildings once occupied by independent vendors — several fantastic music shops still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and emotional moods by observation.
The U.S. Glasgow Stuart, 55 years old, followed by me from Sister Ray (calculated: two young women, three male middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculated: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London for a half-day meeting, and going shopping for hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, shown above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't chase him until home), go through the walls of his hotel.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy the plates he couldn't afford when they just got out and buy the items he sold when he was young and on small.
"Many of what I buy is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my fault.
Weas, 25 years old, who works in Sister Ray, also feels that many of the customers he meets correspond to the YouGov profile.
However, he noticed a new wave of people who were influenced by media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I have, people have been rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their blame to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their plates," he says.
This can explain the boom among the recovery figures that has been responsible for a certain age.
What about the perceived emotional importance of plastics?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phoenica to understand that plastic stores offer comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wesa, some older clients, inter alia, have been offended by a system of unpaid payment.
Some fans may be shocked by the digital world and prefer to remove familiar envelopes for plastics, objects that arouse memories of an unprecedented youth.
"I think that sometimes it might be filling up empty things or possessing material things as a kind of peace," says Weas.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's just a way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague at the plate ceiling.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of the players they never use, while 7% of the customers who buy wine don't have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked very excited, sung ceilings with the Bosanoves.
The "prophetic" aspect of regeneration is what Johnny has observed, 42 years old, who works in Sounds of the Unit (calculated to three middle-aged men).
"Someone came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
The larger part of the piece, the smaller the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a memory player."
They're younger people who are not older, they're a little less than twenty, they're just getting to know it.
Fopp, who's now taking away almost the entire floor of his guilt, a much more diverse audience when I'm coming.
There are couples who are in their 70s who take pictures, teenage boys and women in their middle years.
Although the atmosphere is less unenforceable than in the above-mentioned shops — the last synth and sex pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is tried through columns — it is a pleasure to see diversity in its clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a painful psychological trauma for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, spent a few minutes looking at the various sheets of sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She didn't earn much, she said, so it wasn't a very good option to collect the plates.
It's expensive.
To listen to music on a computer or another device is simple, but beauty is responsible for..." -- it's a dream with breath, full of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers responsible for: City fashioners.
As long as I create an illusion that I'm looking at gin and light shirts, I'm watching a group of adolescent girls meeting around the Polauid cameras every minute before my father and his daughter start talking about buying a Crossley player.
On the left is a ladder with a wall of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse and Flitwood Mack: a mixture of modern styles and classics binding plates for any middle collection.
No one watches — perhaps because they are simply ornaments — some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "detentional fault."
But given that any emphasis on these items can mean more money for the industry and can send several clients to Soho depths for a while, there's almost nothing to complain about.
It is no wonder that a layer of people with greater potential than most people have more time and money than most people have is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury goods, such as wine.
But as long as my findings show that YoGov results are accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they don't exclude the existence of a huge number of women collectors and lovers who are in reality, in plastic shops and online fora.
These people probably work at school or office.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday, walking through the stores of plastics on Bervik Street, a prolific plate, and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who hangs over his shoulders with nothing of any male middle-aged suspects.
The Greenlandic polar shark — the longest - lived vertebrate — video reports
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all the planet’s vertebrates.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record set the female age between 272 and 512 years and a length of 5 meters
The French court rejects the offer to dump the Jungle refugee camp stores
The French court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of improvised shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to remove a total of 72 improvised shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or outside dishes for several euros in home-based restaurants.
Kale Prefecture stated that those places must be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian teams have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that free dishes offered by the non-governmental association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lillah Court held that there was no legal basis for expelling 72-separate managers, but stated that the problems of Kale prefectures “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-Francoa Molla said that the bachelors, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions”.
He said that the space provided calm points for the refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the children ' s coffee book Jungle at the camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and a consultation on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort to the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that his closure “would have been a disaster for these children, some of whom were under eight years of age”.
Two charitable institutions, the refugees' aid and the L'Auberge des Mugrants estimated that the population in the Jungle camp had grown to more than 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in newcomers during the summer.
Micrograin libraries invite young people to educational programmes.
The filial library will hold meetings this week on City Day, Russian Film Year, and even Physicide Day.
Programmes were aimed at children, so most of them would be in play-based format.
Today, August 10, the filial library, No. 2, in an incendiary microreyone, invites us to the Cruise Presentation of "The Little Good."
"I live in this city, I know this town."
There will be a multimedia lesson at filial library No. 2 on the same day, "The Earth of the Past Judge."
And at filial library No. 4 in Suzrajek, a game program called "Film, Film."
On Sunday, 14 August, a video library program called "Fisk-H" will be run for the children of the Northern Micrograin.
Britain stops on silver in regbi-7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Rabi-7 was severely stopped at the final obstacle to the Fiji team's finals on Thursday night, when they were completely destroyed by 43-7 at Deodoro stage here in Rio.
Fiji was given a full-blown master class, with a ball, a sling, a sling, a game support, a line run, and a rough force to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came not too much comfort in the form of silver — the third silver in Britain for a day — and they were able to take pride in their efforts at the first Rabi-7 Olympic Tour, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on their way.
Bucks sick beating, 7-5 in semifinal earlier on the same day, could have come back to adversely affect them in the finish line.
But despite this, Fiji has won a team of 15 in this form as best as possible.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal tomorrow at the neck: Chief Coach, Fiji - Ben Ryan, former chief of England in Wimbldon.
It was some trip to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one in here.
These blows will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji was doing great, and for fun, it reflected the British's attempt to intercept the ball.
It was like coming across a convoy of buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the champions of the World Series went up 5-0 when Osea Colnisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes at Jerry Tuway's watch, another creek on the right flank was added.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempted interception of Mitchell had held Leon Nacarov's human being from losing third, but that only delayed Fiji.
For the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a cchdaun in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and more than an hour... in the first half.
Vatimo Ravo has then broken through several attempts at intercepting Britain and storming the line to get a point.
Implementation resulted in a suspension of 29-0.
It looked as if Fiji had been born to play Regby-7, while Great Britain still had a trade.
Which to a large extent is true.
Great Britain has done half of the game, and they bought Fijian dam... for four minutes, which was good for the first half until Joshua Tusov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton seized the attempt to make a cachdown at the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was long on the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving their flags and dancing on the pods.
It was impossible to admire the full joy of Fiji’s approach.
Her mother, William, caught up with Fijian cake, which did not need to be painted, another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle was heard, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the lawn, totally defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and Great Britain had salved South Africa a little in a tense semifeeding of one attempt — the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Bucks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line by some magnificent work of his legs and hit him at the points in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother 15 to team in England, Anthony, won — and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanley were inspired to win the dam of a coach and cancer.
There won't be any more globular gold on these games, and that says something about it.
From the first movement to the last, 220 hard ups in history, Helen Glover and Hyser Stanley found additional significance for their golden moment on Estoio da Lagoa.
Even though they were the two who held their oars, there were three voices in this boat, Coach Robina Williams' echo was always as long as they sought for the second round of Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in British sports analysts who reached this height.
Their superiority was absolute, and at the end of the day, it was their 39th undeniably speaking, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes, sliding across the surface with the elegance of the winch, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For each gold, the battalion of finished hands, which contribute to the gradual gains of importance, and there were no hands that were more important than the coach's hands, which 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would survive before he saw that day.
He said it was a dangerous thing.
I had a urine bubble cancer, which is one of the things that they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
That might have been a pretty bad situation.
She changes your species a little bit to the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 in an intersezone, keeping the schedule gap minimal if that could be the correct expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I had to go fast.
It was an incentive.
I went to hospital and went to the hospital — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they were talking a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The dam in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
The next moment, after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent his nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little bit too much, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much this means to me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Richard Stanley didn't lose a single race in five years.
This couple is setting up a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much stock.
We were in the phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved now.
We had a good start, but at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to go out and win this race, which we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with a TV sparker of adventure by Steve Blackwall.
Now she wants to just enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this is my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become the Olympic Championship.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government has extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited by entering Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev and published at an official legal information portal.
The embargo against the countries that had imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been repeated and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
Food imports into the country are being disposed of in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sale.

There are rains and storms waiting for Friday in Moscow.
The capital region will have an atmospheric front that will bring rainfall and air temperature down.
The air heats up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] in the day.
For example, the night of Saturday in Moscow will be a short-term rain, possible storms and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with storms and winds up to 12-17 m/s.
The rains are also predicted in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronje regions, reports “Dani.ru”.
Next work week, rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO arbitrators' panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The rates of entry are higher than those assumed by Russia upon accession to WTO.
“This is the first case in which WTO has decided against the Russian Federation” is stated in the communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures had been “systematic” or“ comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is described in a report by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to be welcomed to the World Trade Organization for the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is referred to in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that U.S. conduct in resolving disputes in WTO undermines the organization's discussion principles.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members owing to the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term by the South Korean judge Chan Sang Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia acceded to it in 2012.
The president was replaced
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the former Deputy Deputy Iwanova Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out re-locations to the administration of the President and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun as President Ivan's head of administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, Ivedia wrote that experts have considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the head of the administration as transparent and clear and repositioning rather than as a fundamental change in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They point out that the manager, who had been working for a long time in the administration of the President, had effectively built up the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Wyno, who is a man who is well aware of the specificity of this work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gaspropam.
The State Polish oil and gas company PGNG does not exclude that within a few years gas supply from the Russian Federation may not become attractive to it because of the reliance on fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Boslaw Majetz.
His words are being delivered to the TAS.
"Maybe we're not going to buy gas at all (Gazpropam), we're now diversifying our supply.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, LNG-terminal raw materials and Norway,” said the Majec.
Gazprom is now dominated by the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that a Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 gave it almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas, an increase of 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The Russian gas giant ' s share of PGNG ' s procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent earlier.
We recall that on 22 July, the Polish anti-monopoly department did not agree on the establishment of the Gasprom joint venture and its European gas pipeline partners, “North Flow-2”.
However, Poland had previously left a request for Gasprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas for the North Stream-2.
A statement was made by the Vice-President of the Holding Board, Alexander Medvedev.
The “North Flow 2” auction will take place in 2017 and, in the autumn of 2016, the auction will be held on its cover.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to act on the Polish side's intentions to refuse long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, declared the Vice-President of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The Garsprom Castle added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG applied to the Stockholm Court of Arbitration does not yet mean an end to the negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company had appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gasprom contract for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could, within six years, refuse to supply blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas, Baltic Pepe, which would link the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The “North Flow-2” provides for the construction of two threads of sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (MSM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first head of the SMM in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, responding to the relevant question of journalists, conveys the RIA News.
According to OSCE, there are no security incidents at the border of Ukraine and Crimea.
The observers monitored the events at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukraine border.
The Network had a video of a Jaco-42 passenger aircraft landing at Wef Airport that had run out of the airstrip by 400 m and had collapsed on the left wing.
The video has published a 360 television channel.
The PP occurred in 430 Moscow time.
Croasvia arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft left for parking.
Wefa's airport is in normal mode.
The FAC ' s slave transport investigation office was informed of the reasons for the rigid landing of a liner aircraft.
The United Nations investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The United Nations Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel areas in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Misura, considers that the case has been incontrovertible.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syria talks, to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists began investigations into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas terrorist attack allegedly caused by chlorine appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that, in the area of the previous day, a Russian military aircraft helicopter had been bombed, but in Moscow these charges were called a misdemeanour.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group of Harakat Nur Al-Din al-Zinka.
It soon became known that the toxic gas bombs were two.
This confirmed the BBC as one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the beginning of my eyes, the difficulty of breathing," quotes the eyewitness's remarks.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized as a result of the attack.
If the use of poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, acts will be regarded as a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Misour said to journalists: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot”.
The non-acceptability of use of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine used by the Syrian army against the “dead opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo makes it difficult for its areas to be shelled every day and terrorists to prevent residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of the daily three-hour delay in the organization is deemed to be “not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Jan Egeland, Humanitarian Adviser Staffan de Mistura, stated that a 48-hour cease-fire would be required to bring relief and evacuation from the city for the sick and wounded every week.
“We have to send goods from a convoy of trucks in a place where the roads are practically destroyed and the ones left are mined," said Mr. Egeland, "but the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit at our negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened the "human windows" at Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing struggle for Aleppo - the second largest Syrian city - Russia on 11 August announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place on a daily basis from Thursday.
The establishment of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the transport of medicines, food and essential supplies to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow, demanding that the military operation be terminated and that the negotiating process be resumed.
As a result of a series of explosions at Thai resorts, four people were killed.
At once, several explosions were recorded in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed, 19 wounded.
The explosion epicenter came to Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, citizens of four States, were affected, and there were no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups have yet to take responsibility for the incident, but the country's MWI has hurriedly declared that the Islamists have not been involved.
Several individuals have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police indicate the scale and characteristics of the explosions that they were directed against the lead country.
The attacks occurred in popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the city of Hua-Hin, Ting and Surat Tani.
Following the rise of the military Hutu in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks had already been arrested, reports Colonel Krysana Patanacharoen of the police.
While it was too early to talk about the purpose, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, “the countries are convinced that they are not connected with international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local movements, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The blasts took place on the birthday of Queen Sistrit of Thailand.
The Thai hunta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to a statement by the general police general Stichchia Sripapacarenrat, the bombs were bombed remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with food at restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The other victims were not yet known, but were known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Thai Royal Police, of these four Germans, three Dutch subjects, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russian victims of the bombings, reports the Rosurism press service.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the 7 August referendum, at which 61.4% of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution commission appointed by the military Hutu.
It had to be determined whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in electing the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the army of Prajua Chan-Ocha.
In that step, he said, the army had risen up the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and unleashed protestors and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok is in emergency situation
The Thai Government, headed by Prime Yingla Chinawat, announced in January 2014 a state of emergency in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The special regime has extended for 60 days.
Like two bombings in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two bombings occurred in the centre of Bangkok at the time of the victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The blasts were made by people who were unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital city and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
Conditions began to be developed in Such Logue.
As the “Kill” has become known, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft conditions for the auction on the gold mine of Suhoi Log, with two key restrictions.
It is proposed that the auction should not allow companies where 25 per cent or more belong to foreigners and those applicants whose capital is not at least 25 per cent of the State party.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite conditions, noting that many players do not risk taking on a difficult and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and will be held in October.
The Ministry of Environment has introduced a draft order and conditions for auction to the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Sukhi Log (Irkutsk region, stocks and resources - 130 million ounces) and has provided two sources of “Occto” familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, clarifying one of them.
In the Ministry, the draft was confirmed as being submitted to the Government.
The representative of the smoker, prime minister, Alexander Cotronine, said "Kill" that the official had not yet received the project.
“The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and taking into account the time period for the selection of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can take place in October” said in Minsk.
According to “Summ,” the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants in the version, which was sent to the agreement between ministries and FOVI in July (this is the “Opto”).
The first is the existence of at least 25 per cent of the total of applicants in the capital.
The second is denial of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors, on the basis of the understanding of FZ-57 of innovation in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the draft FZ, as it had already written on 2 August, the auction may prevent companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Suja Logue is of a federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
In Min Nature, the project “holds restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on details before government orders.
The auctioner's capital requirement was put forward by Irkutsk, speaking in December 2015 as “Kill” in Minsk and confirmed later by the Governor of the region, Sergey Levenco, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Serge Eršenko, “who had an investment agreement with Rothech”.
Whoever lobbyed for the admission of aliens, the interviewers "Illust" make it clear.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to control the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," is the interviewor, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Environment, Sergey Donne, stated on 1 August that foreigners “can go into a consortium” if the applicants attract them “as a financial structure, as technological partners”.
The Knoth interlocutors consider it unlikely that the Government will adjust the conditions.
The main claimant in Sukhi Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest PAO gold producer, Polus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimam Saidu, and Rascha.
As Perchul put it, in July partners set up the SP Golden, where 51% of the shares are in the RT-R-R-R-R-49%.
In "Rustech", the comments were rejected, in Polsa stated as “a message” that “unquestionably, the asset is interested in it” and has all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions” added to the “Police”.
ALROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision of the Russian Federation government has been made by the sources of “Done”.
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotkok, were said to be involved in the development of the Sohogo Loga, while Polymal and Nordold, according to the column, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industry of the RF, Sergey Kashuba, in December 2015, assessed the “Dad” investment in Suja Log in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants have been released not only by the volume of investment but also by the complexity of the project: the need for a serious survey of stocks and technology in complex ore, explain the “Col” interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest transaction M&A - “CET Finance Pension Administrator” launched a process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, a total of around 373 billion roubles will be created by the Retirement GasF.
The launch of the consolidation procedure for four pension funds - KTT Finance, Promrogrofund, Inheritance and GasFed Pension Stockpiling - yesterday informed the owner 100 per cent of the GSC funds of the Pension Administrator.
“Reorganization is undertaken in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-agrement of the terms of the existing contracts”, says the company's report.
The association shall be based on the GasFund of Pensions.
As this NPF generator points out, Oleg Bávezitzka, a combination of funds can accomplish several tasks: expanding the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing the costs, reproducing the best practices of each fund and streamlining corporate governance.
He said that the period for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of NPF, Gasfund Pensions will be the largest player in the SFOR market.
As of 31 March, the amount of pension savings in the pooled funds exceeded roubles of roubles.
According to the accounts on the stock website, the beneficiaries of their owner, “CICT Finance Pension Administrator”, are now Anatoly Gavrilenco (with the OOs controlled 65 per cent) and GasF “Gazfund” (35 per cent).
However, the group itself had launched much later on.
Thus, an O1 NPF-controlled "The Future" group swallowed the Stalfund back this year.
The Joint NPF now joins the Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“Unifying, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for structural tasks”, notes NPF Creator of the Future, Nicholas Sidorov.
Intensive work on fund consolidation has been taking place since April in the Safmar-NPF “European”, Education and Science, and in the religious fund, to be part of Safmar's NPF before the end of the year.
They will be joined by the NPF Trust in 2017.
“Funding of funds will result in increased control over risk, transactional processes and expenditures”, noted Safmar's pension group.
There are several reasons for the delay in the pooling of funds that KITT 'Finance of the Pension Administrator', which may be caused by the experts.
Until recently, NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds to which the group was actively located.
Following amendments to the CB Order in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of patents that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue may buy one large player,” says the director of the AKRA Financial Institute rating team, Yury Nogin.
Several heads of NPF from top 15 to the asset, another possible cause of the pause, refer to the separation of the sphere of influence and, as a consequence, to personnel appointments in a single fund that the owners of the group had to agree on.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenco was not available for comment.
No response was also made to the "HazF" request from the NPF.
While consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and non-cost-intensive exercise, this decision will be justified on a long distance.
As the originator of the Pensionary Partnership consulting company, Sergey Okolesnov, points out, the Department of Pension Stockpiling has less waste and accession will help stabilize the team's other funds.
This will require more successful NPF experience of KITT Finance and Promagrofund in the production of SPS retail sales, as well as the use of more modern software.
The requirements of the CB for processes and personnel of the NPF are increasing, so to duplicate the infrastructure on four foundations with a single investment policy would not be appropriate, considering Paul Mitrovov, director of the corporate ratings of the Expert RA.
“An effect from the reduction of duplicate functions will definitely overlap the possible costs of integration”, notes Mr. Mitrovov.
The cost of combining four funds by Sergei Okolesnov is estimated to be 30-50 million roubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles per year, when the budget is consolidated in the medium term, is sure to be halved by Mr. Okolesnov.
The Russian space shuttle made the best D.C. "P. and his dragon" movie.
New Zealand's beautiful species, the smartest dragon, the soul-whelming history and the song in the backyard are enough to believe once again in old-fashioned magic, thinks EENNA CRIK.
A frightened child was picked up by a dragon that became a human child and a gentle nurse and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after a cup of fairy tales, playing with him and sleeping in his arms.
Six years later, he was thrown over, and in a feign ligament, no longer distinguished from another thought - of - Maulli.
In the form of Pita, she discovers a red-headed woman, Geyce (Breis Dallas Howard), while the Guinea brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively driving the forest.
Now she'll have to not only believe that there is a dragon, she'll have to help save it.
Pete's an accelerated course of "be human" in the neighborhood of idilian Americans, who are wearing cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart, and smiles more blindly than any ad.
No character looks or acts too bad to actually start to hate him or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has been hunting for a non-standard native of his own forests, is far from an insatiable thief.
A huge, furry dragon, too, proved to be far from frightening, with a good shell, an airline - shaped wing, and a potential for being invisible.
Dragons are fun to learn, ant tore, and fortunately, they don't say that he's always trying to make it work, and that's a good thing that he's different from all of the famous film dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of maintaining such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most stressful moments, it is a desperate cry in three arms not only of young spectators but of adults as well.
Amazingly good and young Oux Figley is the role of Pit, which breaks between a family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtualizing a canonical grandfather whom he would be pleased to have literally every child.
How did film director David Lowry manage to remove a fantastically cute film from the dysfunctional "Dacon Pit" film of 1977, which was the middle of the nose to the tip of the tail, only remembered by a moment of play film animation, and to make it the most emotional film this summer?
Not unless the miracle helped.
In his painting, Lois actually took only two things: Pit's orphan and dragon.
There were music numbers and most strange jokes on board.
It's a good story that contains features from the Bambi, the Inoplanetian, and many other lovely hearts of children's paintings.
The stage of the Disney continues to expand well the gallery of high-quality belts of the twenty-first century.
Of course, Pete and the dragon aren't as amazing as the Book of the Jungle, and it doesn't have the creative villain that Keith Blanchett was like a stepmother in the new Word.
But this naive movie is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best of the dysnic traditions.
By the way, the keys from the magic castle of the Dissemble director Lowy will be re-done for the artistic filming of the story of "Pierre Pene".
"Pit and His Dragon" by David Lowrey and the writer Toby Halbrux entered a new ambitious project on a non-accommodating boy on James Barry's story.
Journalist Alexander Socolow is being charged with new charges
Lawyers from RBC journalist Alexander Socolova, accused of organizing extremist activities, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found fault in the case of their defender.
That the Public Prosecutor's Office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We have been scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of the limitation of the criminal case, but no meeting has been held in the end, and the investigators have informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office”, giving the LBK the words of counsel Olga Dinza.
She said that the Public Prosecutor's Office had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were inconsistent.
Investigators will now have to resolve the gaps in the evidentiary base and bring a new charge to Alexander Socon.
In either case, another article of the Criminal Code (UK) will either remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze points out.
As Alexander Sokol reported, he was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the charge a journalist from the RBC from the words “decenting the political environment towards instability” and “possessing the authority illegally”.
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, a co-respondent in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian assembly house, lunched at the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life is dying here for a second.
Even at night.
The last few startups sometimes end at midnight, and the athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, villages and evictions are not stopped, as some athletes complete their statements and leave Brazil, and some only arrive here on the contrary.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympian delegations are held in a temporary tent.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, and the head of the sports delegation of Russia's Olympic Command, Igor Kazikov, says that despite the fact that the house where we live, we think the model was one of the first and showed all the inspectors, even though there are some faults.
It's with hot water, so I'm sorry, with toilets.
We've been fighting for cleanliness.
Just didn't come out first.
And then the Kliners came in, but they just put some substance on the floor, and that's all.
The floors of them, you see, are kind of innovative.
You can't wash them human.
We know these fields, they're just ordinary.
Generally, the Klinger Company has been replaced and now it's all OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Botvo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, with a plumbing rudder, a place filled with water.
And for security, there's a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter along which the automotives walk.
The village could accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
In one of the 18-strated buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is fully assigned to the needs of our assembly.
When you look at the small foy at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems seem to be most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the balance of the registration: "Please, don't throw the paper into the toilet" and the hand "Present the badge."
The stamina itself drowns in tracts.
Their seductive bloom contrasts with the headlines of the brochures, entitled “An Immulated Diseases for De Janeiro”, “First Assistance With Utopia, Isolation in the Occupying Road, Familiar Reeds,” “First Aid for Burns, Warm Hits, Cuts, and Hemorrhages”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not all will expect a favorable outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre located in the Russian prefabricated region, which is willing at any time to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massages.
Against the medical centre, my delegation's own headquarters.
A inspiring poster near the door, "No matter what, we'll win."
And of course, poems are:
All the arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let the smaller of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, the greater Russia will not retreat, the less shall not be broken.
And for a greater spirit, a declaration is made: "Dear brothers and sisters!
Following the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Rusie Kirill, the Olympic collecting athletes are given spiritual care by Andrey Vladimirvich Alexev.
You can order a child and other needs on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and religious observances for all denominations in the village.
Well, the Russians, they get privileged -- they have their own timer.
With the elevator being loaded from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to descend on the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, I ran into the bodies that were lying upon her.
It seems that they were the sleeping staff members of the new Klinge Company.
I believe that at any point in their willingness to throw themselves into a washing of innovative sex, they decided to make themselves quiet for the rest of the time in the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting to meet an old acquaintance, Vitali Fedoric Dubko, a coach of our Batutians, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
With a boy, Jan Paul’s champion of Europe, he kindly agreed to show his rooms.
It's not a big deal to complain about, but it's not critical to living by two.
Sanousel one on the four, but he's too simple.
The scarf, of course, is funny, the fabric doesn't make trust, but things can be put in.
"No, you're pretending that their tea's over!" and hand-wandering the tennisist Svetlan Kuznetsov, who I met in the main dining room.
Its main name is at least because it represents an space of 27,000 square metres and is ready to be accepted at the same time by 5,000 visitors.
There are 60,000 daily servings that are completely free of charge.
Menu options are as follows: “Best of Brazil”, “The World’s Cereams”, “Asia dish” and “Pits, pasta”.
The latest option, as I've watched, is very popular with our volleyballers.
And I'm saying, I didn't find any soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What soup?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, too bad.
And the teapot.
But to make you understand, we have even worse food on our backs.
There's something you can choose in spite of the inexorable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a couple of pieces and a couple of meats in a tomato soot.
A plate with each dish has its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value and the availability of allergens.
Yeah, well, I'm sure I did.
I don't know why that line costs all the time at the local McDonald's.
The grays, the relaxed, can be said to be the warm athletes on their way out of the restaurant, feeding our best friends, representatives of the World Antiping Agency (WADA).
It's a faggot who's winning a T-shirt.
They're being provoked, you can say!
To get a gift, you must answer at least eight of the ten questions.
- I've been attacked by a young woman from WADA.
But I didn't.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic breakdown, of course.
The situation was already on the second question: "If I received notification of Doping Control, should I immediately enter Doping Control?"
I stopped at Option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, that's to say, vigilance.
I forgot you didn't have to wait for the holddown from WADA.
Anyway, I need to be right there.
And in phase seven, my position was critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I found it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and, I think, it's hard!), I could use biodoctures to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, it's not!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in a way that is not categorically prohibited, but that urges, in several sentences, to be rejected.
It's not fair to play WADA!
Well, how's it going, Russia?
It's no way to get back to Efimova, Issibaev, and our entire underworld team.
So I focused and out of the last forces, I won an unfortunate T-shirt.
Know what ours say!
In a winning mood, I got into the phytines centre of the neighborhood.
Learn how to count the coaches.
He hit 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete was found in this threat of escape tracks.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play play practice!
And there's one of our guys sitting in the nearby clinic.
It's in line for the eye specialist.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, like all over the village, where there is no ivy, it hangs condoms.
Therein he is inspired by the cry, "Separate with the horse."
The next thing to do is to twist the gland that resembles the handle of the door lock, and the condom made of the Amazon natural latex is willing to fall out of the machine.
I took myself alone, to remember.
The athletes did not leave, and they were taken 450,000.
For the celebration and celebration of the Olympic village, there is a whole entertainment centre.
On the other hand, there is an informative tablet, reminding the International Olympic Committee of a variety of ways to spend $3.25 million a day on athletes.
The centre is inspired by video games, mobile and tennis tables, desktop football and hockey, and some weird-looking video-readers.
- I'm interested in a Ukrainian teammate who's actively using a savage toy.
You could just say, of course, that you don't want to talk to a person in the form of a bona fide Russia, and that's all.
Here, by the way, the circumstances are strange in the eyes of the boys in yellow blue.
The most playable collection, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to walk around the village.
But if you walk, not on electric carts, you'll be able to open up a Canadian collection room with a elk in the entrance and the shuttle with a replacement bath, a ticket office, a laundry, a laundry, a chimp-cleaning, a paint shop, a daily store, a mail with unique stamps (only you can't wait in Chinese philate) and a bank, a revenue office, and a photoquick.
And later in the evening, you, the promising man, will sit next to an olive tree that has been adorned with colorful tapes to remember the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left the world.
And you're going to be under the accompaniment of a machine that's indiscriminately spraying fluid to kill insects, to think about forever.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
So far, the rest of the Russian world has been following how the Australians almost ordered the American Dream Team, the real fans have gone online.
Few people know that the news is that Inna Deriglaze won the gold in the rapier on the X21 Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who saw this happen -- not thinking of the people who were watching Carioca competition that night.
It can only be understood by a real fan.
For example, the deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors down here -- as always at night -- wake up and start to cry at each other in a blouse.
And threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen there's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
There's nothing wrong with the television schedule, so I was just holding up on the Master's, the Peri and in the case of Russia, although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, and all the sports are there for some reason on record.
The TV shows are broadcast.
Hope, of course, at Matt's, a young man was shouting in the news releases first about the great Partyglaze-Shanaev, and then about the next battle for gold.
It makes sense to show you.
But instead, basketball is the United States-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half of all won.
They put the U.S. Americans on the site of their own greatness.
As a result, they have lost, but as they say, the basketball Olympics will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but it's about the fight with Dee Franczyk, and it's on the screen without change.
I'm starting to send channels in a light panic.
It feels like it, it's being played for a second time.
All right, let's go deep down to the cables.
There's no such thing as "Matachey" fencing on any of the topical "Match".
And I feel like the battle is about to begin.
I'm not happy with the text and TV broadcasts of some sports sites.
The ship's surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the "First" website, it appears, a direct technical transmission of all the contests that take place at that time.
I'm calling for fencing, getting a friend for the gold.
Dr. Harris: Dr. Harris: It's a very good match, it's going forward, and it's obviously starting to take a while.
It's a Italian who plays almost all the distance.
We're just one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
De Francesca is throwing himself on Derrigazov, but retreats, time is running out, and Italians are throwing a shot.
Win!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Massinger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first person to see it with his eyes.
The fools, the faithful, the ones involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (MLM) of Tatars refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the prisoner of the DJM forced his imams to preach Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to “understand their mother tongue”.
It is claimed by the management that this “neither violates” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some of Kazani mosques, it is estimated that Tatars do not understand up to 60 per cent of people, including foreign students, migrants and the Tartarians themselves.
Imams fear that their preaching in Tatar “will not reach the whole audience”.
Yesterday, the M.D. Tatars unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar only.
According to Muftstan Tattarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “understand their mother tongue”.
"For those who say it's hard," in every large mosque, we intend to organize a lesson in the Tatar language completely free of charge," Mr. Smyculin promised.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques, preach “should be in Tatar.”
He recalled that the Tartarstan DM was publishing a magazine entitled “Sura” with model sermons in Tatar.
Imams who don't speak very well in Tatar, "can get ready."
MSA Tatarstan is bringing together more than a thousand arrivals in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to muftia, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Russian was used mainly in Kazanian in a number of mosques.
In particular, according to the mufties, it was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, he stressed that the leadership was working to ensure that all students could speak both State languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
“Neither the abuse of non-Tattar Muslims can be attributed to speech,” stressed Mr. Mahametshin, explaining that the sermon itself “is not a mandatory, essential part of the pump.”
In doing so, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons will remain in Russian in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mahametshin said that there was no serious threat of moving the Tatar language out of the mosque.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, it is reported that there is no use in the preaching work in the Republic.
The decision of the CMM was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress of the Tatars (CTED).
The director of the CTO, Rytnut Zikirov, said, "I'm sorry, I'm sure you're a good part of our national life."
It would be sad if Tatars were to leave this area.
He noted that it was only the Tatar language “the wish of the imams itself,” but in WCP’s workbook, “it was considered correct”.
The Imams interviewed by the Imma, who preached in Russian, are prepared to implement the decision of the CMM, but believe that there will be difficulties in understanding the clergy.
They go to the mosque, both the Tartars and the Russians.
Many don't understand the language.
They'll, of course, be dumb.
"There's going to be a shift," says the Imams of the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that even a large number of Tatars could preach in Russian, since “russian, schools and children, on the radio, on the original radio”.
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which were held in other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show the way out of this situation, and he has concluded.
But about 60 percent of us don't know Tatar.
It's both Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've moved in Russian for four years," he says to the imams.
He believes that in Tatar, the sermons will “come to a narrower circle and not reach the whole audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It'll just be another thing.
But time will show.
"I, for example, will only be easier because Tatar is my native language," concluded Gabdul Galiullin.
The former director of the FSIN was put to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in the Criminal Investigation Unit of the Russian Federation against the misappropriation of the budget allocated to the FSIN.
Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion roubles, will be brought before the court.
The Capital Prosecutor's Office has sent criminal cases to the Zamszkvorc City Court against the former Director of the Russian Federation, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolaa Krvolapova, and the Director of the FGO, the Information Technology and Liaison Centre of the Federal Enforcement Service (TFOC) of Viktor Project.
Depending on the role and degree of involvement in the crime, they are accused of the GCC in Moscow under article 3 of article 285 of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with grave consequences), article 4, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (mandatory by virtue of their official position, within an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krvolalopov is charged under article 1 of article 222 of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CCS, in 2010-2012, the persons concerned were fraudulently kidnapped from the State treasury of the budget allocated to the FSIN to provide an agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons called electronic papers.
To embezzlement the budget, the team developed a scheme whereby the TITSG-controlled enterprise, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced the technical means of monitoring and oversight, including “electronic bracelets”, and was priced at several times overstated.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings, facilities to accommodate production capacity to establish a completed cycle of “electronic bracelets”, five hospital bills worth more than 3.3 billion roubles have been concluded between the CITAP and the Russian FSIN.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were recorded in the accounts of the Samoan branch, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a consequence, more than 140 million roubles of cash have been received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office office from one of the accomplices, for whom criminal proceedings have been set aside for separate proceedings.
Nikolaa Krvolopaov, who was involved in the frauds, found an unknown origin of a cartridge to a prize gun, allowing him to be further charged.
In this case, which was 133 volumes, the FSIN against the accused filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion roubles.
The Futballist Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in a mutch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player, followed by a member of the Parliament, Hakan Schukühr, and searched two houses of his family.
The hive of Turkish football in the 1990s, the early 2000s, the attacker Hakan Shukur is sought by the authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état that took place last month.
Forvard, which ended the sports career in 2008, is accused of being part of a “armed terrorist group”.
It is a society linked to a well-known Turkish religious leader and opposition to Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan who co-vens an attempt at a coup d ' état on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur has been issued, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes owned by the former footballian family.
According to an investigation, his father joined Fethollah Galen, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, there was no former football player or his loved ones there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated the assembly country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasarea.
There are Italian "Torino," Inter, and Palermo, as well as English, Blackburn.
True, none of them had more than one season.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective in attacking Turkey, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 hits.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy office because of the corrupt investigation that had begun around the Erdogan party and its nearest environment.
According to a Turkish newspaper, at least 42 journalists were issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of promoting a coup d'état and of associating with an opposition Islamic preacher, Fetholah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, the media can wait for extended prison terms, from 10 years to several life sentences.
Hisr Conchalovsky wants to set up a network of movie theaters only for domestic films.
“I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian film, with tickets worth two to three times as much as for foreign films”, he said.
Mr. Conchalovsky notes that Russian films find it difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings per year, of which 20 to 25 cents of them reach the screens.
"And even they're very hard to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man who have huge budgets to advance," said the filmmaker.
Recall, on 1 July, the All-Russia Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from across Russia and a number of countries of close concern and distance.
The British won Olympic gold in the academic dam in doubles.
The British Greeks, Helen Glover, and Richard Stanley won the Olympic gold in the academic dam in the two.
They took Rebecca Scoun and Genevieve Beren, New Zealand, the third seat occupied by Anne Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark.
I'm not sure it's the new genius who promises to pass Zenit Aren by 26 December.
A new producer of the St. Petersburg stadium, who is expected to take over the 2017 Cup of Confederations and the 2018 World Cup, the Metrostrom promises to rent the arena by 26 December, reports the RIA News, with reference to the Head of the Provisional Commission of the Federation Council for the Preparation of the World Cup for soccer Cup-2018, Vadima Tulipanova.
"So afternoon, with the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitali Mutko, we visited the building site, and we were with Vadim Alexandra, the genitor of Metrostros.
He said he'd surrender the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Pyerburg company, it never breaks the deadline.
Vitali Mukoko and I have remained happy and heard," quote the interviewer's agency.
Vitali Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the location of the next large-scale competition.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that the Sovfeld Commission under his leadership would continue to monitor progress in the construction of the stadium and visit the construction site on a regular basis.
It was recalled yesterday that Metrostrom was about to complete the construction of Zenith-Arenna, the contract price of about 5.4 billion roubles, the same company had won trades for the improvement of territory around the stadium, the value of the contract was 2.4 billion roubles; the contracts with the AO of Transstro's Corporation, the OO of the Engineering Corporation of Transstro-Sbb and the IE of the Engineering Corporation of Transstroy were terminated.
Two more companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more information on the choice of the new gene contractor, see "The Metrostrostros" in the "Metrostros" field.
In Misas, in the Czech Region, counsel for former vice-motor Nikolay Sandakov Konstan Akulic was detained.
Another accused's lawyer, Sergey Kolosski, reported that Constantine Akuklica was today summoned to the investigation office of the CSR Misas to charge the prosecution of one year's crime of beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulik was on his way to the scene of the incident as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally brought against unknown individuals, and now that he began to defend Nikolay Sandakova, it turned out to be Akulich," says Sergey Kolosowski.
Constantine Akulich became a lawyer for the Governor's ex-employer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer was called to the CSR Misas, the defence party was informed that on Monday the time limit would be for an examination of the fraud case in which Nikolay Sandakova was accused.
Remember, two criminal cases have been initiated against Nikolay Sandakov.
As part of the first fraud case, he is subject to a promise of 1.5 million roubles to facilitate the appointment of the Mayor of Magnetigoorsk, Head of Administration, Lake Eugania Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the PPOP Director, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal donation of property services amounting to at least 1.3 million roubles.
For details on Mr. Sandakov's case, please read "The New Revoke Governor Demands Uniting."
The Russian Medical Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and to focus more on the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the PMC has undertaken to modernize one of the country's oldest and environmentally friendly “polluting” enterprises, the Carabasa Medical Coke.
The Carabasa Medical Plant was founded by an English equity society headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise relevant to the economy, and it actually provided a whole city's livelihood.
However, in the 1990s, because of financial constraints, production was stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Carabashe.
In 1998, it was decided that the Karabasa Mederiga would resume operation.
One of the main problems of the Carabas plant was also to be addressed - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had already been known as an ecological disaster.
The situation in Carabashme began to change in 2004, after the enterprise moved under the control of the Russian Medical Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced environmental pressures on the environment.
This has recently been pointed out by the Governor of the Czech Region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Carabasme in the first few days of July.
The head of Southern Urala has described the massive changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Carabasme moved to the RMK group.
The main activity for the modernization of Carabasmed in recent years has been the construction of a new series of serenes to capture up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgy gases.
According to President of the Russian Medical Company, the total investment in the project was around 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of upgrading the Carabasmed PA is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of the three converters, impursors, and the gas tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial effluent treatment chain with a value of 1 billion roubles.
In turn, there will be an increase in the amount of taxes allocated to the budget of the city of Carabas.
Over the entire period of the Tominian GOC project, from the start of construction and until the second turn into operation, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Once GOC has been introduced into the budgets of all levels, there may be 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varnen district, budgets at different levels are listed at 346.3 million roubles.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise works, the more the amount can be," added Valery Ulanovsky.
In the RCM, it was specified that in 2015 tax contributions from the Micaevian GOC were close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RCC enterprises in the life and development of the Territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The FMC facilities help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and to maintain the territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Medical Company in Carabas was the major renovation and, in fact, the restructuring of the N9 kindergarten by 95 inmates.
A building built in 1960 was in emergency condition.
Also, a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports stores will be located on the ground.
The RMK Arena will allow for outstanding professional sports events at the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the inhabitants of Chelabinsk, especially to children.

WSJ: The US is considering the imposition of sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the hacking of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the entry of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the U.S. President Barack Obama is reportedly required to formally accuse the Russian authorities of an attack on the Russia servers or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American special services are almost convinced of Russia’s involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to mention those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the broken-up database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, for which the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree facilitating the imposition of sanctions against those who implement or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China but could be used against other countries as well.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, produces a publication.
Even if officials concluded that hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision to disclose information.
They have to determine whether a serious accident is so severe that it exacerbates tensions in bilateral relations.
It has been reported earlier that Barack Obama ' s administration allows sanctions to be imposed against the State whose hackers hackers hacked the Democratic Party Committee ' s servers.
Wikipedia's website published an electronic correspondence of the National Committee of Democratics.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in hackering.
In Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
Google FAS was fined by almost half-milliard ruble
The reason was a breach of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the Yandex initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited prepositioning of applications from other developers, such as the Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that it abused the dominant market position and forced mobile devices manufacturers to install other applications along with Google Play.
Following an audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reported to FAS leader Alexei Docenko.
The penalty must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that competition protection law must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then determine whether to perform it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the competition law back in September last year and ordered the amendment of the contracts until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, the possibility of a peace agreement with Google was discussed.
This will not lead to anything.
That view of the "Ehu Moscow" was expressed by the leading analyst Mobile study group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtasin also noted that a fine would not affect the users or competitors of a corporation.

Animé effect is criticized as a cartoon on Asians
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by an anim, but some experts say it's racially useless.
The Snapsa Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with the individual ways that border the absurd.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a character to stand up for Roy Liechtenstein.
Linsa is a gross, distorting tool that produces more than 30 million refrigerated selphs a day.
Any mistakes quickly become known.
Snapachat has been criticized in the past when they were charged that the annex had advertised a dark skin of a person or encouraged a white person as an ideal of beauty.
So when some of the users of this week offered a lens that gave them greasy eyes with teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics considered it a racist cartoon on Asians, a yellowist.
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions were pointing to the larger problem of the company's diversity problem.
Reports and complaints were distributed on Wednesdays on The Verge and the Mytherboard, the day after Snapachat stated that it had been taken away.
The company commented: the lens was designed to respect animium characters, not cartoons on Asians.
But experts who know of racism without audibly recalled the offensive stereotypes of action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with animia.
In an electronic letter by Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art who had been actively divided about photographs, said that the lyses were “prehensive and at least awkward”.
She added that "it was hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellows, it's highly destructive.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the deway that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapachat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to have an understanding.
When one of Snapschat's laziness creates an image that is offensive to the user, then she said in an interview on Thursday 25-year-old Katy Joo, "that's the course of events it's much harder to stay unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, Jo, product manager and engineer working on Medium decided to delete their account record at Snapchat and called on others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she felt that racial contradictions were the cause of a lack of diversity in the recruitment of personnel in Snappchat.
The jury found out mainly the white management of a company made up of men and ended its article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Joo, who is an American Chinese of his own: “There were not enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, nor do they have white people, but they do not hold positions where they can speak safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her point of view by disheartening that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to the trustee, the company had recently recruited a director to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively attempt to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Jo said that she would keep her record at Snapchat closed, adding, "I'm wondering if they really need more users like us to tell them they won't go that way."
Military leadership has distorted the intelligence of ISIS, reports the Congress Commission
The U.S. Central Command personnel modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the events on the ground gave rise to a report issued on Thursday by the Congress Commission.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairmans of the Committee of the House of Representatives for the BC, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Subcommittee found “extreme grievances” among the intelligence analysts of the Central Command, who claim that the leaders have guided their evaluation of American actions to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command known as Centko is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The exploration documents approved by the Centcoma High Command generally provided a more optimistic picture of anti-terrorism actions by the United States than confirmed by actual data from the scene and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services,” said a news release dedicated to reporting.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top management does not seem to be credible, our military suffer,” stated a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican in California.
Management problems in Centcoma have reached the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the deficits that have continually arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although he does not have the final evidence that Obama's management had ordered the falsification of accounts, he argues that analysts felt that the Centcoma's leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat on the part of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were far more optimistic than actual events” was reported.
For example, a Centcoma official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certain," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Central Command Intelligence Service had faltered intelligence documents to alleviate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republics formed an operational group when they learned that the analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence of the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progressed, more data will be collected from Thursday.
An additional, pending investigation by the Centcoma is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of a democratic party in the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Operations Group.
“Centrem has established an overly restrictive procedure for the production of exploration assessments concerning IHIL and the Iraqi security forces for every year in 2014 and 2015,” claims in a statement by the member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of a democratic party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schifa, “departed the release of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral integrity of the analysts and “does not sufficiently reflect differing views”.
But Schiff and the democracies claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to force the Entrepreneurs of Centcoma to force their conclusions to be “sacrifice or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday by the Daily Best portal.
Last August The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, who was opened after complaints by the analysts of Centcoma.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the investigation of the Chief Inspector was continuing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the United States-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (now claims to be more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence) has achieved its objectives.
But last year's statements make us wonder whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The crisis of intelligence on the Islamic State repeats disputes that took place more than ten years ago when the intelligence analyst Kentkom Gregory Hucker wrote a research article alleging that the administration of President George Walker Bush had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what would follow the invasion of 2003.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence over the Islamic State.
In the past year, according to officials, Huker's team concluded that, despite public announcements of the contrary, aircraft at the Islamic State oil refineries had not significantly damaged the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in September in the Times.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after witnessing in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be an overly optimistic assessment of war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Totel.
The U.S. won four consecutive times in the women's hockey on grass, thus approaching a decisive seizure with Britain
Cathy Bam shot three heads at a match that ended in victory over Japan with a 6-1 account, opened the Thursday account with the first two heads for a U.S. women's hockey team on grass, when the Americans won victory over the Indian team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27 years old, says she wouldn't be sure if she would ever do something like that.
"Hum, I won't bring it," she said.
I'm not really the kind of people who keep track of their nakedness.
That's what she knows: the U.S. 4-0 account in the Olympic Tour, and they compete for the first time in their group with Britain, which remains unconvinced after Japan's win-win with 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter of the final, and the outcome of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid a strong team of Dutch rivals, the leaders of another group, a little bit of the weather when the fourth-firm game starts.
Saturdays, however, show that the Americans here made noises of their unexpected series four years after they took their last place among the 12 teams in London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, taking a hockey stick on her grass when she was 3 (her senior twin sisters played this sport at Drexel) and joining the 16-year-old national assembly as her youngest player in history.
She missed the Olympiad 2008 when she did not pass the final selection tour.
Then came 2012 when things went wrong with her and her teammates.
The following year, Koig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the same productivity as we do now.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable arm shot at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised by the hardness and maintained the account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long drive with the ball down on the left side of the field, then walked into the middle and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans a two- to zero advantage.
Melissa González added the final head in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first to be won by Jackie Briggs, a U.S. military helicopter to pass one head at each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Through the Olympic Games invisibility - Sun on Battalians
Wherever you are, whatever time, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio have appeared to be constant and inevitable; they are a vicious combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's that burning torch that goes from the archer to the cane, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in turn in a cafe and not hear of Simon Biles, Katy Ledeki or the hostile between Michael Felix and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, for the first time participating in the Olympic Games, is a hen with eggs on herds, could well be among the famouss shown by the tradesmen who are being promoted by sponsors and life-supporting ads if he was a singer, a gymnast, or even a fekhwalt.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lakeforest, California, struggles for gold in Olympic competitions on beta.
The Olympic Fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Further away from the centre, in part in the shadows, are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic pistol, bow shooting, babminton, tekvondo.
Brass will always be with us for his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak hard to defend your personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the jockeys on the beta.
Although the jockeys have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at games in Sydney, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are generally associated with Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won the medals in the jockeys, and their athletes did not finish up until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male awards and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dunn Dunn from China and Rouzie McLennan from Canada will protect his London gold medals this year.
But the shoes have an outsider layer, especially because the ear is more easily associated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, but just a ground-based enthusiasm.
They do have the Commotic potential, which is the cartoon of unconquested jockeys — but also the simility of the hyptics and jockeys in the water, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el tramolín" which means "tamplin for jumps in water."
The candidates for the victory jump on a giant bat that takes up almost 30 feet into the air and must perform a series of acrobat tricks (backs, muscles and salto) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and flight time according to the official programme of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is forward.
The candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher, and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes finish, and sometimes back and forth, up and down the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start-up wall, but also, like, the TV camera, the other far away: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatically enough to make even the eye shine.
But I think it's kind of embarrassing when I look at the game.
They give him a break.
Battist direction is upward.
Movement forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems improbable, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort again.
And they don't have any competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy zeal for finny throughout the program, no leaps in length, only strange, spectacular disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the most intimate Olympic sport to the day.
Women's qualification competitions, and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon, on the hour of the day for Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also on the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final from 2:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. as part of the day program.
A quiet, beautiful moment is expected, and can easily be seen in a joint dump, at the height of the Olympic Summony.
And if growing consciousness can only be achieved by putting the male athletes in perspective and objectiveization, as according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by the American gay men, Dooley is only waiting for his new excited crowd of fans.
Generation Protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. Ally
Prominent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrates requiring political change in Ethiopia faced a strong opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protestors were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa ' s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly removed at the end of the past or earlier this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put them on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it would be even more difficult, ” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Africa Horn project in the international research team.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions - opposition in the territory of the State has been blocked by the fact that dissidents have actually been forced to remain silent.
Many of them were referred to, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people constantly suppress and leave no choice but to protest, the rebellion will be lifted,” said Seyum Teshame, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Many complaints, beginning with land use, culminating in the takeover of government by a coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government Party and its allies have completely pushed aside opposition and are now in control of 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use disturbances and re-arms.
A number of factors explain why bitter emotions, which have been boiling deep for several years, are now flashing.
The first would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
Over the past couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services are better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they were organized to protest.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oro and Amhar, two of the largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Ormo and Amhar are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhar, out of the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, has flourished in politics and business, operating Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
“We will act together at a single beginning,” said Mulata Gemech, leader Ormo.
Major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amhar and Ormos feel that in Ethiopia, the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population, is unjustly dominated by military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
A third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical hero, a man who might have anticipated a danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly cruel in identifying the initial signs of dissension and that he had used spies to obtain data and eliminate opposers.
“The present regime lacks sound meaning, ” said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalov, appeared nowhere and occupied Melesa.
Unlike Melesa, who was born from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam, southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that, as a result, there will be more bloodshed.
Last time, Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, as the analysts said, there seemed to be a choice that the Government was engaged in and then falsified.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in the last months, and this period of unrest took place relatively rapidly.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to the Ethiopian leaders for the far-reaching development of infrastructure, such as the new train for long-term and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this has not stopped the upsurge in internal frustration by the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondara, Amhar town, attacked the Tigri-owned enterprises, and anti-Tigro hatred in social networks is becoming comprehensive.
The analysts claim that the protestors place the United States and other West Allies at a disadvantage.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already volatile region.
"And it will be difficult on this long canvas to pass," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that YHIL was founded by Obama, "Sercasdam."
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict, covering his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when several times this week stated that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of a terrorist group by the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions regarding the ability of the Republican party ' s presidential candidate to address the American people in a sensuous manner.
It also placed its alternates, who were trying to protect him during the period of unrest, in a awkward situation, since they had to explain their comments that he probably did not mean.
Following this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had established ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just scooping.
This position was a direct contrast to the statement made just one day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican party presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal struck when Trump tried to reoriented his campaign to the economy against the downside of the rating.
Trump and Clinton spoke competitively about Michigan's economy this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back on this topic.
Again, when he came to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to increased taxes, and said that he saw her speak boring.
Trump has used sarcas as an excuse before.
At the end of July, when he came across general criticism, he almost showed the idea that the Russians should hack over Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm kidding."
Such an approach would allow Trump to go beyond what is permitted in political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think that it is his way to test some of the messages that are responding to his worshipers, to see how they act, and then to “explain” them in one direction or another, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analysed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he's saying, and he knows that they're too vague to treat them differently.
Instead of softening speech for a broad electorate, Trump has taken even more brighter tones in the last days, while its rating continues to fall.
The new rating of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump was giving up the Klingon with a high wire in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and went to Florida level.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and for not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump had been the target of considerable attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes had made his loyal allies uncomfortable, and they had to support him publicly, no matter how provocative his comments were.
Rudolph W. Juliani, former mayor of New York, one of the most well-known deputy Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given to CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when asked about the credibility of Trump's allegation that Obama and Clinton were founded by the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost an unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-representative threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he had withdrawn troops from Iraq.
The majority of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton occupied the post of Secretary of State, allowed IGIL to develop, since it had not been able to resolve the situation in the Middle East with a keen sense of urgency.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Tromp continued to attack the media for defusing his words and prejudice.
He was mocking the "funless" TV experts who were trying to untie him, and he said, "He's weak."
Some democracies ridiculed Trump's excuses as more than confirming that he's not fit for president.
Someday, the sloppy coffee comes back to Green Point.
The Vembian coffee was an embroidered, only hosted by a cash spot in Williamsberg, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was driven out of her apartment with a beeford Avenue.
Soup Cherie, who took the Web site in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a refreshing town.
The artist Molly Krabuple wrote in Twitter, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verbor is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it's being updated.
The rebirth of Vebre opened in November of last year at Green Point, less than a mile north of the original location.
In the new Verbe there's Wi-Fi taking credit cards, but there's some of the same staff and a kind of simple atmosphere.
Plus, coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisco Rodriguez, an old coffee worker who owns and managers in a new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there right up to the end.
When one of the clients offered to propose it in a new location, he said that he would be happy to see it.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left much behind.
The Web works with the same bike detector and buys the same caffeine model.
He's even installed from the old Web.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes bacon, eggs and cheese sandwiches, and has a caper or roasted bow top button.
There's a brown rice dish.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but now they're making fresh, fresh juices.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
"Many ex-clients have also cast out Williamsberg prices," he shared.
In a recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Olivier, who was 34 years old, had lived in Williamsberg before and had often visited the Web.
Even after she moved to Green Point, she still went there.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that I had imbedded in Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual food coffee, she ordered bought some tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been loyal to the Web since 2003.
He went ahead and ordered the same thing.
"Fifty minutes eight, every day, I came in at an hour, and for me, I prepared my bowl with butter and all the stuff," he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still doing his usual job, but he's ever changed something with the help of a bacon, an egg or cheese in a bowl with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the store having once taken an old place.
Moreover, Soup Cherie offered to produce special soap for Verba, using coffee from a caffeine produced in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The Polish Permanent Residents also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to find a place for him in the vortex to make his new neighbors feel desirable.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice sales spot plans to split up the bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the coffee can be added to the nearby building.
It's enough for many clients to include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whittt was a regular client and told him that he was dead when they closed.
When the coffee was opened in a new location, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"As long as I wanted to feel this scent," he admitted.
Depressive meal of depression in "Flee Tree."
In March 1933, shortly after taking office as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gurman, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of the Fifth Avenue, for example, the Fua Game and the Meridian turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest, with eggs painted in tomato sauce, potatoes and dessert pudding in blacks.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coo, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to feed."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in the history of food.
Koua's last book, "Riga Chinese", was devoted to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in the living room at the lower East Side through his meal in his book House 97 on the Street Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work, "Plan Stars", will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some way their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Sohp, a tiny short-breeder in the Faltayron district, which has been working since 1929, year of the Birges.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a plume cheese and a sandwich with olive slices, and Cou, 57, took an turkey, potatoes, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was a suitable starting point for discussion on the food in the Depression era.
"The pilots have had a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, a bob roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and the cheap products that enabled them to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Whoo's fumbled.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years leading up to depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
A group of women were prepared for farm men, and a freshly secured pie was fed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who were sending food to hungry Europeans during World War I that described how the country did so suddenly as a country of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Cow, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was true of a new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and bakers, became the basic foodstuffs; bakery was a “precious way to get together, ” said Zigelman, because the cooks could hide nonappetite ingredients under a thick sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying.
The meat, the former foundation of American food for many years, has become economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
Through research into a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a dish of that age: a baked bow made of peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table has not been successful," said Cow.
Sigelman added, "It was very strange."
The peanut butter isn't exactly suitable for the scorched bow.
This has been the case for many household recipes.
As never before, home workers — including Louise Stanley, Chief of the Federal Home Office, from 1923 to 1943 — were managing the country’s food habits.
Through the use of prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become budget contributors, to challenge and transform amber like protein spaghetti and carrot into delicious dishes.
The "Plan table" is a piece of curious historical facts.
Especially poplar accounts of the Government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's position in the spirit of “fowl pies”.
He was fed like a thin millionaire who became a widowed farmer in the state of Iowa.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with brown sauce," said Coe.
He ate practically in a gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantasticly dispossessed of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not suggested that he give an example to his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House “using not only the most debased food in Washington, but sometimes the most repulsively prepared”.
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten once the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple tell us that when writing a book, they better understand the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she was unable to throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of neglecting food," said Ko.
Siegelman says, "She's been poisoning people."
There was one unpleasant case of prophylls.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were emptied, Coo and I got the dessert that we had prepared at home: the draft of the blacks, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a black muse," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widely distributed reception to give modest recipes a brocade name.
There were no broken plums, only blacks, a little flour, sugar, water, and coral.
Everyone with an reluctantness was loaded with a spoon in a viscosity, brown, sticky substance.
Surprised, it was good.
Coho twice asked for some additions.
With the voice of a confident budget manufacturer, he said to his wife: "No one would be prevented from doing so."
Arrest of figures on the mass fight on the Khovan cemetery extended until 14 November
The Presnan court left until 14 November under arrest the figures in the case of the mass fight in the Khovan cemetery, granting the request of the investigation.
There are 14 accused persons.
Recall that, on 14 May, a massive fight took place in the Khovan cemetery of several hundred residents from Central Asia and the Northern Caucasus using weapons killing three people.
The former leader of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the community organization, Alexander Bocarnis, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second pension indexing in 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Holder, reported on this during his visit to the Brensk region.
We have set specific parameters on how to raise our pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists now take half a century, and we'll finish this work within the next two to three weeks, quote the Lobby Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed six-year pension scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexe Kudrini, every year, a vice-premier reported that the topic was not addressed in the cable.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a full pension indexing position in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigranyan were at the final competition to shoot a small-scale rifle.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigarian were in final competition to shoot from a low-calibre rifle on the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to the TSS, Sergey Kamensky has recruited 629 points and has taken the first place, a new Olympic record of qualifications.
Kirill Grigranyan became second, 628.9 years old.
Eight of the best athletes passed into the finale.
Kamensky is the world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Officer Fethullah Gulen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempt at a coup d'état”, quotes the French newspaper Le Munde, Gulen.
The Turkish opposition officer also stated that “if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey”.
However, Güllen denied involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization had never favored political power.
The Istanbul Court of Justice previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fathaullah Gulen.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey during the night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will recover the costs of legal services during a patent dispute for hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Science Inc has the right to obtain reimbursement for the costs of legal services that it has incurred in connection with the issue of a patent for medicines from hepatitis C, with Merck & Co Inc, decided by a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was released from the payment of $200 million in damages for the violation of the two patents of Merck relating to the medicines of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the United States judge had discovered a number of violations by Merck, including lies under oath and other non-ethnic acts.
On Thursday, a judge at the U.S. Federal District Court, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred during the lawsuit.
Merck's company is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for new generations of hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which was the basis of the sofozobastire, an active drug ingredient of Gilead.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have intercepted the complete control of Manbidge from the Islamic State
Armed forces established with the support of the United States took full control of the northern town of Manbidge near the Turkish border, after the last militants in the city of the Islamic State left, informed the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who fled to the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, reported to the Reuters agency, Stefan Darwish, from the Allied with the Mobage Military Council DD.
"The city is under our control, but we are doing cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released his 2015 tax declarations on Friday, showing that the president of the democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Klintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly from the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received some $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuser for her book on her employment in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax declarations over 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard of financial transparency”, said in the statement to the pre-election headquarters adviser of Clinton Jennifer Palmier.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make public his tax declarations.
This is a common case for candidates for U.S. Presidents to publish their tax declarations, although they do not require the law to do so.
A New York businessman, Trump, and his lawyers called the State Tax Service verification as a reason for their refusal to publish their tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote in Twitter, an adviser to the pre-election headquarters of Clinton Jan Sams, referring to a declaration by a Democratic Party candidate.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the checks were completed.
The Trump Critics, including the presidential candidate for the Republican party in 2012, Mittt Romney and other Recubemen, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Russia.
Clinton took care of the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on prominent republicans, who persuaded Trump to publish the tax report.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during her talk about the Michigan economy.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: to make public her tax declarations,” she said to the meeting.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the business writer of the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Fridays who felt that possibly cases would still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute at the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omama, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate was based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under IRS checks and that Trump was afraid not of the tax agency but of the voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters had issued tax declarations up to 2007.
The Klingtons currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index food stock, and the Klintons announced dividends and capital returns of $109,000.

Rifle powder and fireworks will enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The Tanzanian environment fighters have used a non - traditional way of preventing elephants from entering human settlements by throwing condoms filled with powdered chili.
The method was effective, and the organization of Hyoneguide Foundation, which came into the head a few years ago, along with the American Committee on Nature Conservation, took over its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step, way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used copies to protect themselves.
There will be a Day of Elephants on Friday, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"As long as we have developed a set of tools... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they can keep elephants from falling on to their fields without causing harm to elephants," said Honeyguede Damian Bell, Executive Director.
The first two steps are to set fire to a torch in front of an elephant who is breaking the border and to signal by an horn.
If he's not allowed to go, they're throwing away the so-called "bar of chili".
The chili powder mixed with soil is placed with the cotton in a condom and the end is turned over, and only the pistil is left outside.
When inflammation, the condom spits out with groach, spraying a small dust of water into the air.
One arc is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air, making a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country following a coup d ' état in July of this year.
Such data were provided by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mewlut Chavushoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we called 208 personnel diplomats to continue working at the centre.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons or explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that a coup d'état was attempted in Turkey in July.
The authorities formally stated that the coup d ' état had failed and that over six thousand people had been detained, including high-level and medium-sized military personnel.
As a result of the coup d ' état, Turkey reported that 290 people had died, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Jewish filmmaker sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code from the Arab “request” channel, told the RT News
A French director of Jewish origin sent a scandal to the media, finding that Kempinski Bristol's hotel in Berlin did not appear on Israel's phone list, and the officers referred to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lantzman, author of a documentary about the “Shea Holocaust” film, expressed his frustration with the hotel of Kampinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at Lanceman Hotel, an attempt was made to find Israel on the telephone list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of a new Germany, Israel was disfellowshipped and eradicated?
I wrote Lanceman.
In exchange for Kempinski Bristol, it provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration's stamina.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, was "sucking him up."
The hotel clerk said that this was a “thinkable decision by the management of the Kampinski hotel network.”
The reason behind this step was further anger from the director.
“The majority of our guests were Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed, ” said Lantzmann, who was serving the hotel.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadass-Handelsman, described the incident as “a fearful disgrace”, reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and this hotel network is even more disgraced.
You don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions, ” said the official.
The event caused a small impact on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kampinski Hotel simply “assisted on” the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"To be ashamed," said another post stating that a hotel located on the famous street of Quurstendam was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened any charges by calling them "unsupervised" and "extreme" in front of Lantzman, reports the newspaper De Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel on the quick-recruit list”, quotes the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protesting Brazilians
The students met with the police in São Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when they came together to protest governmental reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to inflame students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals made by the Governor of the State of São Paulo Géraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing on the walls of the graphite against the temporary Acting President Michael Thamer.
This latest protest occurred just a few days after the protestors went out to the streets to support the retreated President Dilam Rusef when the Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports the RT Business portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade flows between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador Levan Jagarian of Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there had been an increase in interest on the part of Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies were renewing their ties with Iran, and new firms were ready to market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, ” said Jagarian.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarjan also predicts that this year Russia will be visited by a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic representation in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
Moreover, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of visitors to Russia.
It can be said with certainty that last year’s record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten, ” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to ensnare gays in the defence and industrial complex.
The reasons for dismissal were “systematic failure” of the genetic director of the Almaz-Anta, “abuse of work” and “loss of trust”.
The NGO leader has been appointed Gennady Benderski for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Nekorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media slaughter.
What is the explanation for such silence in the face of a massive rearmament of the army?
It is likely that the leaders of the Russian Federation do not wish to disseminate any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that there are many problems in the defence and industrial complex (PKC) and that the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
Departure of Nekorod is certainly an important development in terms of industry.
The Almas NGO is the main enterprise of the conron, which specializes in the production of air defence complexes (MANS) of sea and ground-based buildings.
At present, Almas is working on the development of the Politment-Reid and Morfey Rédé Rémbé Rété, which are scheduled to be installed on new roots, frigates, esmistans and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Dimitry Cornev is of the opinion that the dismissal of Nekorodov is due to the disruption of the project timeline.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of "Morfea" began as early as 2007 and was expected to begin in 2013.
Police Reeds should become the main system of PSBs on the latest VMF ships.
According to the information I get, in a few years of testing, no real success has been achieved.
True, as far as I can tell, there's no clear fault in Almasa, says Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in operationalization may also occur with the C-500 ARC.
The pilot work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to be deployed during 2016.
In the Minoborones, it is believed that “the work will be planned and it will be completed within a specified time frame”, although in 2014 the department recognized that there was a problem with the development of C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess Nekorodov's professional qualities, led by Almass, since 2011.
Cornev noted that the delays in project time could be both the excuse and the cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in PLOs and business management plans.
The industry received long - term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money is known to love silence.
Generally, the Directors of Defence Companies leave posts at their own request, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resuscitated.
This leads to the idea that Almaz's leader was probably a built-in figure and was opposed to the top-down "spoils."
It appears that the State will no longer tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the facilities of the Minoborone and fail to perform the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the leaders of the RF seek to punish the missing officials (the "Zvesda" shipyards).
The President has personally placed great emphasis on sectoral issues.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrialization Commission and holds periodic meetings on disarmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of OCC managers in an effort to have at hand the loyal composition of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is a far-reaching policy, but there are no other instruments in the PLOs.
The prevailing situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the armed forces into line as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of the management in the PAC, the FF leadership is taking successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The strength of the army has acquired a new quality, with Sergey Shoig, Minister of Defence.
The president seemed to take over a famous saying, "Do you want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s resulted in the Helsinki Pact, which fixed the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
In all of the shortcomings of the biopical system, it worked quite effectively.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof.
The “conquests” of the Cold War were eventually strengthened by international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world, ” there may be no calm corner left.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of equal partnership.
Under such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and reach new levels of global policy.
Scotch Kallum Skinner's running through the final straight line, which makes British gold take over.
Scotch Callum Skinner was running for triumph in a male command stop at a Velodrome in Rio last night, resulting in commanding three British forces defending their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the stronger friend of his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoe had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by passing through the final straight line to win the battle of the provincial team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to win four years ago when Hoy claimed to be the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had done the record of being modestly six on the Martian World Cup on track in London, even though Hoe had finished his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did it just when the Findes came out.
Hoja's departure also created the void that Kian Emmai and Matt Krempton attempted to fill.
Skinner was a British trainer who saw potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindez, Kenny — champions from Hoi four years ago — and Skinner set up an Olympic record of qualifications, but the standard was dominated by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for the gold.
Hendez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindez went on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep his pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner's glance, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the playtel.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flat comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make my name.
We've set up an Olympic record in the finale and won the champions of the world.
That was unbelievable.
There's no better way to win.
Following the triumph in London in 2012, Hindez, accompanied by Kenny and Hoi, confessed his deliberate fall on the tracks after a failed start.
He later gave up his comment and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the rostrum."
We've all met together as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so much race with the world's name that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 names of the race both in Beijing and in London.
If it's a barometer of progress over the past five months, then there are five more successful days waiting.
With the shape shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeated Hoa's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow us to see how Kenny — who is 12 years younger than Hoja, who was also born on 23 March (it seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bunnyer) — brings his account to six gold medals and one silver coin.
That would also be like Hoa's.
The next time, Kenny's going to compete in a snooze that starts today and opens up for three days.
A 28-year-old boy from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to defeat your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win each other, honestly.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get the knighty."
It was the only day you played medals, but there were some good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Whiggins, Ed Clencey, Stephen Burke and Owen Doll are the fastest four-kilometre team chased after four.
They kept it at 3:51.943.
The world record for gold gain in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finish (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Viggins will certainly be the focus.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, on the eve of a qualification assignment, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women ' s event, which is resumed and ending tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanne Rouselle Schend, Eleanor Barker and Katy Archibald of Milngawi improved world record, showing time 4:13,260.
The United Kingdom Command came to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the Olympic Games during the average period and earn a bunch of medals.
After truly exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations had weakened in the progressive preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second level, not the last, leaving the position of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April because of accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of large figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on a venodrome, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain in reaching its peak at the right time may be just another time.
Future of the Portland steel plant threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the owner of the plant, is about to terminate the supply contract: all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to sell subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A 20-year fixed grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, may be in a risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel plant consumes about 10 per cent of the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the steel plant in Point Henry, causing the power plant to shut down in Engles last year.
Alcoa, the Portland steel plant, loses money and risks closing.
These actions have led to thinking about the future of a plant that has been continuing for several years, initially because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the factory ' s products.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latreb-Walley, indicated that it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The control share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Almina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp belong to a smaller share.
“The AGL company expects the portland facility to continue to operate, i.e., that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not cease,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called “heeded contracts” that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of avoidance, so they will actually end in 2017.
“AGL is still waiting for these contracts to bring its share of income in the financial year 2017,” said the electricity company.
Whatever the potential impact on the profits of AGL since the financial year 2018 is now limited to projections of the strong future market for wholesale electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the volume of treaties by $187 million in terms of “remaining avoidance”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage a steel plant or to supply electricity to a steel plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Referring to analysts earlier this week, AGL Stephen Michaelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these factories leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electronics].
It will be bad for us as a manufacturer, ’ he said.
Not only the star of the real-sho Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of Kardashian-Dengner's mother-Manger Chris, appeared on the hive cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder's brand, who has been defiling a few weeks of fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his account at the Instalgram on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried, ” wrote Kendall.
The news of the cover was accompanied by strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared by the real video, in which the entire family of Kardashian-Dengner (deboshires of Rob and Kathlin, also associated with the universal uncle of show-business, the producer of the Kardashian family, Rayan Sicrest), had forgotten the arrival of sisters on the cover, and at the end of the class turn, they had planned the Christmas Eve party.
It's a standard reference line for almost all episodes of children's television shows, dedicated birthday days (Sicris says, "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from eight o'clock's programme), but Chris needed to get this fame to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode of September's Vogue, we certainly entered a new era of Kardashian show.
Let Kendalle Kim be on the cover of Vogue earlier (it appeared to her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but September’s cover of the magazine is an achievement.
September is the most sold issue of Vogue for the year.
It is more like a gift book than a fashion magazine that attracts a huge number of advertising agents (as calculated by the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year ' s 832-country edition contained advertising).
The news about who would fall on his cover is so hopeful that during the past two years, photographs of the magazine have merged to the official annots.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more “significant” than “the models that are famous” on the cover.
The Oscar Prize winner and the person of Brando Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage fell.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as "the emerging model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's a good company.
These famouss are not relatives of known people, stars of reality or modern children who know how to make a good video at Snapachat (though Jenner falls into all of these categories).
They are truly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Baeons on last year's cover, this year was one of the best in a career with regard to Lemonade's album.
Of course, we're not all happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her previous television reality star, had always had to remain fragile.
In June, one of the first models of Vittoria's Secret Stephanie Seimur opened up Jenner and her colleague Jiji Hadid, calling them "the matter of time."
These moods were again stirred after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to dwell on discontent.
Kendal Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue.
It is a super model in all its meanings.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sells her pictures to you in her own appendages, which are available on the payroll.
She's selling her own photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.
And in free time, perhaps still to see her sister Cortney and her children, she's involved in the reality of television.
Public legal centres refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected persons are denied services at public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding by already reaching the limits of opportunities.
In Queensland, three out of five persons — mostly elderly, immigrants, defenseless workers, victims of violence, people without access to unfair property deprivation, have already been denied in an effort to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services that are already working away from opportunities are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Legal Centres, James Farrell, said that, according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people per year have been denied.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision is not cancelled, the situation will only deteriorate.
“ Queensland's public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people are denied essential services,” he said.
People who are victims of violent relations, those who have failed to manage and dispossess, families who are going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers, all of them have legal problems, and this account shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will fund 30 per cent since June 2017 and therefore thousands of less protected Queensland residents will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland George Brandis to withdraw these funding reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when faced with legal problems.
Last year the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the country's average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Government of Palashuk to engage in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court after the staff member was allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court: the headquarters allegedly did not take anything after the report that his operative director in North Carolina threatened a gun to the staff member while they were driving to the Jeep in February.
The case was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in the State Court in Charlotte Wintor Bordini, a former software instructor at the state electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he was waiting for several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that “this will not happen”.
Director Earl Phillip, "rejecting the gun, putting his right index finger on the hen and handing the duel to Vincent's knee cup," says Bordiny in his complaint.
Having felt at the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had been involved in similar incidents with Philly, had been admitted.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to do harm," said Bordini in a complaint.
A search took place just two days after the Republican party presidential candidate named Furor told North Carolina that “people of the Second Amendment” — understood as the arms owners and their lovers — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to choose judges.
Trump's pre-election headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of the context and that he did not speak in favour of violence.
In its complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the pre-election headquarters for negligence and from Philly for the threat of physical violence, insults and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks slowed down, responding to the request for comment.
Attempts to speak with Philip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to calls from his consulting firm, innovative consulting services, no one called quickly.
Donald Trump, President of the Republican Party, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Danube J. Troump For Press Inc., 16-CS-1400, High Court of Mecklenburg (Sharlott).
Britain must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Hithrou
It will also bring revival and prosperity, not only in our villages here and in London as a whole, but also throughout the country.
I think that was exactly the great advantage of Hithrou, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again, making it possible for local residents and firms near Hithrow.
For our human settlements here, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Hithrow is too ambitious.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove wrong about Hithrou.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hithrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Hithrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Hithrou that introduced programme 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 to T5 selected by the best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2 built in the middle of two of the world's two airstrips.
They are now ready to provide the third airstrip, which has been confirmed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Olympic Games were a great success for Britain in 2012, and I am sure that the expansion of Hithrou will be as well.
The time has come for us to direct the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Hithrou, providing for our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain will be able to take pride in.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hithrou and former Trade Attasche Treasury
Adlock Plus, Facebook plays buttons on advertising blocking
For companies that make money on the Internet commercials, trying to cut down advertising software is a game of cat-kids, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its website desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog listing that users could update their filters into the program to block advertisements on the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook, Facebook announced that the site's desktop version would change the back of its ads to make it more difficult for advertising brokers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he could pass through the new code.
In his blog publication, the representative of Adlock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the public-source blockers community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of the advertising locks” and that Facebook might present its own decision as soon as possible.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network was fighting is a clear sign of how much of the problem has been the market blockers for industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's study of pagesfair and Adobe; almost four times the number who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who walk on Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook revenue from advertising.
However, the company hunts for blockers of ads on a desktop version, because mobile blockers are not good in their Facebook mobile applications for the social network and the Intagram, according to the representative.
But advertising in the tablebook, it's a fairly profitable article to make Facebook view this step as a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday Facebook, it announced that it was going to update its “religatory preferences” tool to give people more control over how they were being advertised.
On Thursday Facebook, it was stated that the new Adblock filters were a cause for concern, as they would also block some non-reclamation content on the website.
"It won't be a good experience for people, and we're going to solve this problem," said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertisement blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools such as advertisements to hand over control to people.
A woman moved to a Swiss highway at the scene of her apparent suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles to a highway in the morning of Thursday morning in an obvious attempt to commit suicide.
The incident took place at A1 near Morge in the canton W, immediately after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay on the road in the darkness of “extreme despair” and was hit by a number of vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
A number of vehicles, including a truck, were hit by a Swiss woman who was 49 years of age in an attempt to kill herself.
She died in place.
Several of the drivers who had been taken away had already been interviewed, but some had not yet been identified, reported to the police, who called on them and anyone who had witnessed the incident to respond.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated, a “liquid” step in such a situation, and counsel Jile Hofstter Le Tribune de Geneva stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor must identify," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be declared responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a person in the dark on the highway, the sentence was passed that motorists could not expect an accident with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year an officer was acquitted of death by carelessness after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Paiern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim of dust lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a police woman — who responded to an emergency challenge — was run by a vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a human on the road was “exclusive and unpredictable”, said the judge.
Anyone who has information of the incident on Thursday at Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to NASA’s new climate model.
Researchers at the Space Research Institute of Slovene, Goddard, developed a model for research on the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by climateists.
The model was designed to determine whether there could be conditions similar to that of the Earth in Venus, with its hot waterless surface and the atmosphere that had been moved by carbon dioxide.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus’s slow speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus may have had a broken atmosphere like the Earth, and still turns slowly.
The model also considered the topography of the morning of Venus.
On the planet, there were probably more dry regions than on Earth, but it once had enough water and sufficient geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thick.
"According to the GIS model, Venus's slow return is giving her day-to-day side of the sun almost two months at a time," explained a press scientist from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the planet's surface and produces rain that creates thick clouds that act as an umbrella protecting the planet's surface from a substantial portion of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly colder than today's on Earth.
The model shows Venus’s history, similar to that previously suggested by scientists in the field of planets.
Even though Venus may have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated, and her water vapors were consumed by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen was gone, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect — Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in the Geophysic Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the post of coach for the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the post of Coach and Vice-President of the hockey activity, Colorado Avalanche, on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Commander of the Colorado team, Joe Sackik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as the chief coach and vice president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I've been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth she needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and Vice-President of the hockey exercise must be perfectly consistent with the organization's vision.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award winner as the best league trainer during her first season with Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 points and the victory in Central Divide, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the Pythagos and played the Pythago in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and five points were separated from the Wild team in the fight for a second privileged fit to attend the Western Conference.
The gate of the Hall of Fame, Roy, won four Stanley Cubes — two with Mantreal Kandiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend the strike
Work strikes on oil salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and all the parties to the discussion are coming to a new round of negotiations and the lead parties have been informed.
Probations against the Wood Group oil service company were frequently organized on platforms in the North Sea under Royal Duch Shell.
"Wood Group and Union Alliances and RMTs can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process for the resolution of ongoing disputes," is stated in a joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of the next week, to look at the problems with fresh vision.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was against potential cuts up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced rates for contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to the negative market tensions.
The lower rates by the company resulted from a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract workers working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give it the space necessary to overcome the market drop.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and has announced plans to end oil-producing activities in countries up to 10 as it rationalizes its activities due to its development with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low price of oilless: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by Great Britain.
Scottish member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that took place in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes, throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected to cost 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
The caper measures the speed of the stars in the Pleedia copy
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalogue of stars ' speeds in Pledja.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars are rotating at different speeds, as well as how rotational periods relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” explained a press release to Louise Ribal, a researcher at the Centre for infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
It is located in 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many stars in the fossil are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They spin as fast as they will ever be.
At their peak speed, these adult stars cast out large quantities of star wind.
Through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed starts to slow down.
He measures the speed of each star’s rotation by tracking the time between the known star stains, such as the sun’s stains.
The newer speed catalog suggests that more massive stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
The fishing industry compares stars to dancers: larger pyruites make pyruites slower than smaller ones.
We see that those who rotate slowly, usually more massive, while those who go faster usually refer to very light stars, ” said the Market.
Since Pleedja's accumulation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of stars with the speed of rotation.
“The late accumulation of Pleiades provides a starting point for the theoretical patterns of the stars, both young and old, ” said Richall.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow their speed and hang their 'Tantinal shoes' on the nail, so to speak.
The fishing industry and its colleagues presented their latest analysis of Pledja speed in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation into the activities of a group of detainees in the Crimea of Ukrainian Diversants is carried out by two agencies, which writes “Commersant”.
The FSB collects evidence of detainees ' involvement in the preparations for the Diversium in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Eugenius Panov testified to cooperation with the investigation.
He said that, as a diversification facility, he considered the chemoprochement of the Titan in Armyansk, the oilbasze in Fedosia, the Kerchen ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields.
The law enforcement authorities believe that it is not possible to detain all the factors involved in the diversion.
This was particularly the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev City of Simferopolie, noting the publication.
Stanislav Cherchezov became the main trainer of Russian football.
At the meeting of the Executive Officer of the Russian soccer Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchezov as the chief trainer of the Russian collecting football.
The contract will be awarded for two years, until the conclusion of the CMM-2018.
On August 11, the RFS appointed Stanisław Cherchezov as the chief trainer of the Russian soccer team.
This is a well-known football player who used to play in Moscow's Spartaca positions at the gate, as well as a trainer with great experience, who was a mentor of Russian teams like Spartacus, Zhenczyk, Trek, Amcar, Dinamo, as well as the Warsaw Lega, who was a winner of the country's national priority and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchev will be signed as soon as possible and will be for two years.
It is therefore the duty of him to prepare for the World Cup of 2018.
It is known that his training headquarters will include Miroslav Romachenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
It is reported that the salary of the entire training headquarters will be Euro2.6 billion per year.
According to media reports, the FSF authorities set Stanislav Cherchezov’s goal to bring the Russian prefabricated group to a semi-quinal and to win the medal.
As the coach himself said, as a matter of priority, he considers creating a competitive environment on the team and is going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchezov, he is glad that the choice has been put on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchez's prefabricated Russia will be held on August 31, in Antal, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall, earlier, Leonid Slouctski was the head trainer of the Russian football team, who combined him with the training at the CSAC Club.
He stated that he had left the post after the Russian national team had delivered an announcement to Europe 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad outcome of the proselytised exercise.
In its occupation between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered a great deal during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million had made tremendous progress, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government has placed great emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries see free primary and secondary education as their own, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require school fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to charge fees for “buying costs”.
In Namibia, however, education in primary schools is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has become free of charge since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
The Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, has fallen by 15 points since 1993.
Then, 23 years ago, the figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has far ahead of the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Anti-Corruption Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain high rates of growth.
At the same time, the debt to GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has problems and problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional methods of assessment, remain high, almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, in Namibia the high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the more middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties that are common to weak economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the deserts, there are isolated nomadic hunter tribes in the country who must be integrated into modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
The integration of people, who were on the world economy a quarter of a century ago, is difficult for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, and the country was dealing with its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is noteworthy that rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that separates the country from the poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose neighbors, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate, to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and to share with students.
Moreover, the Namibian Government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily be a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia ' s natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum return from the sale of the country ' s resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that they do so.
Sufficientness is crucial to this process, and strong Government support for freedom of speech is so important.
According to Haega Heingob, the media often say something they don't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, says the President.
Not all key resources in Namibia are exhausted.
Some - such as fisheries - were renewable and the Government was making every effort to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even countries that begin with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment — can embark on common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and appreciation.
Many have heard of Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4000 B.C.E.).
Perhaps this was the most dramatic archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of golden artifacts were found, with a total weight of more than 3,000 pounds [6 kg].
Only one burial known as “Mililla No. 43” was recovered from 990 gold objects, weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient world could soon turn to an unscathed bush found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again, in Bulgaria, there is a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Yunacíté is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunaci, in the region of Pazardik.
Bosina is a golden strip turned into a ring.
Javor Bojadiv, a digger in Tel Yuncicite, dated the site 4,600 before our Common Era and claimed that she was older than Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasure of Varna, remind us, dates from about the same period, 4,600 to 4,200 years before our Common Era.
There are no current technologies that allow accurate date of metal.
How, then, can we be sure of how much more ancient gold is?
Apparently, Professor Bojajiev knows more than Reuters said, "I'm pretty sure the gold of the Union is older than the gold of Varna."
It's an important discovery: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Bojajiev reported that scientists would soon analyze the composition of the metal and re-examine and study the archaeological layer where gold artifact was found.
It'll help date the tarpaulin with as precise as possible.
The location of the finds also explains much.
It's a pretty famous village, even if you've never heard of it.
At present, Tel Yunacite is considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
The Tel was founded by descendants of people migrating to Europe from Anatolia, modern - day Turkey, in the seventh millennium B.C.E.
During the following centuries, metal processing developed in the region, from the development of first metal skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
The national history for this archaeological community is specifically known as the Balkans-Carpathian metallurgy province.
By the fifth century B.C.E., cities of urban type began to develop around metal processing centres.
Now they are called the oldest cities of Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacite may have been the oldest since the artifacts of 4900 years before our Common Era were found here.
I'd call Tel Yunci a prototype of today's city, even though this is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"It's a place older than Shumer for a thousand years," says Bojadiv, in view of the widely accepted view that urban culture originated in the south of Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were created in the familiar sense of the word.
The proceedings of the Tel Yunacite have been under way since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have dug nearly 12 hectares, about one third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the wall, which was once three metres high, were found.
There is little that has been maintained from homes and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dams, business centre and residential areas.
The Tel Yunacite is often referred to as “Stay City ”: dozens of clay birds have been found here.
All the birds were depicted in a state of peace, and this led to the assumption that they were not ornamental objects but were the object of local cult.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 years before our Common Era -- possibly the Indo-European tribes that came from the north-east.
There were no towns, but there were horses and guns.
Three-metre anchor walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have discovered clear signs of a brutal battle, and old people, women and children have been found inside homes with wounds caused by the fighting squads.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing familiar concepts about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking about the first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans, rather than separate cultures.
A powerful incentive to find this civilization was the golden Varna found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury must have been preceded by something -- something like a tiny gold bush that was set up in Tel Juncite.
Porsche artificially aged 911 Targa
Officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out by manual specialists of the unit dealing with serials.
Retro-luk is, for example, a special color in the Etna Blue body, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B - even the logo of the model.
In addition, it received a brand white schedule along the sides and special 20-douged RS Spyder disks, as well as some details of the body design that was painted in the "white-gold metal".
In the interior of the retro-trete, there is a very smaller number: it is, in large terms, a gray-separate structure, new drawings with extended electrical regulation and separate black anonymously bound thresholds with a unit logic.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will be given a Czech gift for the car and a rich, separate album with photographs of the production process.
The power installation of Porsche Exclusive touch did not come into existence: retro-creature by characteristics is quite the same as serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylindride motor with a turbondal volume of 3.0 litres, developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Designer will be released in limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular gymnasium is reported.
Facebook and Adverts fired the “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent the masking of advertisements on social pages has prompted decision makers to block ads for action.
Adja Plus released an objection, but Facebook is about to make it useless.
So Adja Plus announced his new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a little while.
The social media noted that in an effort to deceive new technologies of unblocked advertising, the decision of ACP Plus, together with commercial advertisements, has blocked many regular positions from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted the policy of AdAR Plus and promised to resolve the problem soon.
As a source for the TechCrunch social network developers, the code for ACP Plus is useless on the Facebook dextone site will be ready for the next hour.
Thus, socialists and blockmen have unleashed a sort of “arm of arms race” by trying to play each other, but the affected party became users who missed interesting notes from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of advertising blocking have recently given rise to heated disputes.
In Murmansk, the governor will be tried . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His case has already been concluded with an investigation by the Russian Federation Investigation Committee on the Murman region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual violence.
The investigation found that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Pavel Street area in Murmansk had committed acts of a sexual nature, using violence against a 20-year-old girl; the criminal case against the approved indictment was referred to the merits.
The provision provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring his cossbyen Fengang 370 and Rich New -- Web site www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengang 370 is a representative of China's most popular vehicle class, combining the dignity of a minivan and a Kroissover.
Another declared Russian Prime -- Rich New.
Many western firms of the Moscow International Motor Vehicle have chosen to ignore this year, so the void of Crocus Expo exhibitions will fill Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be taken by the Dongfeng Motore Corporation, which has large species on the Russian market and intends in the near future to offer our auto-lovers some interesting news.
One of these will be the Doongfeng Fengang 370 traded in China this spring at a price of 55,900 Yuan (some less than 550,000 roubles at the current rate).
The Russian Federation is unlikely to see such a price shining, and the question of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach 11th place on the list of the most widely sold minivans, although, owing to the large road light (175 mm) and the protective plastics on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be added to the Krossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-line platform of the Fengang 360 model, in the 370s the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design of the salinity, and the equipment is richer.
Salon was painted with wooden bars, but the large vertical TV display on the central console showed up only in the early copies of the puzzle, and the music machine was sold.
Five of the seven landing places are easily formed, forming a uniform loading area of 1650 mm long, with a maximum capacity of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine is only 1 - 1.5-litre petrol "atmosphere" with 115 l.s. together with a 5-tier mechanical gearbox.
The dynamic quality of the machine is modestly reduced by the manufacturer, but the owner of the appetite is promised a savings budget of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picpe Rich New is well-known to the Russians of Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a little bit of Chinese stylist design.
Despite the increasingly outdated design, this model still enjoys stable demand from Chinese consumers as a reliable and unwelcome horse.
At the rising price of Rich New, I'm sure I'm interested in the Russians, because modern Japanese pictors have become infinitely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines of choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.s) or turbine 2.5 l (16 l.s.).
The gearbox is only a mechanics, drive on the rear wheel, but there are modifications and with a rigid front connected.
He'll be at Dongfeng's stand and his new flag-ship A9, his Russian Prime Office, the Chinese firm's anonymous office back in June.
There's an increasing number of minivano-like puzzles in the Chinese market, some of the latest news -- Crow V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Dongfeng liner of Russia consists of two models: S30 sedium and H30 rats.
In seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese firm carried 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail to the Web site following the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the distribution of property tax notices.
All Russian motorists are used to a year-long pattern: in summer and autumn they receive a transportation tax receipt for the previous year.
This year, however, many do not wait.
The point is that the tax inspection has changed the way citizens are notified without any noise.
Those registered in the “Last Taxer's Office” on the official website of the local.ru agencies will be notified electronically.
The inspection automatically identified such Russians as online users and ruled them out of standard, paper mail.
The news is for all of the owners of vehicles and of the real estate.
All others will continue to receive customary letters.
On the other hand, it is possible to go back to the old scheme with an account account on the website.
To that end, they will have to visit the Tax Service during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "private office" immediately after writing, while the letter will take several days and may even be lost.
In addition, the number of Internet service users transferred to 18 million people, making it possible for the agency to have a serious savings on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in the “private office” for a single service and have long forgotten it.
They do not wait to receive notices by mail, and without knowing it, they will fall into the category of non-paymenters with all the consequences.
There are three ways of access to the “Liety Office of the Tax Payer”: through the recording of the hossulgi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or entry of the logic and password specified in the record card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any tax inspection office (in any case, place of registration).
We recall that the transportation tax should be paid up to 1 December in the current year.
The notices began in July.
Tunning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve very high returns, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not make G-Power ' s masters think about changing Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for his passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is strange to her masters.
In fact, why not improve G 63 - 571-strong balloon with tank aerodynamics and run to hundreds for 5.4 s?
The master's scooping up the crazy "helicopter" band has taken advantage of the power that opens up a 5.5-litre blow-up eight.
And then the wave pattern has improved to a hundred by an indiscretion of 0.1 s, and now it's able to fly for 5.3 s.
However, the acceleration from average speeds is likely to be better.
The speed ceiling is: if the standard G 63 is less than 210 km/h, then the tuner with an deactivated electronic shrubber can survive 250 km/h.
The vehicle is practically separate from its factory source, with the exception of other wheeled discs, the 23-D herriciane RR in size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maibach Lux Unit has nominated a striking conceptual pile of 6 m long, which will be represented in the Pebble Beach Elegance Convention.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with Green Subbrand BMW i and will move its electrical models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, a minimum of four green news is expected.
