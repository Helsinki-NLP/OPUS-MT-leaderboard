Republic Strategy for Resistance to the Re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy of combating falsification in elections.
However, at Brennan Center, the latest myth is considered, claiming that cases of falsification in United States elections are more rare than deaths from lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electronic falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: These new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the United States democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state Governments have adopted legislation since 2009 which complicates the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon was new in the aftermath of the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed limiting voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the elector to present a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early balloting, eliminate the right to register the elector on the day of the declaration and deny the right to vote to citizens of justice.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to produce a photo-ID.
Indiana became the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities have hastened to extend this practice to other states as well.
During the past two years, they have initiated draft laws that require voters to produce photo cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people, who have reached the age of voting, have no identity documents with the photo issued by their government authority in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card is often more than $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identity card.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for candidates from democracies are not allowed in several states to use the identity card issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states permit members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the permits issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no staff required proof of United States citizenship to vote.
For the first time, this was required in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are obviously intended to limit the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
Moreover, republican legislators had initiated laws in 2011 to eliminate voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction did not go unnoticed.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early balloting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33 per cent of the early voters were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the state ' s voters.
The same thing happened to Latin Americans.
Out of only 11 per cent of voters, they were 24 per cent of the citizens who voted ahead.
Unlike the whites, who had created 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters had already voted ahead.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been promulgated by democratic governors.
The most controversial laws have been suspended when the Attorney-General of the United States intervenes.
This has led to a partial reduction of negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the submission of identity cards with photographs.
Nevertheless, the new rules which had entered into force would undoubtedly make the exercise of the electoral right in the 2012 elections difficult.
Democraticists condemn the biases of laws that have been passed, seeing in them a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Centre report demonstrates that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election panel to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to state with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
It is only certain that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the United States democracy system.
Scanning cancer of preconceived gland: passing the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces false results, false or sometimes false negative results that result in useless medical interventions.
Men and those who are reluctant to undergo dissertation have even more doubts about it.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked two specialists.
Studies in the United States have found numerous cases of infection among the study groups, and the data are therefore difficult to interpret and it is difficult to produce clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found different mortality rates for patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis being 30-40 per cent higher than that of those who did not have screening.
So I would recommend a 50-year-old test, or 40-year-old, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and dramatic.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer, offering him options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, but, in these cases, in favour of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive or a threat to life.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
More and more, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
So I'd recommend a test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether or not this test should be performed.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movemberg has developed a tool to assess everything for and against the PSA test.
This document (to be available soon) can be found at http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the best way to reduce the risk of illness remains to maintain healthy lifestyles.
It is believed that if all people were healthy enough to eat and move, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
“If no one had smoked any more, that would have increased to at least 50 per cent,” says André Bolier, secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplainable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It has caused tremendous harm to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says Secretary André Bolier.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after smoking declines the risk of dying from cancer.
Weight
According to KAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fatty and straight intestines, food, pancreas, and uterus.
“Study shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer a thick intestines” is added to the Association.
Eating
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much quantities, it increases the risk of a fat intestinal cancer.
Kolbasin products should also be avoided.
Reservation of meat by digging, drying or salinity may result in the formation of cancerous substances.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vetamines
In recent years many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at this point, the results of these studies are not uniform.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of the cancer of simplicity, the other had the opposite effect.
The impact on vitamin D cancer development is also not fully clear.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss with a doctor his concerns and family animones.
"Study doesn't lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in Details
Last summer the report that scientists may have been able to detect the Boson of Higgs, caused real poaching — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle that was predicted in the Standard Model -- our best or, in any case, “the name of a imperfect” description of the nature and behaviour of the mother -- but which was not previously detected by experience.
But the physicists are not yet fully convinced that it is the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very much like the Higgs Boson, as predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet fully reliable.
Imagine what it is about Higgs' Boson, because the chances of error seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
Nothing can pass this rule, not even try too hard, or you can hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it also has one law of this nature: Pauli's exclusion principle, which suggests that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” is a “state” that is, in general, some of their characteristics.
From this standpoint, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good - luck citizens called farms, who wisely submit to Pauli’s principle.
In another, there are bosons, a vile band of Anarchists, who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can stay calm at the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the fact that it is totally unexplored) Particulus Adventure Laboratory of Burkley, these bosons are in turn divided into two groups: the mezones that we are not talking about here, and the “parties of the force” by which the main forces of nature and some of them are called Higgs Boson.
These are the very bosses, and we should emphasize not all the exotic things that could be thought of.
In fact, if you manage to read this chrynic, it's because of one incredibly man-made bathball: a photon, or a part of the light, which is a "survey" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it breaks down the electromagnetic field at that particular place, like a rock thrown into a pond.
This "violation" gives birth to an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon -- and therefore one of the "power carrier" bombs.
A more stable field
The same thing happens to the Higgs Boson, only the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be broken to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is far more stable than the electromagnetic field; to build it, it has to be reached with very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerationer like the one that is operating in CERN - the Grand Adronal Collider, a 27-km ring! - to achieve such enormous energy.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the Mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, work together, others not: paper, for example, will never hold onto the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have a mass, whereas others (as photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "can we bring" all of these studies, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to draw a gap between the results of observations and the projections of the SMs.
In addition, some of them yearn for this to happen, because the slightest inconsistencies may open the door for "new physics" and close some of the holes in Model.
The latter, to be said, still has significant flaws without suggesting any explanation for gravity or for a dark matter that forms about 80 per cent of the universe.
But until CERN found such a difference.
Effects
The use of these studies for the daily life of the average person would be more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that he does not exist.
See: In the early 1960s, laser research pioneers in Bella laboratories could not even suggest what a revolution would call their work.
They've anticipated their applications in science, but no more.
Indeed, a late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bella Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960 and himself developed the first continuous laser (presumptively pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a "big-scraper."
Imagine...
In addition, an annex can be found for a research aider.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not originally intended, now serves as a "light" for all digital cameras of the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
This, of course, doesn't mean that the work of the Great Adronal Collider is going to change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, what can happen.
Pallivative aid is the best way to die...
The Commission recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life for a worthy death in Quebec.
The debate should soon resume, and a draft law was being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Dorg tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monteres.
The cancer of simplicity that destroyed it from inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed of Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter in Belize, where he arrived on the eve of the day.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to get ready," he says.
The disease works — an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the restroom and even eating yourself.
He gives up and agrees that he will be helped to take food.
He's worried, even able to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him medicine, to the bathroom.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest wish for me to be cured of diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"As we live, we are taught that a man should be able to stand by," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the Victoria-Gadbua shelter.
Reclassify to the state of the child - for some tolerable humiliation.
"All depends on the capacity of the individual" to deal with the fall, he argues.
Because many people who care for palliative care feel that important developments are taking place in the midst of this decline.
Patients who come to the Viktor Gadbu's palliative shelter are all cancers.
For a maximum of three months, their predictions have given them life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more help, called “leaning”.
Ms. A., 89, was most afraid to die of "sufficient consciousness".
But my illness made it possible for me to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before she lets her put in a mask to facilitate breathing.
She still awaits her last visit from Italy in the coming days.
The Viktor Gadbua shelter, with the help of a group of volunteers, provides body care and nutrition assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
That's very little because sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or emotionally.
The dying person will agree to provide the oral strips of brandy or pepsi, even though he may ask.
We don't have diabetes anymore to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H.'s beer, who died tonight.
In the morning his son was drinking that beer in his feet at the dead man's feet.
“We help our loved ones, just like our patients, ” says Natalie Sawar, director of care for the sick.
There's no day like the previous one in Victor Gadbu's shelter.
Near the 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, laying down on his pillows during a toast in his honour, the tragic death of a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children, and having tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victoria Gadbu shelter come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are thought to simply lack access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of the sick who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbu's shelter and the Society for palliative Care at the home of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
This great gap in Quebec ' s health system has led many palliative doctors to fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and assistance in suicide.
Since October, he has been circulating a manifesto signed by the ointment lights, Dr. Balfour Maunt, and Dr. Bernard Laupunt, who disagree with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, - she says - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance office in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to make them easier.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hope of surviving Ellen Richard was already minimal when she stopped suffocating chemotherapy.
When I told my hospital that I was running out of treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was going to quit the fight, which she said.
She told me she was my own.
No total care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death are due to medical personnel for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team has made their pain easier.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not completely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Big Montreal Society, patients are not sensitive to eight percent of the cases.
At the very end of their life, doctors often resort to palliative work, where a patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or from time to time.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more people who cannot cope with pain can have access to palliative sedatives.
The sick always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia" to mean "I want to make it easier."
The establishment of this report was made possible by the journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund collectors and experts on the Italian mob every day relate what they know about the enormous “system” that confuses the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobies.
“Industry”, which was very expensive for Quebec’s taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how the system breaks up after all the money has been put into action, jokes Jacque Duchenno, deputy officer and former police chief of Montreal."
It was because of him that a scandal struck in 2011 as a side-by-side result of the investigation of the official construction contracts in Quebec, at which the Prime Minister of the time agreed very reluctantly from the liberals, Jean Share.
The Dusheno Report has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," if some had held back their instincts.
The Charbono Commission has “served two mayors” and adds, hoping that it will be able to “open the individual schemes”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was involved with a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the special unit Molot, which, after 2009, forced Montreal's “strate” card, to cease to overstate the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotta, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Wyyankur, recently resigned from the position of Mayor Lavala, the third largest city in Quebec Province.
He is suspected of having received bribes on several occasions when the State orders are placed.
In addition, a number of Italian-born engineers, including Tony Accrao and Lino Zambit, have been formally charged with reporting to Montreal and Italian construction contractors.
The last one blew up the real bomb by investigating the "system" of government contracts.
Over the years, Zambil gave 3 per cent of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a mob broker who, in turn, transferred the money from the party of Mayor Géral Tramble, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambitas fell money to the right and to the left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various provinces, mostly liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Excess sewage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system was working irrefutablely.
The former civil construction engineer, George Surprenne, described it in detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the cost of which he had increased.
Other road construction officials admitted to have received 30-40 per cent in excess of their accounts through false additions.
Then, an organizer of the mayor ' s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party ' s castes with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, dropping Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal who had been alarmed.
The mayor of the Rivier de Prari district, in the east of the island, has been in opposition since 2010 to the sale of a five million-million-dollar municipal property sold for... 1.6 million construction workers in the midst of a building boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that, in an investigation that will eventually begin, she “will follow a string that makes her mind aware of the functioning of the system that is infested with ants to stop the gangrene and determine the perpetrators”.
This process is described as “a painful but positive one”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices.
How we get out of here.
Regularly.
Jacque Dusheno, for his part, observes that “workers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the manipulations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the Quebec election campaign was 70 per cent, he was joking: "I was told it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Québec suggests limiting up to $100 a donation to the parties, but he says it will not change the situation: “Unless we strictly limit the costs of the election, there will be dirty money in politics”.
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of state contracts and party financing: “We cannot fall below; we are bravely involved in the matter, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard ...
"U.S. is not the FK of Barcelona!"
During this season, you made an unexplored move in the SCW.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be attributed to individual consciousness, but it may also be to a new dimension of the SCW.
Big players arrived.
I'm growing up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also brought much.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
Everything's going on very fast in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning, I've always moved forward in the pre-trial training center at the NIF in Clerfen until my arrival in St. Estienne.
So you benefit from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotty...
To complete this summer is not a very high-level match to play in the news.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads a player like me to want to be at the level and get out at the top.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's helped by alternates like Claude Maquell, who played in the same position as I am.
Anchelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Anchelotti is being respected by all technical personnel.
Today, he has no equal in the First League and is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high school clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I left a whole series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PPP season?
The First League of Lyons took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of champions: we've been effective in one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as we can go.
It's all right now.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
First we want to finish the first time in our group, in front of Porto, in order to be able to accept the response match in one eighth of the finals.
Can PSW become the first-class European club in the short run?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needed to win titles and maintain a long-term position.
Today, it's not like that.
Financially, the ASW has the means to make the project real.
Will it be a big failure to take the title of the First League as it was last season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to have this championship.
We were close to this last season.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to finish.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Usually, 79 points mean that the championship is called.
But another team, Monpelj, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Although strong teams such as Marseilles, Lyons and Bordeaux were involved in the struggle for titles, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSW?
It's normal that much is expected of us, given how much we have invested and what players we have.
We're ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win at home 4-0 vs. Trua and we're still in trouble, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are expecting first of all from us.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with an account of 4-0.
We're not FK Barcelona!
We're trying to run a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We've proved in the League of champions that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to go to one eighth of the final two seasons, although they have also spent enormous sums of money!
Given the amounts invested, we have represented you 15 points in advance by a winter break.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyons and Marseilles, who were not high in the past season, were “cultivated” by this new FAR.
This shows how fascinating the first League is.
I hope in May we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we have won.
The SS seems totally dependent on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
Well, what if they say that there's something called "Zlatanity."
It just means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he loses a lot of his head.
He's here and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a big player and a great star on a global scale.
In the group, we respect him as a human and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
It stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, one of the world's best advocates, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France's collecting?
It's a disappointment.
I was eager to share in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from losing some playtime.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got more out of there.
Today, I'm able to play good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized by the Sons.
We have learned lessons from what has happened in Ukraine and must now be exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deshama's first month in charge of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the selection team at the championship of the world.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspires them to win.
What Laurent Blan was like.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan accomplished his goal, and he qualified us for Europe.
I hope Didier Descham will bring the sons to Brazil.
The good-deserved nudity (1-1) that was razed on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career had no matches like that.
Pay and sell without bank - with Bitcoin
Quite contrary to the current cash exchange, based on centro-banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties and the fees for processing them.
Furthermore, as these technologies often happen, a clear political vision is that the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakakomoto (symbol) is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted to dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent exchange protocol that allows the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites are used for donations or as a means of payment.
After reaching a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, the rate fell to $2, five months later, before returning today to about $10 (trincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world’s exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency published in October had taken an interest in this system.
He describes balcane as "the most successful virtual currency", "concursing with a dollar or a euro", and "as usual currencies."
Biotwin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to advance video games that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Betkokin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of bookkeeping, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two electronic addresses like email.
For each new payment alone, the user may select another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the pieces used in the transaction are in fact available in the public account book sent throughout the network.
The registration of the new transaction in the book is a key step.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
It's about the embossing phase of the file, that is, converting a big file into digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number before "hush" together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (some zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other knots easily check that it is correct.
Transactions thus result in the chain of all other transactions in a continuous way; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would wish to pay twice as much as ten minutes, and the subject would like to be paid with money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would not have been confirmed since they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that did the job gets 50 people.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is regularly divided by half, possibly by the end of 2012.
The number of bactans is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with an increase in the computational power.
The life of the network has already survived ups and downs.
Bitscoin sites were attacked and the remains were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used is not related to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nousa, who recently launched Paymium, a real money company using the Beatcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPres blog form, are allowed.
Adei Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel recently analysed the account book and found that almost 80 per cent of the Cubans are not in circulation.
The giant sales were declared in November.
"Thir thousand dollars have been traded," welcomes Jon Holmkwist, who works at Coinabul, who converts the coffers into gold.
Pierre Nousa, another author of the currency allowance, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contractable payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Beatcoin to check transactions, which is therefore cheaper.
The holder has better control over his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough to tell you the address that can be taken and identified by the phone, says Pierre Nouz, making sure he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Where the Beatcoin will be approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, expects, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be increased today if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capeta and Subbi).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future rather than hope for us.
Most of us were affected by Afghan peasants whom we considered to be terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though the Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks join them.
They're suffering, sometimes they're helped by local rebels, but they won't be able to do it any longer as the West becomes more sensitive.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijb base, which I observed from the heights of the hills of the small villages, thanks to French credit, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from a period of irresistibly moving from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their country control was then perceived as a form of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, where Al-Qaida was overpowered, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former Mujahedas, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into public land looters in order to resold them under the construction of returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the enormous US subcontracts of subcontracting.
They are discredited; most of them have, by the way, not even fought themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that's not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have enjoyed American generosity, that capital outflows mean.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls alike.
The workplaces of these young people, who will not want to return to the darkness of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders, should be provided.
All, including armed militants, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
At present, there is an army.
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate?
Senior commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who do not submit to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent by Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with strong presidential power, as the Prime Minister, who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on the feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority has been given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that the Western countries were there just to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Ainak media, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to do away with a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports one day, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French military units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the retention of traditional assistance: girls, boys, the French School of University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence, which had been abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous social and agricultural activities in dozens of mountain villages.
This effort, with the active involvement of local workers, was able to help to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and increased land area.
What do we keep in mind, spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Katafá province.
To get rid of the riots led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, they needed a little non-military support that would be well controlled and directly directed.
Heavy Generations of the Egyptian Constitution
This is the new risky step taken by President Mohammed Murcy.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a wa-bank.
Having won all the ranks, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
For two years now, Egypt had relied on a preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which had weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persisted in his "atisfying," continuing to "inviolate the word" and "failure the law".
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should take place within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that makes the Brothers abandon their intention to explain the Egyptian text, the article after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while frustration is raging throughout the country.
Muhammad Morris seems convinced that the Egyptian people are going to vote in a positive way, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time magazine.
Even so, the call for an accelerated vote is based on an ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “If you vote in favour of my text, or I am leaving an extraordinary power”, which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutional Assembly, most of the Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most Liberians did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had to fight the door, feeling unable to reach their point of view.
The same has been done by representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, the 11 participants in the reserve were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
No wonder most of the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, lost sight of the fact that one of the few differences of day had arisen around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the times of the Constitutive Assembly were wrong.
The text on which the vote was held yesterday is 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 eventually remained the identical article of the 1971 Constitution, stating that “Shariah principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
'Lycemerie', the liberals that only see the pyar are responding.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt’s expert, Sofia Pomeier, this is alarming, as “people who are designed to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the origin of the theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next Rector of this university seems to be less moderate than the present.
“There is currently no concrete religious intervention.
We remain under civil law with this Constitution.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not intellectuals, but university students, some were trained in the French system,” says Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “all along article 220, there may be ambiguousness as the terms used in it are derived from a religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to “fix” [Islamic jurisprudence, p.c.].
In the future, the question may arise as to how competent civilian judges are to rule on this matter.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have fallen significantly compared with those under the old regime.
Another point of dispute is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will take place, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor would the trial of civilians in the military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be destructive to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been maintained, and insults that may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, and especially for freedom of the press, are now prohibited.
In addition, no more articles speak of the protection of a woman, stressing Heba Morayaf, of Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of State will, in turn, leave the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists wait for holy places, the Pup of the Earth, and the sea from the POL
The Promised One combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern - day comforts, and the primordial nature of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should go to Israel.
Worshiping Holy Places
It is worth the journey into the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace is due to all who enter this bribe.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: turning water into wine into a wedding feast, camping, storm calming, and network filling.
Here, then, Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all the festivals in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here walk on the road of Scorby or the cross - road of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doroza).
It begins at the anchorages of Antonia - Pretoria, where there was judgment, and on the streets of the Old City, it brings to the Temple of the Holy Sept.
There is, however, a symbolic Christian landpe that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be built in a place where Christian legend has grown a tree from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem has the most holy place for Jews, Stan Plach, who stayed from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes that are later fulfilled.
Make the journey vertical
Massad's strengths were left in secret safe haven from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high cliffs in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
Only those who are attracted to altruism can reach them.
The rest of us on this historic summit carry a rope climber.
And in the north of the country, at a height of 1600 to 2040, there is a famous mountain resort, Hermon, where in the winter months, there is a huge influx of tourists.
A bus shuttle brings to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the footways is 45 km.
In old times, pagan gods were said to have lived on top of the mountain.
Visit a Unique Museum
There are about 300 museums in that country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are to visit.
Among them are the Israeli Museum, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the deserts of Judah, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
He's also supposed to go to the Arts Museum in Tel Aviv.
His exhibits include an impescionist and espressonist canvas, Moné, Pissarro, Renuara, Cezanne, Sislay, Matisse, Modillian, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al-Basha Museum, which is a series of halls of old Turkish baths with its nests of visitors and banks of that time.
In Cesaria, we should go to a unique Ralli private museum where we can enjoy the sculptures of Dal and Rodena.
There's no tour guide or gift store.
The entry is free and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth is the Holocaust Museum or the Yad Yours in Tel Aviv, which tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children ' s memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it, you end up in perfect darkness.
Stars are coming.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they were killed are narrowed down.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
You're welcome.
Israel ' s three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has basins, boreholes, deltas and oceans.
Interestingly, even during the winter months, the Red Sea is purchased because its temperature is not less than 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is warmed to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it buys for a year.
By the way, it is the world's most exclusive sea at the lowest point on the planet, 417 meters below the ocean level.
The lascourous water in it is a pellets that can easily be kept out of the water without even being able to swim.
It's really beautiful to go around.
They're going here to treat salt water -- powders and whole mud, and to treat the health of cymbals, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthrates, bronchets, sugar diabetes, to bring the nerves that are broken.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient History
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it was a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
It is here that Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The Turkish people love to beg for the small streets named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls of your "his" sign on the street, Fortuna will be kind.
In Jaffa, there are young people coming from all Israel and even from other countries to the photo session.
And in Cesaria, the city of King Herod, you can ride through the Roman theater, "take away" the strength of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period Cesarea was the principal city of Judah and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The restored theater is now being used for evening concerts and opera shows.
The Tourist on the Notes
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population, they know Russian.
It is better to take money to travel, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to trade in shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa has the only metro line of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground payout.
Travel in all urban transport costs 6 shekels, which can be replanted for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated by Jewish tradition.
From Friday night till sundown, markets, shops, public transportation are stopped on Saturday.
And on Sunday morning, a work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher food, which excludes pigs, seafoods, fish without shrubs, and dishes that combine milk with meat.
It offers a wide range of dishes made of lambs and beefs, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, the traditional Jewish shepherd fur, a variety of sauces, bees of hammer - mouthdle, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fattened cats that's fucking "sucking in themselves."
At night, they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Ants love people's places and don't give up the fun.
Rental of a car, depending on mark, will range from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance side is $15 per day.
And a ride of the bike is going to be in 15 glasses a day.
Museum tickets are 30 shekels on average.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists worldwide.
U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine were among the most travelers.
There were 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists on the Earth from January to October 2012, 51 per cent more than the 2010 figure, before the exit of visas on 9 February 2011.
The "great and powerful" to Moscow will prove that migrants are digging money into language
As long as deputies and human rights defenders argue that they will give the law on compulsory language testing, frauds selling “persons” certificates have already emerged.
Each year, 13 million Garatbytes arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of these citizens in Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families who remain in their homeland.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force that requires every migrant worker to pass the Russian test.
As long as this is in force, it is only for those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing, household and retail trade.
In time, however, the FIU promises that tests will be binding on all arrivals.
Overcrowding will require not only language but also Russian history, but also the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for both obtaining and extending work permits.
Exclusion only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not apply, and people who have obtained a certificate of education and a degree prior to the break-up of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Love, impartiality and protection of rights
The network of examination posts will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MoU, the PBC and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities, and more than 160 such centres have now been opened in Russia.
Members of the Gosduma and the FMC supported the testing initiative.
And the human rights defenders, before the law entered into force, have been able to ask the press many times: What does that actually do?
What will change the permanence of the language for both Russians and Russians?
First of all, the migration officials are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “work slavery”.
A lot of people now talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, and they explain to the head of the Russian FMC office in Tajikistan, Victor Self-Government.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without profession, education, language that does not have a medical examination.
Without understanding of language, I am certain that the future migrants will be confronted with the unscathed people who, by the appearance of the word, will bring him into a horrible, tight barracks, where he and dozens of such things will be washed for months without food and documents, up to 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“In their country, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, taken out passports, paid no wages,” confirms the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of ICLIM Tolib Charip.
Don't fight, officer!
However, as long as many citizens in the Middle Asian Republic who are going to work in Russia are admitted, not only do they not know the language of the country they seek to, but they also write for their own hard work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as a disaster: few Turks, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even to receive a false primary education.
For their families, it is not even necessary to feed their children, let alone dress them, educate them, and sanctify them.
As a teenager, such young ones go to work at the very earliest opportunity.
It's hard if they don't know the language, they admit.
"You feel inferior and incomplete."
It is true that there is an important point in the law on the language of human rights defenders.
The test will be performed only for those migrants with legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent formal employment.
In the meantime, most of the Haitians still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or I'm sorry."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is that there are bureaucratic obstacles and other linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs between 12 and 16,000 rubles.
And here's a false registration that can be done quickly and in just half a thousand years.
The members of the Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registrations, hence extortions.
"A request for a hundred, two cigarettes, a tea," shared with Tajikistan's journalists, Uded Hushadamov.
"Go on, don't bite, buy pictures."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "ly" language test certificates have already been removed by the FI.
The fake paper is printed on a typical color printer.
Of course, the new owners had not been able to do so, and each of the migrants who were hoping to facilitate the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is two times the value of the formal test procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
In that the main task soon is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “shorts” cannot simply be bought, brought together by the authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities may promise a range of gametes who have not been successful in testing at the first time, to learn the basic language course.
In addition, work in areas that do not involve active communication with people will be offered to visitors who do not know Russian.
MLI does not take up the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To use shootings at weddings when there was no victim, and a slaughter by Moscow lawyer, Dmitri Winogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to prohibit injuries in public places and raise the age at which they can obtain a licence for weapons from 18 years to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the thinking committee on security and anti-corruption, Irena Jarov, and promised that the arms law would be amended in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "gucking up."
An open letter was received from the network, the authors of which are representatives of various social small-scale organizations, who are required to abandon the “unsolicited tightening”.
The percentage of reported-arranged-arranged-arranged-arranged-arranged-arranged-arms-assist Vasili Lesnikov, stated to the R.B.B.A.'s Office.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in six months of 2012, there were 142 offences involving firearms registered in the internal affairs agencies, compared to 1,168,000 in the same period.
The authors of an open letter are confident that the tightening of civil-arm legislation does not prevent the offender from entering the black market.
Now they say we can find in Moscow any weapon at a very low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to monitor the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Providers: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through several channels.
The principal channel is five, reports Colonel Victor Baranette, who has worked for ten years within the Ministry of Education and Gentaba.
Skensht site that takes orders for arms
The first is “armies or military traces”, that is, weapons that were stolen during hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The Russians and the Russian officers, and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranette.
The next form of black weapons is stolen by criminals from power agencies.
The Baranian explains that the police warehouses are included and that the officers of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Illegal “units” are sold out of military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had explosions.
“There are proven versions that part of the fires has been made specifically - to cover up the shortage”, says the former military.
The gun manufacturers, according to Branca, make their contribution.
“In the meantime, private weapons factories are bearing fruit, which do not withstand competition in the international market and release weapons from the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
The use of guns and assault rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, is particularly high.
"There's its production, sometimes artisanal, and there's a mob that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where's the gun from?
The experts considered that the proportion of each source of illicit arms to the black market was close to that of the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Public Management Design Centre.
Experts analysed the accounts of the MIC and Rosstat, criminological literature and open portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers and come from the army and the military.
Half of all weapons in the black market were found “on account of the officials whose work was related to the weapons”, as stated in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of cases of theft during the arms production phase, and 5 per cent are from “black archaeology”.
One of the weapons store salesmen who asked him not to call his name, assured him that the weapons found by black cops had been found for a long time without anyone buying it were too old.
More often than not, he says, at the new lot the sellers are going to the military warehouse.
A person buys a unit through a flager, such as a TT gun.
He's going to sign it out, pass it through the fence.
"He's transporting her to town and he's selling 900 euros here for a thing with two shops," he says.
“The truth is, the police are aware of all cases, so, periodically, when a crime-disclosure plan is being burned, a consultant adds the purchase to the traffickers of illegal weapons.”
Like in a luxury store.
The seller and the buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a friend who's asked me to come to the Boja platform, where there's a person who's going to take me to the coals, where we're going to trade.
The price of a gun I only found out there.
Military examiner Victor Baranette
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, and she says, "I've got one of these, but I'm not sure about it.
The sellers are in the market, but you have to come in too, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivan Ivanovich who asked me to say that the daughter's teeth have gone out."
I'm getting a couple of castes right now because of a person I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it to him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Victor Baranette tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on this for publication.
The Schemes, he said, haven't changed.
He was given a picture album where there was "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the military.
The bite, according to Barranza, doesn't offer a cat in a bag, everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, not just buying -- we're going with a seller in the woods, we're putting a target.
"I've been given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is beating well, starting to trade," describes the expert's procedure.
The grave on the couch
Internet searches are put on websites and groups in Vkontakte, where they propose buying weapons for different purposes.
No documents or personal meetings are needed to do this.
"It's enough to have some amount of money," they write in an advertising cap on the website "Tap a gun or an automatic."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
And will minors be sold?
"No license," he asks the user Ivan (orfography retained).
I'm using TT.Moscow, and I'm writing down the Fedoren's request.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of underground sites and wants to buy war weapons with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish on the mat, and then they reach the coal in Siberia.

I have heard of these schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payments through the bank.
“In response, photos and instructions are sent to the press secretary of the public organization entitled “Right to Weapons” by Dimitria Kysov.
Viktor Baranette claims to have left the application on the site, could be left without a gun, and gone to jail.

"People walk like a hungry fish on the mat, and then they reach the corner in Siberia," he claims.
Macro for $100.
Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be made in the purchase of illicit small arms.
According to Demetrius Kislova of The Right to Weapons, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
Wait a month or so.
It is shipped from a long-term management warehouse of these medium-sized warehouses.
At the official statistics of the agencies, the number of such crimes generally decreased by 7 per cent in Russia from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the U.S., there are artifacts and supermarkets.
As a result of its work, McDonalds reaches a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days there has been a wave of protest in America against low wages in the department of the Walmart Corporation and restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as McAdonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Uendis and Kentuky Falde Chikin.
As long as no one has to predict whether the wave will turn into a ninth shaft or whether it is going to get blown up in the early stages.
The actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages that are paid to ordinary employees of the Walmart and the fast food system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
This sector of the economy is not yet covered by trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares started last week, after Day of thanks, on the so-called Blue Friday, when America was hit by cheap sales, taking over millions of customers and sometimes accompanied by cobblers.
On that day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and played with trade unions and the left-wing activists of a corporation whose goods are distributed to people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from mills, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuums, eggs and milk.
The average product in its shops is 8 per cent to 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Many low-paid employees are therefore excluded from their jobs.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of autoloaders or hand scanners.
Share participants in Blue Friday demanded a higher salary and sedated that the value of the company's health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 per hour, this consumption isn't for his pocket, they say.
Scientists at the University of California in Burkley prove that if Walmart were to raise his average salary to $12 per hour, that would cost corporations $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1 percent more than she's spending on pay right now.
If Walmart is able to shift the wages to the customer's shoulder, every trip to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they'll spend $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart's supporters are quite saying that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any minor damage to corporations.
The Blue Friday continued in her shops from 8 p.m. to noon the following day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, her cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on the Day Friday.
The representative of Dan Bogelman claimed in an interview with Huffington Post that the workplaces had left a total of “less than five” Walmart staff, and that the protest was a mere ‘ordinary piatric trick” of the union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by the Walmart store (they are not complained of in this progressive town, and so they are not yet there), but by McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
Mandonalds says he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you sick people and pay you for honest work!
Juan Williams, a member of the New York Harbour
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Rapid diet records increase it over time, but few, and on average, their regular employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one earns them less in this expensive city.
How can we live in New York for that kind of money, for me?
Once, Magdonalds had been passing through almost a quarter of American teenagers who had been working for their post-school stalls while living with their parents.
Few have seen this basic source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly being interviewed by McAdonalds workers who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed on their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal newspaper forum, the author of the commentary observes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protests that began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McAdonalds on the 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and ambulance cooks begin paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing the members of the trade union movement with fads and dismissals.
On the other hand, the Administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is also difficult to reach the fast food trade for objective reasons.
One of the main is the unexpired turnover of personnel.
Non-consensual
The violent protests took place on that day and at several other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
It came at the middle of the day's meeting at McDonalds near Times Square, where several localdemocratic politicians spoke, in particular a member of the Jumein Williams Hillary, who said, "Macdonalds" says that he sells billions of pieces, and he then doesn't even give you hospital care and doesn't pay you for honest work."
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York democracies, for example, the mayor's candidate Bill De Blessio, who stated that “we should be friendly in supporting fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair payment and economic well-being that each New York City deserves.”
As described by New York Times, this was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food sector.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, but not all of them were state-of-the-art staff, where tens of thousands of people are employed in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark of mass traffic will produce a flame.
"As long as the brain is deceived, it's average."
The subject of an updated reality that has been popular among modern technology worshipers has recently been adopted largely through the prism of the eye.
First, at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the relevant patent.
However, a conversation with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft Sharm Izadi College in Cambridge shows that the points covered for scientists in this company are a stage.
They are manned by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general terms, what's your research team doing?
- We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind is stuck in the swaths of work with peaks on the flat screen, sometimes the tyrants in them with their finger.
We want to look 5-10 years forward and anticipate the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in sign management.
- What else is going on?
- Despite the fact that Kinect brought interaction to the physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We're trying to change this, working on a really three-dimensional representational system based on different technologies, including design systems.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, making it more tangible.
To do that, however, it is important to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And first of all, the stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a private issue, because it doesn't always want to tell others about its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers is good, but everyone's down there.
For example, we had a project to manage public places where we thought about gestures, but not about cluttering, but about such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, gestures were taken, not by a camera of the device, but by a hand-cuffed triangle that fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
While it's large, it can be reduced theoretically to hours per hour.
But the future of the combined management type, for example, is a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You tell me and you'll show me at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the car can or can at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to define more accurately the human response.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, it gives good permission deep down, it's very important.
- What about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims for today's cameras?
Missing permits, depths or anything?
- In principle, the present generation is what we can draw from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it'd be good to get megapiles 8 at a speed of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, and this adds work to the designers of the algorithms.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y-axis, but the Z-axis.
It's also very important the speed, the number of personnel per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the present 30 k/s are very small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our Randmond laboratory made a sensor for controlled processing, from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects human and machine interaction.
I'd be very useful in my work to the equivalent of such a device, but I don't need a touch so that the personnel per second will be bigger.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three "camers", one of which is actually an infrared detector, and the other has a reflectional signal receiver.
And then the third camera is actually the common sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog to Kinect, play with the distortion of the cameras and see how this would help in a three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As you can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think, in terms of everyday use of the technology of the added reality of points, that's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's always fun, holding a smartphone in your arms, not very convenient, but what I think is that the coolest version would be a "transmitted" reality where, on the basis of the cloud platform, you could switch from the glasses to the smartphone, the projection display, all over the world.
Eyeglasses are a very personal device, in which their power (only you see domestic things) and at the same time weakness - completed reality through eye-to-faces will prevent you from working on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of the Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that has often been criticized by critics: There is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group ' s answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is that it's the seventh in terms of a breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactical feelings.
Now, one of the interesting tricks is using a second hand as a substrate for the image.
She's a great push recorder!
But there are also technologies that really aim to make these cards in the air tangible -- for example, the interference of several directional ultraviolet beams at a certain point where the finger is sitting -- but as long as it's very weak -- as if you've been hit on your pillows.
And there's lifts on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers -- there's also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels something like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There's another task that has to be faced for a long time -- how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he's on open, almost endless -- working on the concepts of running paths (not like clubs), moving platforms, and huge layers.
While the brain is being deceived, the work has been done for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things in a completely increte state.
The taste instead of culture is Rosbalt.ru.
The "Rosbalt" is continuing with the Petersburg Avangard project on citizens who are just ahead of them in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list has already hit the brightest pieces of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing universal knowledge.
The new hero "Rosbalta" is an elegant artist, Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kiryl Miller, a bearded man dressed in all the reds, who meets the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, on fancy shoes and camels.
Kiryl Miller's paintings always collect spectators wherever they stand.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Pierburgn socio-philophosian fairy tales that create new mythology.
Kirill Miller is the bright man of theherburg vanguard of the late 1980s, the early '90s.
He is also a city man, his appearance on the streets, a smiling citizen, who is uplifting his mood.
He had recently taken a scarb and had become a Peerburger because he had created for this complex role all his god - given existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why do you still go around town in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a model with a view and an image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although in society everything that is slightly non-circumcision is causing aggression and failure.
But my provocations are about to start talking.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in Nevsky DD, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old, free, informal artists passed, and the new, free types I didn't understand.
I became friends with the artists of a new wave, with a post-grazing wave that led to "Pukskin-10," and there was no more waves.
I'm thrown into theaters, clothes, music, all the ladies, except for the words.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the center of Peterburg culture, where all the best creative forces were to come together.
In 1995, I took the territory to Pusczyn-10 and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a god ' s club, a house of the Herrburg god.
Many were born there: Nomas, Tequila Jazz, remembering that Schnoura was brought to the "Uho Van Gogh" project.
Schuner and his friends sang under the fan with light songs, and they were in a tighter trip, including a fashionable composer named Igor Vdowin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has been leading many programmes until the hali-Ghali era.
We gave them Trahtenberg, and he got his big career, and he got his basic education and education.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboeds Club is a reference from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and all the people left.
I'm the hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City."
I was named at the Year's Monday, and my culmination was over.
In new times, old rules make it uncomfortable to work, and I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
It's easy to become popular in today's years, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is marked by a recognized manner.
- Many of my paintings are faggots, they have a very well-spoken relevance and urgency.
I'll have a software exhibit, the Russian Museum in clowns.
Clowns are an extra-temporary category.
I used to be social, and now being like this is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything's going on. Tragism's getting off.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian change by order.
The clothing is now set on outside the mechanics rather than on the inner person.
Maybe he can't put his hand in and spit in his mouth.
And falsehood will be removed with the help of a transplant.
- And recently, we saw you as a city boxer.
They're not like me to be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- The commercial art must now be neat, tactical, sweet.
Cultural disintegration is in progress.
People used to get trapped in the stables, and Goddess of one kind, of simples of another.
Now everyone's broken up into micro-socials, it's hard for everybody to like.
I'm not a big-time bum, so everyone likes me.
We need to think who you like right now.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stas Mikhaylov comes for several thousand!
- He's got throws coming, and there's a sex and social sphere working.
And on the cultural soil, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and eventually fewer management, money, everything comes in.
I have a fan, the main thing is, they won't be deceived, they won't ruin what I've been through.
I used to write these pictures in my youth that one collector had them on the wall next to Falc and Larion.
I started with paintings that normally end.
Now, things are often confused.
They say that culture is spiritual, that it's a culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a member of the culture of yesterday, and I grew up with the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money for painting.
I'm for such a culture.
- Kirill, what's in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an official from culture.
But not all of them have a culture.
When the kings were right, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they're stuck, because they need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
And Erarta, but they're different from what they're honestly saying that not all the contemporary art we're taking is artists who are supposed to look for themselves in other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil.
And on our stones, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people curious in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this broken dot.
We need to make fine art, as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
Spaceships with earthships on board are going to search for a remote planet.
In order to preserve mankind, the main question arises, How can we continue our family in the face of obsessiveness or on the same reserve planet?
I think there's no choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be resuscitated, at least in a hypothetical way.
"It's Venus and Mars," he says, "as Senior Fellow of the State Astronomical Institute, P. K. Sternberg (GAIS), Vladimir Surdin.
But if in Mars conditions are more fit for life, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
Life can only be lived at high altitude or in Venus's orbit... in space.
The reproductions in space started with flora.
More than half a century ago, plants were experimented with.
Four generations of peas raised in orbit were in no way different from their ground varieties.
Then you'll have insects in orbit, tiny fruit flies of the pedophile.
In 1979, the eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo is developing under weariness.
We're getting a completely normal customer on exit.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem that this bird has to find resistance is to stand on its legs and move,” explains Ar Vladimir Sachiv, head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Affairs (IMBP).
Without resistance, the birds jostled disorderly.
And 10 hours later, babies had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to the light and sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they just died.
"And twice we've been fooling the birds, and then we've refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," says an experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sachiv.
With animals, the last time biological "minig" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
But there's only one-person people on the Bion biospore.
There was an experiment with rats who were already sent to space with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been found there.
"It was just biosputs, but again it's the only experiment, and that's what we need to do," says Vladimir Sachiv.
After the landing, the space rats had a progeny.
But it's not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
The living things, the lost, the habit of living, just can't do their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, may in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
On ethical grounds, no such experiments are carried out.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Teserkov.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our Teac is gone, and no one on Earth can say whether it will stay after it's gone into space.
Whether she's gonna have a baby after this flight.
"No one answered that question," says Wachtang Wacnydze, a rocket-space veteran.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut of Valentine Teceskov gave birth to a daughter.
Andrian Nikolaev's father was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, a son was born in Svetlana, the second cosmonauta of Savika, who had been in orbit twice and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have cosmonauts, who have had a healthy generation after long flights.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," the cosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valerius Polakov.
Yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, protection against radiation, artificial gravity.
The CCP Hydralator is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, astronauts are developing skills in outer space.
Water simulates ignorance.
If, for adults, the water is comfortable, but still the environment is alien, then for babies it's a natural disaster.
It's as though the little Nethinimandres are confirming that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby and her mom for about nine months in the window fluid, and it's easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from that first bath, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," says Marina Aksenov's breast-fed instructor.
In words, if the child is more natural for the child, gravity, the force of gravity, is needed for the woman.
Very quickly, the muscles of the belly, pelvis, fall into the air to extract the fruit.
All right, let's put it down, relying on stimulant stimulants.
You can, of course, go to a special room and drive him out.
"And what?" asked the intruding questions of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child needs artificial gravity as well.
Without feeling the earth’s attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
It is not possible for a newborn child to wear a special training suit as an adult.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment, which we and I are going to do, has allowed for the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled person, totally deposed human," is anticipated by the head of the IMBP Bioethics Committee on ImPRAN Egor Peots.
As long as the birth of children in space is a theory.
After a while, however, this will be a reality when the earth on its ships goes to a distant planet that will become a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit Office: The check-in of the dock system failed at the fault of the politicians.
In the public procurement industry, Czechia has good controls and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is not in the process of being applied.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented on the current situation of Kala.
Such opinions provide joint inspection of Czech and German authorities.
As an example of a wrong practice, Peter’s approach to the so-called szurz-system approach is not often.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Guardian Democratic Party) would not trouble entrepreneurs with checks - would this be prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions which are required to verify and enforce obligations”, notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on State procurement to both countries.
What exactly was that?
There is a parallel verification that we've started two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation argues how public procurement should take place, further national legislation and then the application of the law in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in an unsolicited test, there have been interesting differences - except to say, we can have the law “tracted and imperceptible”, but in the practice we have applied certain parameters to Germany.
It follows that it is not sufficient to create more and more detailed rules, but it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
How does this project actually help you, what does it mean to you?
It is precisely such joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions because this does not result in a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by lowering orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "boss" in such a way that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not diminish.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control Audit Office) or does it work differently?
With regard to institutions, there is also a panel that works slightly differently, but basically both institutions work the same way as we do.
Furthermore, powers are somewhat similar, but as Germany has a federal structure, there are audit offices and at the federal land level, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
With regard to local legislation, is it easier than we have?
Actually, I wouldn't like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it's not absolutely best at all.
Is that so because they're better at controlling?
I definitely don't, but I guess I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment, in any way, the consequences?
Given that the legal strength of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our verification work.
Since we are in fact in fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We only take this into account in the preparation of future audits - we started using our new tool of “resulting the risk of non-economicity”, through which we had spent almost 14,000 state contracts, and we analysed them, and of course these changes will occur because limitations change, some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will be beneficial or additional pressure on the bureaucratic system?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules of “stabilization” cannot be observed.
In previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
In such a case, is it appropriate to tighten the law in this way?
I think it's not that way.
The system must exclude those who wish to seize and abuse but not punish those who commit a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only exert even greater pressure on bureaucraticism.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not be concerned with business inspections of the so-called "Sz-system" system, what does that mean?
Is the "Svarz System" banned or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of bodies under the obligation to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're going to change this law and let it go," but we can't say we're gonna pretend that nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act lays down rather strict rules, as well as what should be formally carried out, which would protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best supply is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe we lack.
The roads are slippery, but most of the time they are passing.
In some Czech places roads are frozen and snowcapped.
Mostly they're passing, but somewhere with more caution.
The Carlovarian Land
This morning, roads were passing through the side of Carlovar, but some of them were frozen and snowcapped.
The temperature has dropped from 5 to 10 degrees below zero, but during the day, the temperature must be slow.
December in the region is no more than a small layer in the lowlands.
However, the Rudland ridges are about three inches [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it was known that the visibility was lower because of the fog.
The R6 road and first-class roads in the region are now without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain roads, passways.
Yet, in some areas the remains of frozen snow still lie.
It is especially important to be on high - road roads.
Pardubian and Kralovargradsky
The Czech highway and highway management on its Internet pages informs that some of the eastern Czech roads are in danger of haloda, while the high-down mountains and roads may have a layer of snow.
Airfield road workers warn drivers of the Holocaust, which may be particularly vulnerable to the highlands of Pardubian.
Hollywood may be near Lanscrouna, Usti-ad-Orlici, Policus, Switwi or High-Mito, especially on second- and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located in Switavi, are treated by chemics.
The snow is especially on the Krkonosh and the Orlician Mountains.
The snow layer is located on high-rise roads in the Richina al-Kinjno and Trrunova areas.
In East Bohemia today, there's a variable cloud without precipitation.
Temperatures typically vary between minus 3 and plus 1 degree Celsius, light wind.
Plezenian Land
The roads in the Plesen region this morning are passways, but places need to be cautious and adaptable to the weather.
In the morning the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, in some places it may be slippery.
Drivers may bump into the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
The regional road workers provided information.
Shasse D5 now travels almost without restriction, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
The southern Plzelina and Tahov may have frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and there is also a warning against the possibility of small-scale sections being opened.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomoska Edge
Drivers heading towards the highlands of Olomousk must today take into account snow cush on the road.
It remained after the chemicals were used in the Chervenor village and on the road in the direction of the Vida Krshaja.
On the night of the snowfall, road workers were forced to leave the street, according to information from the traffic department, about three inches [3 cm] of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other areas, roads tend to pass without restrictions.
"The remains of snow lie at the height of the Shumper.
Drivers heading towards Esenica are to be aware of snow coughing in the Chervenor village,” CHAN (Czech News Agency) reported today to CAN (Czech News Agency) traffic control controller.
On the night of clearing the roads, their companions from Esenica believed that the roads in the highlands had remained naked and wet after treatment of chemicals.
In Olomac roads are free to go, but in Sternmber, drivers must be alert to forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
The Ustskian Land, the Liberian Land
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some difficult places left to pass.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a few barelands or snowy areas, the mountainway is closed off the site from Telica in the Ustice Province.
The temperature also remains poor in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, especially in the south-east of the Czech Mid-east, to the contrary, there is no problem, mostly dry roads.
There is no information about road traffic complications.
Road workers report the appearance of a hoolied in the vicinity of Stetta.
According to meteorologists, at night the ideal conditions for its formation were created, raining and snow melting all day, and the sky was cleared up and frozen at night.
There are reports of adverse conditions on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border of Ustsk and Libersk.
Because of snow - covered branches of trees related to the road itself, they were forced to close the road to Telica on Kninica.
Shimon Orest, at concerts, we want positive energy.
What do you think the world should end in less than a month?
It's just one of the many alarming news that we humans are falling into so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we're constantly joking about this and say that we're the only group in the world that will be able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give a completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event that we have planned for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of Maya's calendar, which ended on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9:00, three concerts are running simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostre.
They're going to end, roughly, at a time when on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, which is 12 hours earlier than we have, is going to end in the May calendar.
Who did this idea come into the head?
It was my idea, and then we all came up with our painter Gonza Auguste.
In addition to having enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to join the public in thinking about the state of this world in which we will once pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be bought on the Web site www.e-tap.cz and thus supported.
The Tap Tap group, along with other musicians, has also performed a gmong against the end of the world, called "The End of the World is off."
Would a member of the YouTube audience already like to attend these beneficent concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if everything comes and the end of the world doesn't come.
He's gonna get all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The Gimna will also sound live on Czech television.
The words of this song were written and played the role of Jesus in Tomash Ganak's clique, who is also involved in the execution of Hindl X....
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other Czech cultural staff because we have many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively trying to integrate them into these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, they're interested.
What's the product of a concert versus the end of the world?
So, for the sixth year, we've been working with Tap's civil association at the Yedlica Institute.
Teachers regularly attend and engage in fun and interesting activities with students at the Schools of the Yedlik Institute.
The students themselves have no means of going to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of a project to build the Edlik Institute in the future, we will have a separate building in which we will move with the project.
Several music groups and performers will attend each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratospresse with Dan Barta, The Tap Tapa, Maryan Bangui and Irji Suhi.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar “grave events” in the future?
We're going to be speaking for the first time in May at the Spring Spring Festival, and here, of course, we're preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago personally if we were in the United States.
You have serious plans about the borders, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tapp Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs to travel to the luggage compartment, plus to all the cargo and boxes with tools.
Nevertheless, as long as the Czech airlines and British British British Airways were doing it without problems, they were always prepared for us, and I was surprised at how many times I was.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, it went without problems.
Through overseas visits, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you faced so far?
Since Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed that we are still at the basic level in the east.
There are still many barriers in Moscow compared to Prague, and in the wild, man’s own movement in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city is still in the wild.
Also, it's not like things like things like walking down the road to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, social organizations have already emerged that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we have to catch up with the front countries all the time?
There's a lot of things that are far behind us.
But it is important to make clear that improvement and improvement always depend on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it's quite normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own on the streets, to go to the toilet, to a museum, anywhere...
It's not very common because a lot of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and that's where we're ahead of them with The Tap Taps!
Respect for the public or for freedom of mind is one thing, but at a time when we get famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then we're going to start changing.
As long as it's a single case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, that in 1998 you were forced to organize it?
I went to the Yedlika Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing the same game on the saxophone myself, I've organized an interesting music game with my colleague.
And over time, as our leader Lade Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
It's only in recent years that the population has arrived, or am I confused?
That's true, we've been helped by the fact that we've started joining the famous singers and working actively on the propaganda team.
We have concluded that work that no one can evaluate is essentially nonexistent.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was there a goal in front of you to make The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something unexplored.
The Shaw Business is full of things that imitate one another.
That makes sense, it's all taken up with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I'm going to dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us is, of course, a pity, a natural one...
But that pity is far better because people with disabilities are not the ones who are suffering and all the abandoned persons that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Have you succeeded in being a strict leader, as many consider you?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be in many things in a messy and disciplined way.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to practice, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
At present, the Tap Tap is a group of twenty people.
How many were in early 1998?
There's only one Lade Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent it.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the anticipated end of the world, Thursday, 20.12, 2100.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba, Brno at Fléda and Ostrov, in the centre of Plynojem, with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telemotor at the time of performing the song of The Tap Tap, "The World End is off."
The aim of the project is to raise 25 million kroner funds for the purchase of multi-functional non-retroviral equipment for the STUDEO Education Centre at the Yedlica Institute in Prague.
You can buy 400 crowns for kids under the age of 12 free to buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaket.
Poland and space.
Last week, the Ministerial Meeting of the European Space Agency of Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former East bloc countries (after Czechia, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and took an active part in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were flying into space, but this was not always a matter of understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Sternfeld, which was presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from its innovative work, “Intracting to Space. ”
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) were left to an indifferent audience, and after several years Sternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Haddowski alone had an interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and André Luis Hirsch's award for "Making Space".
Dr. Jan Haddsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist for astronomy and cosmonauts.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these subjects.
The Gadomsky became a prominent cosmonautist of the world, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the importers on the other side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway cut was built in Poland, equipped with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the draft.
It is not clear whether a rocket has to be used for the breakup or for braking.
Information about this shit is only available from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has started thinking about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjitsk.
The remaining materials show that the studies reached the practical test stage.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, a specialized press came up with the idea of a photo-electronic fighter rocket proposed by the Rygosinski engineer, and next year the work of the "Trpeda Air Missile and the Bomb Airball Missile" by the author Lelia-Kevlocsk.
Both projects were designed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war itself, all missile projects were carried out by the Provisional Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczavey Komitt Doradczo-Nakowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Thorázsystico Astronautyczne).
The first public is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Pöblama, which publishes four extensive articles on astronauts.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed organizing a society that would engage in space technology.
At the time, artificial satellite projects had already been acquired, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PAA) has tried to join the international Federation of Astronauticals (founded in 1951) and has become an active member of the staff.
In the following year, the first PPA Chairman, Kazigi Zrankevic (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful RM meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out a scientific study.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first was launched on 10 October 1958.
A rocket capable of crossing a distance of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved RM-1A version was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 rocket tests were carried out in the Bladov Desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out this scientific work, the RM-34 missile could have gone over 14.5 km and its mission was to monitor the high wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed to be a two-tier length, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which varied in size in the cells for scientific equipment.
The Methere-1A rocket had an space of 0.4 litres, meteor-1B 0.34 litres and meteor-1C 0.62l.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a start-up weight of 380 kg, was able to produce 10 kg of useful cargo at about 60 km high.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor3 versions were then built.
Reference is also made to Poland's accession to COSPAR (the Space Research Committee) in 1960 and to the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashewski became the second intercosmonaut since Vladimir Remek.
Abolishing the public works law is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decision caused a lively debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with undecided financial speculation.
A significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) results in price pressures.
These concepts need to be understood when the producer, through delivery of the cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by making the value of a competitor appear to be in order to obtain much of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad or to buy cheaply abroad or to disappear, thereby increasing unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including that of the unemployed, it is increasing the inevitable social costs of the State.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business leaders to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they have suffered in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unsolicited private capital techniques create a situation at the economic level of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with one another to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own populations arbitrariness to private capital despite social declines.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in existing legislation.
The goal is to make their people submit economically to the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a means of curtailing workers ' rights in labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty, while the difference between the poor and the rich, is increasing.
For several years, the FWG has had a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases where workers are paid such wages that the State must pay for their minimum subsistence.
Such a scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional workers in Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the EU ' s southern States undoubtedly result in the same situation in which people under pressure from devastating social decline have to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or live on a poor salary at the expense of society, in the hope that private investment will ever arrive in the country.
But ask him where he will come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African, still works for the share of European wages.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
The liberal theory and the media before tones claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists in insisting that the State should not be the agents of interference in the economy.
The question should be further answered as to whether private capital, which is now virtually the manager of politics and the most important State, does not exist for its own selfish purposes.
A clear answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and worldwide lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the FWG, the situation is that government ministries, owing to funding constraints, are entrusted with the drafting of drafts to private legal firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by Bundestag.
All power is derived, not from the people, as stated in the Western Constitution, but from the economic and financial groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly becoming a situation, as described by Appian in the work of "Criss of the Roman Empire in Caesar and Pompeii": "The State has long been decomposeed and the agencies have been violent.
Scourges, illegal obtaining of grace by means of stones and swords.
The takeover and corruption were flourishing without any ban, and the people went to the election with a pre-sold voice"... the people of the world didn't speak to the post of ruler at all, after all, the State for eight months was left without a conservatory. "The fact was that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-reservation and the need to choose an energetic human being." Appian thought that it would be Pompey, but he became Caesar, who eventually changed democracy into self-responsion.
As in ancient times, society prevails over its own reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the impenetrable decline of the elite without any effort to undertake deeper reforms.
Therefore, the cause of fascist and communist regimes must be found in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next tour is expected.
Above all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision or, at least, not a permanent decision.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s pre-eminence to the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and reduce the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The chaos laboratory.
"The violence won't go out, and it can never go out" -- Sting, the song "The Good," where the main poem of the refreens is, "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be" -- the dying Gotel Schnaper, Meer Amchel's wife, Rotschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some speak out of Israel ' s position that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by reasoning on this racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who, in these recurring killing waves, is a criminal, and who's the victim, after all, of today's Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, was born at the moment of the current political situation and was not seen as a result of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look beyond the curtain, to see who has been the first to serve for 95 years of tension (due to the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East land.
Some of my discussions have been backed by historical facts, some of which have been withdrawn on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of humanity is, first and foremost, a history of power struggles.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
Which is not so clear whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards their intended goals.
We must allow ourselves to live at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it could not have taken place in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as the head of the rod (I don't know if anyone is above them, but it's not excluded) is Rotschild.
A lot of people don't write about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they had bought in the 1990s, 19th century, to stop their rumours, link their names to criminal actions in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadow, and who have always led to the strengthening of their power, the growth of wealth, or both.
They have large stocks of shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks they do not have their share, they wage or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only seven countries, five countries after the invasion of Iraq, only four of them remained, but at the same time the Russian Government has taken the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain his status as a central bank for the Rotschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (know - government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began printing his own money and wanted to cancel FED (the federal reserve system) was killed in 1963, and the deputate of Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to apply to the FED for the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the design of the three world wars created by the great masses of 33 Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchic States in Europe, and the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 billion people (that would be sufficient for their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything other than a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of richest families headed by Rotschilds works is a crisis and a subsequent offer of solutions (orer a·cho - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and have always led to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of FED, which should have prevented a recurrence of the crisis they had caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the First World War through the killing of the Habsburg successor to Ferdinand of Sarajevo, they destroyed the Royal Russia by beginning a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended in a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer need for war to destroy royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Wengri, was disbanded.
In order to facilitate the spread of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing on Germany a huge military reparation, rather than a prerequisite for the radicalization of depleted masses, then only to throw the Germans away with a strong, face-to-face, and offering simple decisions by the Chief, further the establishment of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the role of a fifth column in fuelling the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds provoked the origin of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judah with Jerusalem as its capital (restoration to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, and first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chain in which he was initially held by the bankers, or what he did, had been planned, in any case, for the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps had created prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany ' s military retribution on World War II, the State of Israel was declared to create the edge of the war of the Third War.
If international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, like the Second World War, will be the victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to say the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only at the domestic level but also at the international level (only a sharp division of people against supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the insults in the endless chain of violence have all begun with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers have encouraged people to vote in elections of their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascist, loyal international bankers who are making every effort to wage war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will be threatened by a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of all world oil reserves (the fair corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994 is now saying, "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a bitter financial aristocratic, comfortable.
A world where every person born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a creature under complete control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave men to have on their right hand or on their forehead glue, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom of knowing that everyone with discernment can calculate the number of animals.
For it is the name of man, and this number is six hundred sixty-six.
The movie "Argo": When it's worse than anything, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrators captured the United States Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the destroyed chess, Mohammed Rezi Pehlevi, who had been in the United States after the U.S. revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, no positive outcome was expected - it could not afford to throw a chess overboard, because it could at the root undermine the credibility of allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocracy, was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The foreign prisoners were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations under the mediation of the Algerian Government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranism.
The defeat in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat at the 1980s presidential election, which culminated in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film by Actor Ben Afflect, "Argo", describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America a little victory.
Shortly before the Embassy was occupied, six workers were fled.
After complex periepts, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to remove them from Iran, with an extraordinary cover legend that led to the removal of Canadian passports as members of a survey group that had been found in the country to survey the science and fiction epipeii.
Genital balance
Tony Mendez's Eevacuation expert plan required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, a film was written in specialized magazines, a press conference, and a creative manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez memoirs.
Afflect's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political triller, the so-called fem-quinoopus, the story of a good conundrum, the arena, can be an example of a series of movies about Ochhen's friends.
The film’s moods are constantly changing - on the one hand, well-documented scenes from Tehran (significant historical photographs of events are shown in the tigers and how the same situations have been demonstrated in the film - there are no major differences in this.)
On the other hand, the relief of the Holocaust's flexions, which overlap with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in costumes are talking about the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleka has made a remarkable progression in his career.
The laughing actor became a respected director, and his game was no longer the target of ridicule.
Argo's third full-time film after a dark detective called Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye (2007) and Gorod Triller (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleka film, which is not filmed in the home city of the film - office director - boston.
The sense of the atmosphere is also true of the qualities that have risen up earlier films of the film director over the Hollywood Holly Standard.
And Affle is showing it at Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events -- the opening scenes of the Embassy's fall are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and uncertainty that arise when history suddenly changes.
Affle and his colleagues have a similar effect in the scenarios of fiction (driver headquarters in the Tegran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the confession did not imply a multitude of film-rich scenes.
He's quite successful in working with this little one, sometimes he's thinking about something -- there's not that elegant, that's where the phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the run-up of the airstrip looks pretty crazy.
The lack of Argo is a diversity that is linked to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very careful, but their characters would deserve more space, and they would not be the only ones in the film.
Afflect's image lacks some dramatism, which is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, evaluating the structure and the retro line, which restores the 300s.
But it's hard to take.
This, however, is sufficient to remind one, still in the known sense of living history, and to show how far superior it is to the imaginations of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services.
Airstrips, bananas and circuses
The portal www.bankovniply.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to hold a competition for “the most absurd order or project in the EU workshops”.
“We have been able to do so by the latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” stated the “Pruity” coordinator of the questionnaire, Patrick Nager.
Among the above-mentioned obscenities is the recent decision of the European Court to merge the rates of insurance for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"The other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013” said Nager.
The EU ' s controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocompensants to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees simply because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the chicken cell, which has resulted in a significant travel of eggs this year.
Criticism has also been subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term “bubric oil” or the removal of classical light bulbs.
Quality bananas shall be 14 cm long.
The Pan-European vehicle often makes a decision under pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions are usually protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic is now even at risk of a veto defending the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are that, for example, the high quality bananas in Europe were supposed to reach a length of 14 cm without the courage to display “atomic curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission justified only harmonizing existing fragmented national regulations that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has also mitigated the standards for fruits and vegetables, pointing out that existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
A candidate for a win-win survey may also be the EU Regulation last year, according to which the selling balloons must necessarily be warned that children under the age of eight cannot wear them without the care of adults.
The EU has asked for studies in the United States that air balloons at play are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction is now applicable to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from going to the fairway.
Creating funny ideas is also at home
Abstinent is also the rule concerning European officials themselves: everyone who has a formal office in the EU cannot, given the sensitive nature of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but must instead say “BUM” (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípopacty.com, in collaboration with liberal economists 'Principle of Non-interference', proposed a vote in addition to a few of the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum level of food stocks that can be found in the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Since then, Czechia has exceeded, for example, the established amounts of canned mushrooms, for which a large fine was imposed on it.
The questionnaire organizers also wondered about the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of grants for applications for grants.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask for compensation from the European Union,” stated the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas (PPP), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that there had been a high harvest of grain in the country and, as a result of so-called interventional procurement, the State had a full supply of supplies that had to be removed.
Because Czechia is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palau, was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender to purchase grain from landlocked countries.
Grant grants were offered to the village by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemtz (US-DEU), in particular, to apply for grants from Brussels.
EU: Intelligent Orders are an exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective operation and development of the European Union, are seen by many experts as meriting recognition rather than recognition.
The major problem, according to experts, was the drawing of EU grants on projects that did not even have an indication of something similar to the deepening of European integration, but that had been achieved by Member States in budget discussions.
The Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Germans and Austrians had retained the name "Olomots" after six years of fighting, "The Tusem of the Sea", whose traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tumac."
The rum may only be called tundlinic products, not sugar cellulose.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-known “pheta” and “gorgnzene”, the Marcipan of German Lubek, or the steam branch, has already appeared, for example, Carlowar dryers, the Hungarian and the Tribonian Carp and the Jewish hammel.
Also, the EU’s trade mark may be proud of the greenhouse baking tube and the burning tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come into the head to fight for the presidency?
I don't think of being a senator or president myself.
If everything was in our country without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can't see how in the last 20 years, the country has been developing, like thieves, raising people's tax and pension age.
I didn't want to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution to that.
And since I am forty years old, and I am an independent person who is not part of any party, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the post of senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you then turn to the people who have chosen you?
I kept saying that I would be involved in the presidential castle, depending on the results of the Senate election.
I later explained that if I were to be chosen as senator, I would run for presidents.
My goal is not a post, a post is a tool that allows me to carry out my views.
So I need the greatest influence and the greatest powers.
But the difficulty is, not only is it that we, like a nation rushing in a bar or a TV, are ready to melt anyone who tries to change.
In addition to this are the media that resonate people and that confuse freedom of speech with freeness of speech.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroubek.
Let's go to your point of view.
The fight for the presidential castle, you started with ideas about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back-to-back property declarations above 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You have no such powers as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for a tour to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately make obstacles, and that deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
It's my advantage that I don't have a party snooping in half, without looking at the dogma, I can take from each party what's best for my country and apply it.
Do you think you're more right-wing or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm being taken to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not that someone is right, but someone left, I want to put people together.
I will always support any good decision of society whether it will be offered by the HRC or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're popular.
But do you prove that to be what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
You might call it a lot, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by eminent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll have only slogans.
You can't stay in politics with this.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to attain the responsibilities of crime and property?
I don't have another opportunity.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side so that we can make our way.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to regularize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell you why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality that reflects abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, it was a matter of public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm a lover, not a genius, I didn't know.
I try to seek allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and for my programme I'm going to try to get the support of the majority.
I've been trying to move myself, and if that's not possible, I'll end in six years and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Ocampour is supposed to save Czecha.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything, so I went around a number of well-known people asking me to run to the Senate.
I went to Radma Janchur, and he refused for a lot of work.
I also supported the leading investigation by a journalist, Jan Lorentsov, who exposed fraud with light oil products.
I've put forward my candidature because people are really unsatisfied, but now I feel I'm on weight.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of the people who went through the post-graduate process were elected.
We're independent in the Senate only two.
People chose the Senate to make changes hard to do.
Despite that, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the purity of every potential opponent's past, and I don't have money for it.
There's no money in the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own business dealing with it?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I've got a section in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, an Ast-Martin 3.5 million, and Superb code of a million, well, and a few more million dollars per account.
By the time I got to Aston Martin, because it was my little dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, there was a galant with women, while fighting against subsoil and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martina, own 60 million assets, and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that my programme is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will actually cover my senator's salary.
But I wouldn't be able to live on this money, for example, if I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 dollars a month.
If only I wanted to earn money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing entrepreneurship so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to cut it down?
But that doesn't depend on the wages.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the director of the tourist agency in spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a madman who's going to keep the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How many, as a business, have you used to getting used to it on a monthly basis?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, and I'll get further.
And if I were to become president, I'd end my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's "The Right" newspaper.
MVRDV architects have proved that these adventures are not just imaginations - in the case of Spikeniss and his recently built Prince's Mount - 2 photos
"I think it's a fun building, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verheim, on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby big enterprise, says, "No, it's a pretty building."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No one is willing to go to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spikeniss, a small - sighted bedroom under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 8,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this sad circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven elaborate bridges, which are shown on euro bank notes, in the form of painted miniabeton mines.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And the city's fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to have statistics: building a library here!
Maas's company at the MVrDV Company Company Company, a master of bold columnized diagrams and author of hard-core, sometimes even cynic constructions, had to do with his usual intransigence and appeared at a competitive audit in 2003 with five books under a mouse and a smile on his face.
As long as members of the jury looked up and shook their shoulders, the hard Maas composed his original gift of the pyramid in size, and completed the talk in defense of his draft by saying, "Affected citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal, "Long Mountain" in Speykenisse, what's called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a rehabilitation project, which also includes underground garages, supermarkets, postage and several home and taunhouse houses adjacent to them, and a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the “Long Mountain” was awarded the second award of the 2012 “Best Library of the Netherlands”.
The project also participates in the 2012 National Dutch Wood Building Competition.
Thus, the lush suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything other than the post-modern walking area and the amazingly stealthic graft, whose white facades suggest the idea of milk production, have become richer in one modern architecture.
But most important of all, Spikenis was the first public cultural building in this town's history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that the book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain array, because real actors of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The hidden room on all sides is light and easily visible, the fields of a preconceived brick and elegant street lamps create a sense of public urban space.
The city environment is restored perfectly.
The eyes are uneasily looking for benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The bookstores are usually along the front of the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually indescribable and useless," says Vini Maas.
We set up a classic head-on-side configuration and pulled out the area for reading from inside.
The inside of the book mountain is cleverly used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the center.
In particular are the black bookshelfs, which serve as a branch of the wall, the parapets, and the doves.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers lose their guesses, what kind of stuff it is.
“We have tried to work with secondary materials” explains Jop Trauborst, Project leader of the Spikeniss community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once in a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, artificial fibre material has been used in heats and fields in the Netherlands as a substitute for the root.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The tone textile serves one or two seasons and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in such volumes, was suppressed in a panel of four inches [4 cm] thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called "KLTP" turns into a dark, homogeneous, plumbing material, a bit like a new car and a little sneaker.
The top is 105 degrees.
Anyone who overcomes the path nearly 500 meters [500 m] will be rewarded with a literary coffee not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by Dutch steppes and tree figs in the hills.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the proper humidity on the literary mountain.
New soul cost
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Snowy Mountain is under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun falls only for a little while.
The broad, glue - wood farms perpendicular to the glass facade provide shades and most of the sun’s rays.
It's a very nice room.
The rest of the protection is provided with fully automatic steering curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned earlier by the IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verheim was also here.
And also a teacher in traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchanberg "the Spikenise soul that was long missing."
The reason is that a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to contribute one book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to take up empty spaces on the shelf not yet full of the library, and at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are filled with trust.
"It's nothing worse than a semi-publish library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident is now connected in some way to this new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves for ornament.
So the MVRDV has been able to solve a royal task called the creation of identity in a professional jargon.
Spikenis wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for creating identity.
S/C: “The Germans have a more important role to play”.
Germany abstained in the voting on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, doing so, is balancing Berlin on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: Early in the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it's an American position, either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the voting on the establishment of the no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO had implemented the proposal.
It was difficult for Germany to make a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The point is that she's in the process of transforming her foreign policy, which is going from a policy that, as the U.S. put it, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent single policy among Europeans.
The Germans are thus back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they're just getting their part, they're on their way to a more normal foreign policy.
Foreign policy pursued by France or Great Britain.
What does German foreign policy specifically mean?
It is a willingness to take on a position independent of the US or European partners in their national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests were significantly different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Had those economic interests affected the position of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets for marketing in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
She therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to this, it's not entirely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany affected its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure there's an understanding of German position in Europe and even in the United States.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even acquire some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it is to be considered in its interest.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly expressed.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European States?
Because of the American domestic policy, such differences always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government is deeply aware of the European position.
But, in view of the local political situation, the Government is certainly not open to such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as ever.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all happy with Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the European Union’s most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, Germans would have been a little easier if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now that is not the case.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
Clearly, it is not easy for Germany, at least because of relations with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, will it not take on a truly central role?
Or is Germany still a challenge?
Germany has not yet been used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, has always had a significant role to play.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes on an important role, there is a wide variety of antiherman feelings.
Germans don't just handle it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, which is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakened, but at this point the EU is not filling that vacuum, but who is still?
Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant or exhilarating to you, that's life!

China's trademark security: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known trade mark, Pol Rolp Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms it's named after.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file file a claim.
Then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloh, lawyer for Taylor Wesing, an attorney specializing in violations of rights to trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk, this kind of new case appears every week.
Immunizers need to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So it's from Guccsi that we get to Lu-Gucci, and instead of Parda, we can register Brada-Kny.
German enterprises, such as Puma's sports producers, are legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens a folder with registration records in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, an artificial name also using the name of the fashion house Ermengildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Pattloh's cases are not the same, and on instructions from his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises should be officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it a "ban pollai", a brand of passenger.
That word's associated with "ban docuan."
So they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept blame
"It harms business, it has to be fought," I'm sure Pattloch.
"The trade stamp is blurred, the unique situation is lost, the image is suffering very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to obtain the removal of questionable trade-marks in the Register of Trade Marks, and it is expensive.
The process may last up to nine years, with unclear results.
Pattloch describes cases in which the court rejected claims because after a long time, the contested title became “market realities”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he'll even have to pay the plagiar, because he damaged his trade sign in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle rule here.
There are also famous works on graphic elements.
In 2009, Damler lost his legal dispute with the construction engineer Suny, a company that had recently acquired the concrete-based company Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use an embryo that looks like a Mercedes star.
Gaely, the purchase of Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, and Gaely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products, Lacoste, lost simulations from Hong Kong and Singapore in China, with a famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 owing to the shortage of staff and equipment.
Last year, however, there was a “restoration from an emergency in the work process to normal”.
Thus, the number of outstanding objections had decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still pending proceedings in the department.
Dealing With It Costly
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTO received over 1.4 million claims for the protection of trademarks, almost one third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has been in charge of the list of new registers for the tenth consecutive time worldwide, reports to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trade signs, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of Euro280 or Euro160.
It is worth many times more than that, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the ending has been fighting against the Chinese plagiar.
The Germans have been able to ensure that their counterfeit car parts have been illegally manufactured.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was a personal omission, as names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, president of the government of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Office rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won both of its next institutions, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
It's gotta be like this.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Procession is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerve."
Internal costs are hardly suitable for accounting, the firm's archives had to look at even acts of centuries old to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unproductively offered to the opposite side a “more than six-digit Euro” settlement.
"It's so clear how expensive it is to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to flee to Europe.
This is the case if the simulators register unprotected trade marks there.
For example, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
Concrine had long stopped production in those areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be like this," says Wentzler.
Both he and counsel for Pattloch recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, but rather on foreigners “any way to protect, register also in China”, says Wentzler.
Otherwise it might cost much more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trade mark drama, he will have to pay to the other side the licence fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we'll get out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Hurry, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the chorus of Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
History of relations that have gone beyond 8,733 kilometres.
At first, we have a peak: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's hands pick up a taxi on the parking floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the singers’ voices grow slowly - the alt, the bass, the tenor, and the soprano - and they wear, and they bewitched, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and tangible gestures.
Monday evening, a new song is being rehearsed at the Music School of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a man’s genetics to a palace, attended the practice.
Om Obani is not an easy thing, but every voice of the choir has its text, in a completely foreign language: the Zulu language, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self - Assistance
The United Nations AIDS programmes estimated that there are approximately 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 per cent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitendi village, the company Voices for Africa has found superintendents in Germany.
70 of them attend school for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the government.
It guarantees to the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch in Gogo Centre.
The Imbongi in the Zulu language means the scribe or the praiser.
They don't say in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the chorus has studied songs in this soft language, and from time to time has even brought them back to where they first appeared, in southern Africa.
After all, the village of Esiteng, which depends on the vote of the German chorus, is located some 873 miles [8733 km] of summer from Heidelberg in the north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty per cent infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, and many children live among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HM virus.
In Esiten, the overall illness of Swaziland is reflected: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF data in the world.
The cut-off of the extreme flesh in men, which has proved to reduce the risk of half of infection, has not been accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population is infected with immunodeficiency virus, and the death rate in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Chord opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before, he had seen a lot of children in the streets who lacked parental care not only but also just food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private undertaking by individual participants to send a child to school within a few euros a year and allow him to receive hot food once a day.
A year later, however, a group called Voices for Africa was formed, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjana.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Cyphilis, chlamidosis, and tryps (Northernia) are assigned to bacterial PPIs.
HIV, human papilla virus, genetic herpes and hepatitis are frequent HIV/AIDS.
The lubric acid and scavenger are among the parasitic PPIs.
What are the main wounded groups?
Cyphilis and gonorrhea are mainly observed by men who have sex with men.
The Robert Coha Institute estimates that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany result from male sexual relations.
Heterosexual adults are often exposed to sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamidian infections, trichomoniasis, candidos (grobs), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are attributed to this group.
Clamid infections are more common among young people than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections strike young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have many young people with human papilloma virus.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
According to Robert Coha Institute, the incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are some symptoms of a venereal disease?
Ideals in the field of genitals, urea complaints, release, pain at the bottom of the stomach, and bubbles or lubrication may arise in infectious diseases.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Reservatives can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
Some sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through contact infection and in close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular examination, especially in the case of the frequent replacement of sexual partners.
In early diagnostics, most of the PPIs can be cured and avoid remote effects.
The chiefs, the donations, and not least the honors for the curry's performance throughout Germany are able to gather something.
"All of this we've sent to Esitgeni about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lanenrtz, president of the association.
In Germany, German money is managed by Tsiod Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares for orphans, such as one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, it's the back of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, given them shelter over their heads, and made sure that their children show up on lessons on time every day.
Those who have no families left come to the shelter for Hanyil, a single woman who is paid for by association, as do two cooks that each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two smokers, and together with the United States Health Organization, PSI conducted HIV testing for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so apparent throughout the country prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 Women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lenenrtz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of exclusivity.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of CI virus in past years.
But it also lies on the stray workers who are spreading the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annette Lanenrtz, "but they're barely used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To give some support to cultural exchanges, the Ibmóni choir travels every two to three years in southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many in the southern part of the black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing in black, not only brings good moods and joy, but even tears in the eyes of the harsh bordermen.
Visits are always carried out in Esitjana, where singers visit children who are in the air.
Despite the difficulty of finding a small village on the map, it is more well known in the Etzulveni Valley.
"Go to Esitani, there's light," people say.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when crowding singers return to the tutoring room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here as well.
NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messinger Sun found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercure.
Leaf cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA’s space agency has proved ice on the planet Mercure.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the Science Special Journal.
The Messinger Sun has found evidence that the region of the world is constantly under the shadow of ice.
Its thickness shall be less than three inches [30 cm], possibly up to 20 metres.
It is believed that water comes from comets or possibly asteroids encountered by Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, says science chief Sean Solomon of the probe.
The temperature at Mercure may be 426 degrees Fahrenheit [426 ° C.].
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life came to other places in the solar system.
The Earth’s inhabitants are exposed to probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenicus, which will explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth — small glasses in endless places.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Cartel planet Cererere.
Like Pluton, who calls on the Sun for Neptune, Cerrera, according to the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spectre telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue, the more difficult it is to identify different “new-born” stars in the star circle.
This region of starry - scientists call it “W5” - opened by the Space Telescope at the Kassiopea constellation, some 6,500 light-years away.
This overheating heat of a dying star photographed NASA's "Spiter."
The ring looks like a ring of material that the star threw in the process of dying.
The giant trifid nebula, which is some 4,500 light years away from the Earth, produces new stars from the gas and dust.
NASA telescope "Spitzer" took this picture of the galactic family unit.
You can see the off-site of Pleiades, also called the “Seven Sisters,” by night an unarmed eye.
Of course, the telescope is a better color.
As the red eye softens the observer's nebula of the velica in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away from the Waterfield constellation.
This nebula is called "North America."
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides a unique color transfer.
This new star has been able to photograph only with infrared telescope sensors called "Spiter".
Saturn and his ring: How they came up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's Saturn Moons, which just disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Vodover galaxy
Depending on the color transmittal, the images of the spiral galaxies are transformed into actual works of art.
The photograph produced by the European South Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the solstice for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trigedus, since dark strips of dust divide into three parts of the split heart into a star’s collage.
In the constellation Zmeeneska, astronomers photographed a space collision for 400 million light-years away from the Earth of two luminating galaxies and inevitably face each other.
This is the birth of the Habble telescope in a sporian galaxy called M83.
Someone who doesn't like the technical cuts might call it the "South Creek College."
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The 1500 light-year fog consists of particles of dust that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the normal household dust.
This image was drawn from the optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 took a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the great spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This stardy nebula has the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
Stars are constantly creating an off-site chariot.
It's a star cloud connected to the Rosenka Nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
There's no dust in this bright luminating galaxy with a little black hole yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was largely filled with hydrogen.
Our views in the universe are critical telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem, even before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have become more and more powerful, and space available to them has become deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, depicted here, was about five metres in diameter.
There's "The Big Binocular Telescope" in Arizona, U.S.A..
It allows space to be viewed by two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 m.
"Gran Telesopio Canarias" has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 metres.
The "The Big South African Telescope" screen in South Africa is segmented to lower costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches approximately 11 metres in diameter.
Lack of poor design: the telescope is rigidly attached to a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
Hobbie-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its specificity: a high luminosity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of mirrors - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Aresíbo (Puerto Rico) researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the project "Eternal Mind Search" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computational power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes
It's the Big Telescope. It's completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be seen in the escape pipe.
It is also planned to install a European "Sea of the Large Telescope" at the Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror must drop at a length of 42 meters, with almost 1,000 mirrors to be drawn up.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered to be the largest telescope in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 meters in diameter.
The Ceck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of the Suba and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, Mauna Kea should have a new giant telescope, with a mirror of 30 metres in diameter.
Here, they can be liked for illustrations.
However, the most important species from space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been presenting pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 satellite candidates had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photograph records the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webba Space Telescope (JWST) will be deployed to space no sooner than 2018 on board the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of an infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to find a Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messinger moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Generous measurements for decades pointed out that Mercuria has ice.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first one that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident of it.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach their literacy age.
There's even a long-lived museum here.
Finding a difference in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach their literacy age.
There's even a long-lived museum here.
Finding a difference in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be still relatively young.
You can call it wild and romantic.
The microbus thunders over the vast road past the ever - grown thick forests of the hills, stormy speakers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything's so green and bright that you can think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few kilometres from here.
Here they live, one of the people of the Caucasus known for a little, except that they speak beautifully of the farce and the Azerbaijanis and are long - lived.
The end point is Lerick.
A small town is engrossed in the harsh architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
The tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours to get 323 kilometers because the road has only one lane.
The liberal wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea's oil is here in the province until it's reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something in Lerica that is of interest to tourists.
"In May, Baku was famous for the European song festival, and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest," Fatulaev said.
She's the director of the Long-Ten Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There are about eight dozen tablets of those places that are more than 100 years old, and Fatulaev points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
When he was 136 years old, he had another baby.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shiranlei Müslumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
However, no birth certificate.
Given the fact that the older person whose age was documented had reached 122 years of age, the age of Müsljana was extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, who allegedly had a daughter at 136 years of age.
So did Müslum’s tea add a couple decades to its age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rosoke, heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
“In some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, an amazing number of elderly people also find themselves in Sardinia,” says Shotz,“and so many very old people also live in Sardinia”.
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific confirmation of age was not possible, since there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of toasty oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lericka area often reach Bible age.
Twenty people are now living here over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many people here in the south?
A Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this to the special genes of the ta hearsay.
The director of the Fathulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
The ta hearers love meat, bread, and most of the milk products, many of them drink on a bunch of hot butter every day; however, it is unlikely that such high - calorie diets can be healthy on a nutritional basis.
Or is it in the original way of life that preserves youth?
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that doesn't get tired.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzai, who has long had grandchildren.
There are also two young men running around.
In the kitchen, visitors prepare tea, which is served in the typical powdered glass of the Armada.
Myrazava has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, and under her headt she lays a long black-rust bone that her son proudly opens before us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell and kept their color.
"And I've never used champagne," says Mirzav.
The monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what had grown in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in the store in my entire life.
She then tells of her husband, who was serving in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it's better when Haydar Aliev's "love father" got in the helm.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and his son, Ilham, was adopted by the riots of power.
However, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani old people.
230 nuns (equivalent to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva is paid monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount for which a good living can be achieved.
And perhaps a long-standing son of Mirzawev also had the right, "The stars of our culture enjoy profound respect."
They live in a large family, loved ones, surrounded by care and happiness.
The reason to stay alive is as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution
The revolution came back to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division of the country.
The future Shariah-based constitution met with a strong opposition.
The Egyptian president did not buy a paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to the god," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but primarily to Christian cops, liberals, educated Muslims, and unreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, who are still hopelessly divided into a lost opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious State on the Nile against the mercy of a powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi, who had almost apologized, said that he had temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and had expanded his competence “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree at the American University of South California is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be dragged into the night of a 15-hour leap, with obstacles to Islamistism, a constitutional gathering of 100 participants, which is partly a cause of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists would use vague language and the legal luffus that arose in connection with it for a more rigorous interpretation of the Shariah.
At least one new article refers to this: in all Sharia cases, a council of the University of Al-Achar, an important Islamic institution of the country that enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be appointed.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy is in charge of the law, which would in fact have been the result of the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much was the subject of interpretation
Another issue: the jurisdiction of civilians in the military court should be maintained.
These courts, during the Mubarak period, served to suppress the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention following the overthrow of the dictator.
Also, as the draft states, the State must protect the “true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values”.
Legally speaking, it is so vague that government agencies will be able to control even the contents of the film and literature.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article sets out the direct equality of men and women.
Yet another forbids the wronging of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what such an insult and how it must be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that “disgusting of persons” is prohibited.
Is there enough cartoons on the president or a joke about the lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Murcy proposed for signature, would, he said, “very soon” be submitted to Egypt's referendums.
"Revolution has come back."
For several weeks, opposition has been formed against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unity of Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third seat in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft Constitution was “in the landfill of history”.
Through the Twitter short news service, he accused Mursi's supporters of wishing to lead a “torture against democracy”.
"If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and throw him down," said oppositioner Yasser Said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been extinguished”, quoted Egyptian media as referring to Khaled Ali’s opposition policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"Coran is our constitution."
A well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but out of caution, not in the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile to the University of Cairo.
A large number of women were present under the patronages and Salafites who shouted: “The people require the application of God’s law”.
They asked Murcia to "clean the country" and said, "Coran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began had provoked the state of almost a civil war.
The followers of Mursie apparently didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft constitution had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to give the people a solution to the electoral regime in which the country must move.
Most of the Islamists' project is considered to have been settled.
"The concept of human rights is not mentioned once."
Hafiz Abu Saeda in a rage from this forceful constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) protected the Muslim Bratiev when they were in prison or brought before a court in Mubarak.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never in the new constitution, and he regrets the conversation with Welt am Sonntag.
The increasing influence of Murcia on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“The President, instead of strengthening the civilian State, has de facto cancelled it”, regrets Saeda.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saida feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggles of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
Payable payments may be due.
The demon in the Tachir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian cancer: the dumbest smelling fish in the world?
In Norway, five million people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success is somehow related to local passion for one extremely caught fish?
Take a few re-seals of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have a rebuffing smell of cancer, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but in the air, there's an unquenchable characteristic smell.
Cancer is a trout with salt and blizzards in water until the year, depending on what kind of soul it is to be achieved.
As the bags roll and chill, the Norwegian crowd gather at the Fagerne festival dedicated to this very thing, say, an exciting dish.
"He eats cheese, and has a bag of aquavit, a local soft water," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in his profession and co-operated by the "cancer general" who leads the festival.
People around us eat small amounts of fish cut into pieces and pollinate it with small amounts of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquats more than cancer," says Haward.
It's a drink that can smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad -- it's just a little different from the piece of dry land that you took a long time with you on the bus.
Cancer is a Norwegian product from quite different times, a time of poverty, when fish were sealed in hermetically closed barrels of salt water before refrigerators appeared in the fall.
Then, in a deep winter, when the fish had already been killed, it had been recovered, and had been consumed by alcohol and consumed.
At last generation's memory, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and immigrate, mainly in the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent of whom are immigrants, who take up jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (a long-standing rival and not so long ago and a much more distant neighbour) have come to work here in large numbers.
The cancer is seen as an important symbol, an irreprehensible, even somewhat vicious, element of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it would cost you nine pounds (14 United States) of beer or sandwiches.
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most people in the country seem to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Brevik, racist and right-hand extremist, last year of killing and killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist is referred to as “to be heard on 22 July”.
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been capable of such atrocities and killings.
Today ' s well-being, Norway has been driven by the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the beginning of the seventieths.
"But oil is not the only cause of our prosperity," says Anna, our waitresser, who's described in a variety of manners with a worn-out Crimean, a woman with long, bright hair, and remarkably blue eyes, the transformation of the Norwegian well-being.
We are the people, as you call it, the people of understanding.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English.
We don't like to show, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of its revenues are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all had been cut off by money they did not have, Norway has carefully calculated all costs.
"As long as you can ride in the icy winter and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, a cancer with me.
There's a hamburger with a salmon meat that's definitely esoteric, delicious scab meat.
But we're still looking for more fish with unforgetable smell.
At my hotel, a special dinner is held on cancer, during which visitors vote to determine the best or possibly most aromatic fish.
There's a live telepher, which shows the lead in a circa-bub, surrounded by cervix plates.
It's like a song contest called "Eurasia."
So, Thor-jurgen, what's your estimate of the best fish you have there in your mountains?
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the ceiling, maybe taking over the Aquavit.
Or maybe just through the smell of that fish.
Mexico's President, Enrique Penya Nyeto, has a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, is preparing to take office, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country ' s population.
The road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly miserable state.
The city was also overloaded by transport at a better time, and from Monday there were steel fences that cut several key routes to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from reaching jobs in the suburbs but to prevent protestors from reaching Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, will interrogate the presidency and take control of the country.
He faces a challenge.
Mexico had achieved good economic performances in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which was now in office, but the country had lost some 60,000 lives in the six-year war on drugs.
“My Government declares to the Mexican people its readiness to fight violence”, Mr. Penya Nyeto, President Barak Obama, said earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that objective.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Penya Nyeto, President of the United States, developed as governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, the views of the new leader were divided.
Plain human
In Vale de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents deserve it to revive tourism, develop resorts and build infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nyeto may be reached, which differ greatly from those of the highlands and the pits that were formerly present.
The tablets bearing his name hang on the modern sports center building and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We share with him the hope of real and serious change”, says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernández, a state congressman from the institutional-revolutionary party (PRI), led by Penya Nyeto.
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, especially in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous membership, the PRI party was forced out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Al Pinos Presidential Palace, the party placed great hopes on Enrique Penya Nyeto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of lack of control put forward by the new President of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to translating his vision of the future of the country.
It's a great public official, and, above all, a man who can listen.
But in the other part of the state, many have a different view of the former governor.
The Municipality of Nesaualkool, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the estacades of highways, it is, in many ways, the suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were recruited to calm down drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
A few dozen bodies of women killed were found in the desert near a large landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the Governorship of Mr. Penya Nyeto, a figure much higher than that in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become violent when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to the opponents, Mr. Penya Nyeto was at best able to say that during his tenure as Governor, he had been unable to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of totally ignoring the problem.
A woman living in a concrete house, like most houses in this rough area, Irena Bouendya has difficulty in holding back tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Moon.
According to an official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family felt that she had been killed by a resident.
"When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed in front of her," she recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already out.
The mother of Mariana leaps through this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to a crucifix, on which a single word is written: justice.
That's what they said was rejected by that family.
"The state's fellow faces treated me like an old gossiper who was upset by a peace breaker.
They want people to just accept the faith of what they say and to be young.
But that's wrong, so can't, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings,' she says.
On Saturday, President Penya Nyeto will take on a heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make the problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Brawaro from the PRI party.
But that is what the victims' families in Ciudad Nesa are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, charges him.
The prosecutors try to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s residence in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence is required to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manninga's detention have been harsh.
The United States Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified material in the history of the United States, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to complain of ill-treatment that he said he had to move while in military prison.
During a cross-examined pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, Major Ashden Fein, the military prosecutor stated that the weekly visits to Manning by prison authorities during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examined in the case of the defence ' s application for termination of Manninga ' s case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were harsh and were in itself sufficient penalties, was held the following day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Wikipedia website.
The Wikipedia resource did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Feyn, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that were completed after visits by the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manningu questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Feine asked for reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he was being treated by the prison administration as “extraordinary” and that the general conditions of detention were “very professionally organized”.
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga has been directly asked about his conditions of detention, claims Feyn.
Manning replied that he had raised oral concerns about those problems and that the representatives of his administration had discussed those problems with him and stated that they would be engaged but did not sign them in writing.
"They wrote "there are no issues" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this issue in a conversation," says Manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that considered the suicide intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during the meeting, he wanted to be removed from the “injury prevention” regime and mitigated the conditions of detention.
Military officials explained that the limited detention regime was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others rather than to prevent suicide.
"I wanted to let the administration know that it's all right with me to cancel the injury prevention regime... that my level of life will improve, in my view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and to his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a naval facility in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness because of the heat.
He explained that it is very difficult for you to know how you're involved and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has appealed to the Camp Arfjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said that he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours a day - alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed only to leave the mattress, blankets, hats, several clothes and glasses.
He says that he was trying to move because he was sleeping or even lying down during the day was a ban on the rules.
Manning said that during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light flashing outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around in bed at night, he said he was woke up and forced to turn around.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Liwenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of security guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning stated that it was not possible to hide the blanket during the inspection.
Replying to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard's order that he should leave a blanket to which he could cover, but admitted that no one had directly told him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he did not pose a risk to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a tusk of rabbits or hats to hurt himself but didn't do it.
That night, according to Manninga's testimony, his underwear, hats, and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the fact that he has had to survive during his detention and will substantially reduce his prison term if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is to begin his trial at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it was planned to invite Manningu to confess guilt for less serious crimes and that other charges should be challenged as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for the weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon asserts that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the regulations governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the allegations put forward by Manningu are aiding the enemy, illicitly promoting the publication of data on the Internet, the transmission of information related to national defence and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted at all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My national self-determination crisis is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico owing to their lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin break between two cultures.
During my recent visit to Mexico City, I walked through the corridor for arriving, approached the border control area, and shut down on the ground.
The signs were two-track: one for Mexicanos (Mexicoians), the other for Extranjoros (foreigners).
I was standing in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my life was called Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I came across the complex design of the American Mexicans.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for symbols or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and started in line for Extranjoros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyeto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was used for the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nyeto was eager to talk about a rise in the Mexican economy that would enable Mexicans to stay in Mexico with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create some North American trading block like the European Union.
In addition, President Penya Nyeto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and full - scale issue for the elderly.
Most Americans never thought of the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory under the influence of rifles.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events everywhere.
Therefore, it is only worth any U.S. State grandebeest to balk at any word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that there are also complaints that Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are carried out with war.
Mexico ' s relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans in the United States are most complex.
Do you want to talk about the offenses?
That's enough.
Mexico has the winners and losers, the people who find opportunities in that country and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Fenices, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin had only one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone, father or grandfather, had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of all, they were Mexicans of a type - striped, poorly educated, poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we will remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today, our lives are the fulfillment of the American dream, we went to good schools and set ourselves up for good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not love us.
We answer them with the same response.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating injuries and treat us as people of the second class, as dehumanizing Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish enough, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to their failure.
If our ancestors were to succeed in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
We wouldn't be just behind the silk curtain right now, finding our lives in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and was legally transferred to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin feel hurt.
She's a U.S. citizen who thinks she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Mexican Americans do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to a Mexican group called Los Tagres del Norte, but Bruce Springstin's favorite.
When you get the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I have discovered during my visit, it is as if our relationship is not too confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors in Mexico and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how nice it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too many offenses in the past.
Given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider the country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but take care of this yourself, aigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for their treatment of Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still at fault for their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is there a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
There are frequent, senseless disputes over who started the first; many buildings converted into ruins; over 140 Palestinians killed, most of whom were civilians; and six Israelis, for the first time in the conflict that was fired from the Gaza Strip, had fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless link between Israelis and Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This may be considered different, but the events of the Arab spring have stirred up a multitude of persistent realities in the rebel storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the windstorm that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggles will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for hoping to break this deadly impasse.
War Without Winrs
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the 21 November cease-fire was signed, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some faction leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million were blocked in one of the world ' s most densely populated and troubled corners, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
The re-emergence regional leader, Turkey, who had once been Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas ' s warring supporters claim to establish an Islamic peninsula around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hizbollah is ruling, to Syria, where the pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s power and further to Jordan, where Hamas ' s allies are threatened by the king ' s authorities.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement increased in President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been destroyed in 2011, was a secular dictator with no particular emphasis on Hamas support.
In contrast, Muslim brothers are an organization that resembles Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was assured.
The Israeli missile system, the Iron Bottle, has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas's missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained steadfast; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of Hamas violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly in the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombings, partly from the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the standpoint of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party, Likud, in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January, has been brought together with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of pandering and giving to the Palestinians the gift of their own State?
If they are given all power over the West Bank, will they launch missiles from there towards Israel, as they do in the Gaza Strip?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to lift their heads up.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; however, their calculations may be denied by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and in other countries are not very fond of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel ' s defence budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The deployment of a war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Murcy, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to no lesser extent, must take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in the Arab countries, deprivation of the Palestinian right to self-determination is a slow-action bomb that will explode in Israel's occupied territories sooner or later, like a bus hit in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already undermines the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, only exacerbates those problems.
For the bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas, the international community has to pay a growing grievance.
Both sides need external impulses
The only solution left remains to which sound representatives from both sides continue to call, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions in exchange for security.
The hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively remains untenable in the short term.
Egypt, which was long overdue in its decision to close arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as to Turkey and Qatar, had a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, which had been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also work towards reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to establish a Palestinian State than the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace settlement plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his reluctance to get involved.
This is a catastrophicly short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
A law on uniform packaging for cigarettes entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the harm to smoking and images of diseased body parts contrast with the low - pitched green boxes that are identical to all cigarette stamps.
The first Australian law on single-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco has come into force in the world, replacing logos and the color of different brands with the same flavour-oiled box with the yellow pictures of sick parts of the body and images of children whose health has been damaged by their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions warning against the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages introduced on this Saturday is the names of stamps, which are printed in the same type.
This is the world's most severe conditions for packaging of tobacco products.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, thus depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This solution was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 out of 100 never became smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring by packaging,” explains Tanya Pilbersec, the Minister of Health, referring to research that shows that, for example, a crown in logo is associated with children with a princess's idea.
Australia is one of the world ' s least smokers, so that these changes will not affect the profit of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering doing so.
The tobacco industry had intensified its opposition to the enactment of the Act.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market on which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those that were conceived by its initiators”, says Scott McIntyre, representative of the British American Globalco company in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more for sale in Australia ' s streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, a small family company, Zico Import Py Ltd claims that the demand for portfolios and sils that conceal unpleasant pictures on the package has increased rapidly (in practice from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tacillco, British Economic Tacillac, Philip Morris and Japan, lost their case in a high court in Australia where they tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico had already implemented some 6,000 wholesaler products and was awaiting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
Experts believe that the popularity of social networks among the target segment of the population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have rendered illegal television advertisements and support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers from exhibiting cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising has moved on the Internet.
The Australian Government had banned local companies and websites from publishing on the Internet, but it could not restrict foreign sites.
“If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet will be extremely tempting”, explains Becky Freeman, who studies public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes that there is an increasing number of trade-marks written by ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't have the strength and time to make a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian office of the British American Centralco states that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new regulations than in advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsored by Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States have filed claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
WTO decision is expected by mid-20 2013.
According to Tani Plebersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory location of smoke-preventing photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Law enforcement is addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia do not respond in a demonstration way to innovation.
These pictures don't pick me up.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just taking a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, buying cigarettes with a picture of a mouth swelling on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yew, manager of the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that a single package made it difficult to put the goods on the shelf
"The sooner I've had time to unload the new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban the cigarettes, and we'd say what to do, okay, it's over, we're closing the store," he says, digging his hands up.
Decorating electronic networks and permanent connections in the world isn't so bad.
On that Day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and had been replaced by another aircraft we waited for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of juice.
I won't lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport, waiting for the flight, is really boring, and there's not much help with books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shopping.
Recently, however, more scientists and professionals in child development have spoken out in favor of schism.
They say that in certain situations, for us and for our children, it's not that bad.
This pushes the brain away from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since we are all constantly facing some screen in the world today, the benefits of drying pass by us.
Should we seek a skate?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll go back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that juice was an invention of a relatively recent time when people had more time to spend.
This is not so, claims Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of the book The Intelligent History of Skocks, 2011 A Live History, Yale Universal Press.
"It can actually boast of a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions of the first century juice were found.
The question of how we understand juice remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Istivide, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of drying have often changed.
Having studied the research material on this subject and asked a question to a task force of 100, Professor Irisud and his colleagues came to the following definition: Scotch is when people “want, but cannot deal with what would bring them satisfaction”.
The difference between scabbing and apathy, he says, is that the boring person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
You don't want to do anything when you're apathetic.
The main thing in the perspiration, he says, is, "The neglect and the consequent deterioration of moods and the feeling that time is slow."
The description of the juice may sound like a depression.
However, Professor Irisud claims that despite the possible link between these conditions, the boring people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and the depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study “Intelligent Minds: The Marking of Attention Debates, ” published in the September issue of Studies on Psychological Science, Professor Irisud and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment that heard the recording of the magazine’s voice.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the television program in the next room, while others heard the same sounds in low volume, so they could hardly be handled, and a third group listened only to the voice record without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard the low-scaling television screens noted that they were bored, others found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons and attributed it to a scab.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the failure to pay attention can cause a bite, says Mark J. Fenceke, an associate neuroscience professor at the University of Gölf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, when we look in the stream of goods on the conway in the search for a marriage, distracting music can help us to avoid a bite."
It seems he goes on to say that when people start to repent in a chair or draw doves on a piece of paper, they do it off a scooter, but now we know that, in fact, such actions are just helping not to give up physically.
“The study found that children who are not prohibited from working and going around learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit in peace” Professor Fenske claims.
At some point, we're all running a skunk, with the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech by looking at an interesting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of scab.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “sleeal of scabbing” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and contentions are used to determine such a scale, for example, "Many of what I have to do are uniformly and monotonous" or "I'm too much interested, so there's no time."
Through such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Stephen Vodanović, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there are many external irritors.
In general, however, adolescents often miss at all.
In 1991, Ryd Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
However, only 3 per cent of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he doesn't have any data on how that kind of juice would be, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that “adolescent age is the peak of a scab”, largely because children and adolescents are unable to fully decide what to do with them.
Let's go back to my original question: "Sweeping is a trick?
Sometimes it is not because, in extremes, research shows, it can cause people to act absurdly and dangerously, to risk gambling, or to abuse certain substances in an attempt to get rid of juice.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the relationship between scooting and creativity, says Professor Vodanović, who devoted himself to studying the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that something else should be done; that's what's called a juice," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this brain does not always know what better to do.
If you're bored and you're going to put that energy on a guitar game or a culinary experience, you're going to make yourself better.
But if you watch TV, it'll only be better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child misses and you give him iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight the juice alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment, Professor Fenceke says.
"And these self-regulation skills are engaged in a wide range of situations," he argues.
Your child learns not only to be self-employed, he also learns self-monitoring at all.
I don't think it's something you've got to do with juice.
But it's not worth it, either.
Rather, we need to learn to feel comfortable even beyond the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Ideed agrees with that.
"We see it in a way that we need to experience it more frequently, and that the skin is a very unpleasant, unfathomable desire to do something conscious," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant concerns and just to relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
Until it is clear how a new law on legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orrosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a general college student in the south-east of Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence, namely, that he will soon be absolutely lawful throughout the state: keeping a small amount of marijuana and the tube he smoked.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamara and drove in a car at the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After finding marijuana in the car, Mr. Orrosco came to the court for possession of drugs and drug use equipment, minor offences for which a fine of $100 was due, and the date of the trial was fixed.
"We're treated as criminals," Mr. Orrosco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted several weeks after Colorado voted in favour of legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of review.
The charges of minor marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges against people aged 21 and older to hold small doses, which will be considered legal once the law enters into force within a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to be held accountable for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver suburbs to the western mountains, they vote to prevent the arrival of new, licensed marijuana sales shops.
"It's all developing so fast that I don't even know what's going on," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in Avor's town east of Denver.
The supervisory authorities in Washington have also been amazed at the honor of their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in solving marijuana issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for the Management of Alcohol Production and Marketing in the State of Washington.
But now no one can do more, he acknowledges, Mr. Smith, than to make a proposal and hopes that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into a state of uncertainty for a year when State licensing systems are not yet in place and the right of possession of marijuana is legal.
There are still complex technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's regulation on “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana, prohibiting its trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in the model of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, representative of the newly established research group “Centre for Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Avrora sent an e-mail report that the City Public Prosecutor ' s Office would no longer hold persons who had reached the age of 21 in charge of possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stopped exposing people to these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Outs, reported that the police would monitor the implementation of the regulations governing those who were growing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug dealers in the city.
The Prosecutor of the district of Ould in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to be held accountable for possession of marijuana, primarily to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At this time, 119 persons have been charged with holding two or less marginalizations of marijuana, although many of them have been accused of other violations.
“The obligation of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered to be criminal at the time they are committed”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa Rural District, where voting was rejected by the participants on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of a small number of drugs.
The district prosecutor, Piet Hautchinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges of already open cases involving the storage of marijuana.
"I believe to enforce the law until it changes -- our direct duty," he says.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the population of Colorado who voted supported the decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different states has revealed the mixed attitude of local authorities in the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier” explains Sean Maquilister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Marjuana Law Reform Organization.
"They have been chasing people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, D.C., the first states where a small number of marijuanas are like alcohol, are meant to become a country-wide experimental field to verify the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalization officials and state officials plan to expand the area of legalized trade, but at the same time they look forward with fear to instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana hopes that the Office of Justice will do so.
Despite a few high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana on medical grounds, the federal Government in most cases has been good for the medical trade of marijuana in Colorado, Washington, D.C. and 16 other states.
The Anti-Narcotics Office's agents are unlikely to enter their homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes on the recreational marijuana stores of the government-controlled state, which are permitted under the new law, consider Kevin A. Sabet, former drug control adviser in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marketing shops, which could not have been opened before a year later.
Last week Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, introduced a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we're going to grant a licence to somebody, and then it's going to raise serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petrella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
University students' persecution for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember myself, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, the modern equivalent of an ancient symposium laying down the two pillars of civilization - freedom and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the history school of the University of Oxford College at the end of the eightieths, I collected suitcases and left, which came into the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and cried.
Friends were shot down.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in a neighboring room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson made a joke that I was leaving because I had to drink from the scurvy cups.
In fact, everything was not so fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was systematically digested and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in private school.
It was only for one reason, and in this glorified cycle of enlightenment, it looked really barbarous and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow White, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a conservator.
Why are you asking me now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students holding legal centristist views is subject to the same grass.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of co-conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those accorded to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators at Corpus Christi College College College in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, attacked and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student policy, “Smart of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right”, in which conservators presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of Conservators of Oxford University, who rides on Rolls Roys, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knuckle.
In other universities, the conservatives complain that they make up the “loss of vacations because of higher school fees”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President, Association of Conservators of Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that “the university environment is experiencing a shift towards left-wing views.
The people who don't even know us think we're naked and lewd by the children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history school of Corpus Christy, in which a request was made to strengthen the defence, calls this atmosphere “unintelligible” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, says that the attitude of members of the student club towards legalists has deteriorated considerably.
“It is a threat both to an atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members”, she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a laborful and exhausted 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford has been a source of hatred for the conservative party.
One year earlier, a student, Margaret Tetcher, had been dismissed by a vote because of a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the sanctuaries would be unhygienic.
In the early days of the year, when the students were getting to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was waiting ahead.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers on the digestive digestion of the conservatorials, but they were happy to participate in it.
Political issues - mine strikes, privatization and Government opposition to sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa - have entered through the wooden panels of the audience.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared to do so.
"Mrs. White," said the teacher, who is now the late Harry Pete, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very greedy man with a cake-like face.
"There are basically no French students, or are there just enough brains for them?" he asked.
The other students were in love.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I wish you could take some initial French lessons in your spare time, if you're not very busy going back into society," was Pete's handcuff.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting at dinner alone; then someone fucked me up.
It was James, a second-year student from the English School, who was introduced as a member of the University Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case will be as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservators will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more difficult.
Most of the pre-conservators pretend to be laborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was a coward trying to hurt myself.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Tetcher said.
It didn't work out.
The head of the Faculty of Philosophy, Policy and Economics, who studied at Eton himself, said: "You are a Fascist pig's daughter.
You're contagious."
Other students took his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives do sex?" asked one of them.
- They're rocking each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt homosexual until I eliminated criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I going to have to date the likes only under cover of night?
Would I be forced to become a lebourist and hide my true convictions?
For the next three years, I have begun to feel like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservator but also for being Tetcher's adviser on foreign policy and one of her peers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his provinciality, his melodies and his commitment to Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said to me.
I started going to Oxford home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unforeseeable capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieths, all political views were adopted.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- There's no way they can do this, except in the city of drifting pins...
Even my Communist friends always acted irreprehensibly."
His wet eyes are troubled.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're gonna break my heart if you leave the university."
I was tired of a permanent trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, too, the conservator, did not resist the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week, during the seminar, when the next history teacher called me "the heart of the people," I decided to do the same.
In my heart, I felt ashamed to say, "I've been brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
It wasn't long before that.
The last nail in the roof of my career in Oxford was determined to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdok.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I collected a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a flatter and a snitch.
But at 18 years of age, no one should be subjected to such atrocities and intimidation at the educational institution.
Even worse, it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen Prime Ministers of the thorium, but was also still hiding behind the undeservede reputation of a university that valued equality and freedom of expression.
"Vlenintino prefers the elegance of glory."
"Valentino: Scotch," which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz, and other well-known clients of the Italian designer
Summerhouse House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in British capital to accept an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of the Valentyno Arter, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that has brought together more than 130 high - fashion dresses created by his home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is Garavani's 'il Black', but she could not have been written without his name clients.
Valentino always felt charming to the rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, which was opened until 3 March, personal letters and photographs of the signature of the most prominent aristocratics, from Princess Salem Ag-Han to Lord Snowyon, including Marie-Santal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social recovery, from the humble port city of Vogera in northern Italy to the cumir of the international elite.
Being in love with a royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They don't at least burn their cigarettes about your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Brnemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an indescribable master and receives guests with generosity and elegantness.
"We all liked to come to his helmet in Gtashada," explains the former wife of Hayni Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautys like Marella Annelly or Eugia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Macea, representing Valentino
The Argentine model of Valérie Machi recalls a charismatic model.
Once we went home to dinner, it was after showing a fashion on Spain’s square in Rome, many years ago.
Among those invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Stil Valentino showed himself in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in her food, in his music.
"Each of Valentino's guests had to feel important and loved," recalls the "top model" that started with the designer in 1995 during the High Model Week in Paris.
"He never gets out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she ends.
[Symbolic]
Garavani's life is a story, not of obsession, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a 60-metre glomerulus in length, which offers a role shift: the visitor takes the role of the models and must defile the podium, the sower's so - called 's 's' from the gres, that is, the seductors from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for his wedding with Ariston Onassis, the suit that was used by Monica Witty in Nochi, or the coat of hair and skin that belonged to Fara Diba.
The names of models include Cibil Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Tacis, Matte-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Natti Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these customers say that Valentino is the first love to forget.
I remember him beautiful.
They were trousers, shirts, jackets and jackets from the autumn-star collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the tools of the designer.
"I'm counting him on the rest of his femininity, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the color that he uses: they've got a lot of light and they're coming up to his face.
The ratio is perfect.
The princess and the fashion legislator Patricia D. Jawampaol d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening restrooms...
Finally, it was in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on for a holiday at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a bag of fences, a scorge in a warehouse, and a cut without a wallet.
"It was a dream that turned out to be," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is non-recurrent," explains this Italian aristocratic who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps his party dresses from a designer with "maximum caution", because dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying it."
Models
The great finale of the show at the Somerset House — the wedding dress of Marie-Santal Miller for her wedding with Pavras in Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “debts” (called the designer of his neck) to produce this silk-colored ivory ring with an infiltration of the pearl, twelve species of various circles and a section of six feet [4 and a half m].
According to journalist Susie Menques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, dress is a high - ranking fashion of the end of the twentieth century, “the return of the highest-world clients”.
The masquerade for many years of the elite's “state of life” is now Valentino herself the best representative of hers.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Chamber, the Commander of the Arts and Words Order, appointed by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavani collected the same honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"Wherever my attention was drawn to his subtleness, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, I saw him a month ago at a solemn dinner in the Museum of Orse.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there is no time for him."
If that's what Princess says...
World's worst profession: miners from Kawah-Igen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health, hoisting 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on a steep stone tropics
There are people for whom their work is hell, while others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living sulphur mining in Kawah-Igen volcano located in the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
On each day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crane, where the sulphuric gas rises from the depths of the Earth and falls into contact with the air.
He puts them in two bamboo baskets, calls baskets on his shoulders, and carries them upstairs on a rocky stone road.
The volcano, which has a height of 2,386 metres, is only 250 metres high, but it takes more than 40 minutes to rise the turtle, with difficulty holding a balance and a cautious footpath so as not to get down or fall out of the crash.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who broke off a cliff a few years ago.
The gamers from Kawakh Igen earn five euros per kilo of sulphur that survives
Upon their return, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were apes from the circus, and there were no heavy baskets, walking three kilometres to the weights that the mining company had set up slightly higher, at a height of 1,850 feet [1,850 m].
It is a PT of Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise operating this volcano since 1960 and not, rather, of its employees, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every pound of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of oil-based production, since this mineral is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamics, and even the salinization of sugar.
“As the rule is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (1.8 euros) per trip,” explains Anto, who usually carries three daily traffics.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the day feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a myth for such a inhumane effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
" The daily salaries of miners are very high at local levels, where the price for coffee collection is 15,000 rupees (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (Euro167) " , explains the loader who used to work as a stoneman on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the site was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banjuvanga, a town not far from the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the Sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's always coughing, and he's got his eyes coming up because of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawakh-Igen, whose series had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's always coughing, and he's going to have eyes coming up because of the toxic gases that he's releasing the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay for his dream.
"I'm gonna work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises for more than an acceptable English.
A life - threatening young man could be a tourist guide, a waitress, or a hotel port, but instead he does the work of mud.
The business of a dirty wooden cabin with other wearers, it stands every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sire doesn't stop running out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the darkness.
To challenge the shadows, Anto descends into the mole, covering the road with a small fountain connected to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
Approximately 400 bowels melt baskets with sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to wearers who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo charges which, along with an entry ticket for 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros), are taken from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its Muslim people.
"It's a job for cattle, not for humans," says Babidsin, a royal nodulesman of 42 years, who has spent three decades at Kawah-Jenj since the college left.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures us that he'll have to endure work as long as he can, because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur is burning its throat and chewing its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and captures miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so suffocating that no one complains about his severe diseases... more serious than their common problems of breathing, atros, pain in his knees, and rages on his shoulders, which were deformed under the gravity of the basket.
By balancing a basket on its back, the Connika can only raise 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions remove 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a storage site in Tamsanari, traveling 18 miles [18 km] across a narrow cable among the ages.
“I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life,” says Unintention, wide opening up a mouth that lacks multiple teeth.
Of his five children, age 30, he also works as a sulphur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the worst occupations in the world: what human flies do from Kawah-Igen.
Singapore was looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing and education prices in the absence of children.
“The Singapore population needs to grow”.
I'm the patriarch's husband, you're my patriarchy's husband, we're fulfilling our civic duty and we're going to make life!
It may seem unlikely that these lines are part of an ad for soft blades, but, despite that, or maybe so, this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local phrases like "Let's put a bao in a liver" to laugh at Singapore's fertility rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to this issue in entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to fulfill their “national debt”.
It's only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce, so we felt that this was the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had tried to do much, for example, to start a spirit with pheromones or to organize a quick dating party.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but have not worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore Government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to produce more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But it's all very effective.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city State in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and strict public control.
Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 - known as the replacement rate - in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Council of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, said that the reason for “higher education” and “higher career opportunities”.
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family creation”, she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the retention of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in the fertility rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which are aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population decline, are causing resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where xenophobia is barely hidden against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore obtained the worst outcome in elections since independence.
After the election, an attempt was made to resolve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenditure and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so many small houses.
For example, this has begun to influence the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has gone into control of the number of small apartments known as the "extreme box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square metres of apartments are sold very well.
Nevertheless, it is felt that they can promote a long life and discourage the incentives of builders who want to build large families.
But Lima Yu Sun, director general of the EL Development firm, says that their "outboard boxes" are sold much faster than the more simple copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that these apartments are being occupied for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues have increased.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidance for the constructioners, who had previously had had had had had had had a negative attitude if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overloaded
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have a special effect.
"People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people are delaying this," says a young management officer.
Others may have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the Government has tried to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Personal on-line online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a personal or “the realm of personal life which is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he use this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the danger he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that are likely not to be shared on the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "what's very mine" in the personal plane, and "a password and the name of the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have downloaded," says 10-year-old Jorge, when he's trying to explain the meaning of a personal site like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I'm downloading beautiful pictures or games pictures.
Also, I am having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish pictures of people who are disfavorive, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures us that he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his floulers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows that she has a password for one of the records.
I've got Twitter to express myself and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if I'm answering them, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertainment, I can talk to family members or to my friends in a quick way," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never have accepted a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't think of someone who recommended it to a stranger.
José's 14-year-old case is different.
This adolescent has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter recognizes that 20 persons added to his list of friends do not know.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was sure about him or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they force or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account”, he admits.
José became the follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy's experience is no stranger to what he knows today as cyberbbing.
A well - known friend of mine was blackmailing the social network.
He was threatened and bought with money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not remove the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to adjust the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download pictures of familiar people in uncomfortable or Confucian situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if a person I don't like or if I want to.
"If I know it's cyberbibing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marélos Porras, a teacher in English and a teacher in education and education, believes that to direct children and adolescents, it must be understood that the aim of social networks is to inform.
"The internet has appeared as a tool for finding information, but the game rules have changed with the creation of these sites," she says.
Porras points out that Academy Mark Pranski, a professor of education at Yale University and author of work, has developed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are they, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
Explains that this subject is complex, “because we ask them to have some criterion that you can or can't disseminate, to publish or to speak, at an age when maturity is insufficient to do so”.
"So that they may be elected, while most importantly they should be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that children and adolescents are confidential is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like it if you published a picture of someone you published about your friend?
Do you know others are publishing about you?
When you sign photographs from a party, do you ask other people for permission to observe them?
And one more thing, does everybody need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them realize that they have to act online just as they do online.
The rules are the same.
“It is a person who acts with respect, responsibility and other principles on the Internet, as it should be on social networks,” she claims.
Vigilance
The need for heads of families to read policies of social networks in good faith is explained by Estudado Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and a consultant in education.
When they understand each item, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he says.
According to Gurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "do not speak to strangers."
The WNASUR Summit ends without a declaration of the Lima Declaration
The President ' s summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has now concluded in Peru without the proclamation of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at VI of the next WANSD meeting of Heads of State and Government, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration indicated that it will be transferred after the closure, but then confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at some point.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Olyanta Umala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound of a "closed meeting, no sound" message.
A few of the information circulated among the reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some of the Governments of the UPSD present at the meeting, but not by Peruvians.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian administration sent an electronic media message to the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Omala's statement, rather than an official document that concluded the summit.
In the past October, Peru had hosted the Third Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (SAPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, had not been circulated, despite its persistent demand for the press.
On the official ASPA website, you can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had attempted to provide transmission systems for all journalists, but to limit information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit was also concluded by a joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Hague Court, which would settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague, as part of the charge made by Lima against Santiago.
“We will respect and execute a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently submitting to this international court”, said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“There has been, and will be, a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, added Pinner, and welcomed the hands of Omala in the flag background of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia had protested this week ' s Bogotá Pact, according to which it had recognized the subjection of the verdicts of that international court to Nicaragua, which it had found to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rucef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UPSD had been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State read out the outcome document, which stated that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements that had been adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UPSD would take “important steps towards the goal of South American nationality for which we were expanding the agreements on the place of residence”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “work against the lack of confidence of citizens and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to affordable Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take into account the combined and effective risk of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphal foundation but should serve to expand our productive base and to foresee a better future for our cities”, added Umala.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 marking projects that will improve South America’s link between areas of space, especially in village and border areas... by uniting our countries and forming new economic patterns”, said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to cross-sectional axles in its territory, from coast to Brazil, and two focused on greater communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as a re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace would be united, with good relations among its neighbours, is another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting to participate in a regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortego, on Saturday, in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogota.
"On Saturday, we may meet President Daniel Ortego," said Santos.
“We have to review all these ways, and they are not mutually exclusive, including the covenant with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"To President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will have a presence as new President of that country, Enrique Penya Nyeto.
Also at the summit, the defence ministers of the blockade met provisionally to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the question of the integration of nationality” Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Raphael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, declared to the State television of Peru that the Europeans “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes,“but now they are almost one domesticity”.
It has, in this context, protected the South American Citizenship Project, which commends the States parties to the UPSD.
“To ensure free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that wish to bring us back to the past”, he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also expressed himself as a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never make a commitment, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and financed by the United States”, he stated, referring to political asylum by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that she did not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, in due course, “there were certain suspicions that Assangj would be extradited to a third country and would not comply with the process”.
He has also criticized Swedish justice for requiring a visit to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual crime, while “sometimes Swedish law considers it possible to implement it by means of a video conference that could be made from Ecuador's Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assanja's physical and mental health.
“I haven't talked to him since he arrived at our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he had a little leftist problem, nothing serious," said Ecuador’s head of State.
What really exists is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to the sinking in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the asylum problem provided by Assanjo since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of integrity that would enable him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of the British, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and stressed that negotiations had been held in London to find a solution to the problem of co-founder Wikipedia.
We are not negotiating human rights, it is a word we have not used in this case, but we have been constantly discussing.
“The problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because the lawyer Assanja, Baltassar Garson, has been running a number of trials in various European institutions”, he mentioned.
And he said, "If Britain gives a guarantee tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as is well permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, will interrogate or interrogate Mr. Assanja at Ecuador's Embassy in London, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took this opportunity to show herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that she did not tolerate “the mediation, the integrity and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
“The great enemies of freedom of the press are not the spoiled criminals of politics, but the bad journalists, who support the profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he remained happy that none of these journalists, “neither bankers nor bourgeois countries dominate Ecuador” and added that when he was re-elected, he would “buy the revolution to continue his development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to preserve Paraguay's veto in UPSD until at least the following elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for the coups under the rule of law” because, in fact, “this has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuador President also considered that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos had now agreed to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had been in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together in order to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also looked forward to a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime boundaries before the same court in Chile and Peru, and said that “it is appropriate for Latin America to resort to international jurisdiction if two countries undertake to make a decision, however difficult it is”.
With regard to the opportunity to present himself as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult”.
Correa assured me that if she lost her election in February 2013, she would be out of public life.
In personal terms, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must recognize that responsibility," he said.
If we won, it would be my last term as President, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss a campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn't mean that President Chavez's health is getting worse,” he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today - a late diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS analysis had been successful.
"I'm kind of deaf," he remembers the hard one, despite the doctor's tactics, the moment.
A young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the illness on his own, he wanted to know it as much as possible, and his efforts proved true, he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the oldest HIV patients in 1994 who have overcome many obstacles.
He's been living with the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would have been hard to believe that there were too little treatment options, too little knowledge of disease, too little prejudiced about patients.
Yes, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection Hospital didn't want to say good-bye to him, 'because he was cut off.'
In other words, AIDS was a judgment at that time.
It is now possible to survive and do so without damaging the quality of life.
However, without knowing their illness, many people still come when the virus is already in harm, have “saturated” their immune system, and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a greater achievement to date is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population in the same manner”, indicated the chapter on HIV, Hyme Andrad Villanueva, referring to this information confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrada Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a sentence, but life expectancy and quality depends on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of diagnostics with better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years of age when 500 CD4 is reported.
Rather, it means that whoever receives HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “to maintain control, to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy for Mexicans is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the beginning of AIDS.
It is only in Khalisco that 255 people died in 2011 and there are already 187 deaths by May this year; however, it is alleged that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why is there a flight outcome still there?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I think it's going to be in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we had no shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients are very late because they don't know their condition, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He cited the shocking evidence: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to do to have a greater impact on total mortality is to perform diagnostics at an earlier stage and therefore to provide mass detection samples for all the people who ask for it.”
In his proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as patients like Fabricio, who sought testing at a private laboratory only what a friend did and, despite his youth, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered by the Spároshi sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which was one of the widespread complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"As far as death is concerned, it's better that I wear three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I'm good at eating, I'm doing exercise, I'm taking medication.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live normal lives like any other.
"I've been working, I've got a lot of exercise, I've been traveling, having an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of myself and someone else," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to match his statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let it be checked if there is a risk of infection, if they know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive, that's better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Reserved by Board
The great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is attributed to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalakhara, who has been involved in HIV-related problems.
And the biggest prevention.
In the field on this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before we've been given one or two, now we're getting hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" It's a popular question, with epidation and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, appetites and health workers, who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I suggest a change in this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not just behind the counters and that a hundred of them be on automatic machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It's not the promotion of loose conduct.
It was not about the payment of a beer and a motel, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked whether condom distributions could be provided in his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms accessible to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
13.435 total cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) were recorded.
The State is the fourth highest national ranking on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of infections are sexually transmitted, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent by perpetal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people on one recorded case who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision to cancel the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario establishes a long-term precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has a problem with capacity to pay.
Procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws do not seem to be valid in the country of lanes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale to the courts of bankruptcy in northern Texas, leaves defenceless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door of the lead glass manufacturer in Mexico to address the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an admission, the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of the insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was established to this end, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of the debt production that was owed to the parent company by the Vitoro affiliates, no majority would have been reached to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, it is an opportunity to recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitions.
It is also true that, in one way or another, the creditors Vitro who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely, Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Ellito Internacional and Livepol Limited, would not have reached the majority.
Voting would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are released by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation he has experienced since 2008, which has been affected by the severe economic crisis that has hit the United States by attacking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal to have the vote taken before its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, a certification request will be filed, which will require a review by the highest court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The worst thing is that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“other court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it was exonerating itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karabol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In the light of the delayed complaints made on the table by trade unions (Mexicana de Aviación) against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the trade union of aviator pilots has already discovered a bottle tail.

The beautiful basketball traveler Hector Hatin Reyes was linked to this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hatin Reyes.
And before he was bleeding in his brain, in 2008, Reyes was caught in sports for more than 60 years, as a player in small categories, a player in the Supreme Basketball League, the Commissioner and head of the BSN with the Bovboys of Bamomon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as I was President BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of which are adorned with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long journey, bear witness to this.
A Bright in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through Kovboev from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old in his role as a agent or contract agent.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed most because I had been able to be part of eight Covboev champions since 1967, as an agent, an agent or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five champions, who passed from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Minsy in the BSN.
Since then, Kokoko Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has continued to lead the leadership, according to Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was on his way to Alabama University, who said to me, "I've got a very strong player for you, a big 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And this was the beginning of Minsk, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended the Sniper Raymond Gaussa, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minds were to bring Biyamon's championship, Gauss would help win another.
I enjoyed the Kovboev championship with Hauss, but now it's a distance, because by 1988, I had already been the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy its achievements and the achievements of Minsk in the national assembly.
I remember the first time we won in the United States during the Olympic qualification tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got our fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, had it not been for the other Canadian judge who forced us to win the final game, said Reyes.
But the 1990 World Cup team is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just as she won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke up the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won us a bronze on the world's championship.
Not only were Minsk, Gausa, Ramona Rivas, Fiko Lopez, and Picuslina, but they were also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colón and James Carter, Leon's brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Khiot' Morales, who were unable to participate in 90 years because of knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tour in Neucen, Argentina.
With role players like Kanito Nieves, Pablo Alisa and young Rolando Hurruitner to replace the players suspended for disorder in the Mar del Plata Pan American championship, we won gold in spite of all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance on the international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Pikulin did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young girl including Julio Toro, Flora Mellandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I love Leo Arilla's job.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous national assembly era between 1988 and 1995 and that there were up to 17 teams in the early 1990s in the BSN.
What do you want to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponse should play only in their own area and only against teams from other parts of the island in their national tribe.
Now the kids are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of the mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I'm listening to music, watching the music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandkids, and I'm going out for basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the society of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Killer Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Water, Texas, became world-known because of his primary role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R, in the television series “Dalsa”, where he was a businessman without principles, evil and manipulation.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil-breader JAr Yuing in the "Dallas" TV series was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Balsa season, died on Friday night because of the complications caused by cancer, according to the family ' s statement for The Associated Press, by Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to her beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the signal role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at Dallas on a fair for the Day of Grass.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original show and in the Squivel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dalsa Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He was happy for all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gentle and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a life full," confirmed Graham in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995, he discovered a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Long before "Dallasa", Hegman was known on television because of his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Janenie" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
He was playing Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets an attractive wife-jinna, who's playing Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of the two comedians who rarely appeared on air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles well accepted by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his master's interpretation of the amazingly repulsive J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of the glory.
The drama series CBS on the Yuingov clan and other characters in its surroundings was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who Shooted J.R.?" designed to make noise around an episode full of emotion, where Hagman's character almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookery offices.
This has also helped bring a record audience to the show at that time.
When the interview was given in November 1980, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned the “Dallas” into a second-hand entertainment program in history, after the “MASH” final in 1983, involving 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Christine, who shot at him.
J.R. made her sick and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businesser and a bad husband who wanted his wife to be an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey) to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R's tomb," said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where an honest citizen J.R. Yuing will fall."
It's the only deal he lost.
Princesipal's Victoria, also original film heroin, remembered on Friday, Hegman's mind as someone who's either "worn on or outside the screen."
He is both invisible and irreplaceable to millions of readers all over the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of the Delta were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of the five episodes of the second season and the sixth one in production had already been completed, the channel was reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the show after Hegman left.
He was the son of an actress and a singer, Mary Martin, who got stuck in classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He was happy at the theaters of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the English Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Maj Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many famous people live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs Hello Darlin: Tal (and Absolutile True)
"I didn't include anything in it that would think could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he said to Prensa Asociada at that time.
After the liver was transplanted, he began to promote organ donorship and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them to scratch, meet them when they're on operations, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little awkward for a little while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course to study the End of the Light is in progress.
Every week, students study apolytic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this session, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an indistinguishable bait: the end of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which was captured by many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: the devastating hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long-agoneddon” and the growing conflict between Israel and the place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that the Apolypsis will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apolytic of all," said Sharma this week at the University of Rutgers Kamden (New Jersey).
If you look at what's happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who have an apolytic attitude.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" at this Semistre, theoretically last in history.
At The Templ University, associate Professor Barry W. W.A., the course is entitled "The Media, Culture and World End."
Each week, students study apolytic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We examine why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way in which the hypothetical scenarios that give rise to certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students examined films on apolytic topics and examined how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be true and impossible," said Vacker.
At the head of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall of Latin America and his colleague Amar Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the "immutable destruction", students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be passed on to the Acapalipsis canon, which leaves students with no choice but to work “until the night in which the world is supposed to end,” said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The town ended in two hours," said Restall about her high-level student course, for which 35 students were enrolled.
We've been receiving e-mails for many weeks before starting a seedster from people who have asked if there are other places.
Students, in turn, claim that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Kamden.
And the apolytic view of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Veques, a 25-year-old student in the department of psychology and nursing, said that he had watched all the apolytic films.
"I never heard of a course that would teach this," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- not to mention Professor -- said he believed on the day of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected the Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Templin University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
He noted, however, that there is an apolytic concern in Western culture, which includes several centuries where people respond to changes around themselves when they predict the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Most of all in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question as to whether he was aware of any course on "the End of the World" there.
"The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world," he wrote to the higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restalt pointed out that many days of the last court had been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people will immediately start to think about the next date” or to philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers do not care about this date.
Some said they're going to go to "the End of the World".
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student of the Department of Communications.
