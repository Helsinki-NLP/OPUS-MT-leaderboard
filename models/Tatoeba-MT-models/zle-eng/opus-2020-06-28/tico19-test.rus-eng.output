The rapid increase in the incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020 was due to increase.
The cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) is similar in the European Union / Economic Area and in Great Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the CID19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to increase the preparedness of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia were reported in Hubaei, Uhan, China Province, by unknown ethics.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of cancer is now known as a second type of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
From that point on, the disease caused by ATS-ComV-2 began to be referred to as a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVD-19 suffer from a mild disease, i.e. in the form of an infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority of those who are infected.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop in a more severe form, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The rate of death of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study examines and compares the cumulative morbidity of COVID19 in each European Union (EU)/Economic Area (EEZ) and in the United Kingdom with the trends in the Chinese province of Hubay.
We also compare the current number of COVID19 cases in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEZ and Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID 19 pandemic.
Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/EEZ were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returned from Hubaei Province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEA and British countries, with 39,768 cases of infection reported in the period from 31 December 2019 to that date and 1,727, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, accounted for only Italy.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID19
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country from official sources such as the Ministries of Health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO on a daily basis.
These data are used to analyse trends in the diffusion of COVID-19 in the EU/EEZ and in Great Britain and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was estimated to be the cumulative cumulative morbidity of CVID19 for 14 days, taking into account the usual COVID19 current in each EU/EEZ country and in Great Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also submitted the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EEZ countries and Great Britain
The development of an increasing cumulative CVID19 disease in the 14-day period in the EU/EEZ countries and in the United Kingdom was generally consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubay (Figure 1).
The cumulative morbidity of COVID19 in the EU/EEZ and in Britain as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump (additional material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEEA countries and in Britain, there was a similar trend towards the cumulative morbidity of CVID19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of CVID19 in EU/EEZ countries and in Great Britain, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA and British countries is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom.
The observed trends in the cumulative morbidity of COVID19 suggest that the pandemic develops at a comparable rate in all countries.
Despite different stages in different countries, there are differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different patient selection rules for the analysis of COVID-19, including “trusting” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already at the peak.
To date, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (not reported).
However, such data should be systematically collected to supplement current monitoring data, which include the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated report of the ECDC on the COVID-19 Espression Risk Assessment presents scenarios for the modelling of the loading of health system resources with estimates for hospitalization of CVID-19 infected in each EU/EEEA country and in Britain, where the risk of a shortage of affordable cohorts in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are currently grouped according to certain EU/EEZ and British regions, and intensive treatment hospitals and units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide territorial units for statistical purposes at the 2nd level (NUTS-2) as far as possible.
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom ' s COVID-19 pandemic are rapidly developing.
Consequently, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices should be prepared for the long-term contact infection scenario of ATS-COV-2 and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which could be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the recent ECDC report on risk exemplars, it is important to contain the spread of ATS-COV-2 an operational, proactive and integrated approach, and then to move from containing to minimizing the consequences, since given the projected rapid growth in the number of disease-taking, it may simply not be sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to reflect, adopt and adjust their response accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on risk exempeals also listed public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can increase their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of ATS-ComV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, intensive care will be required in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries.
The outbreak of coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronary severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of the second type (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: at present, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries around the world, and more than 80,000 people have been infected.
Like the ATS-ComV homologian virus, which has developed a severe respiratory syndrome of thousands of people in 2003, ATS-ComV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and produce similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower degree of severity and lower mortality rates than ATS, but it is much more contagious and has an impact on older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on the new disease, this article proposes a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethics, viruses, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of further currentity and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eliminate a dangerous disease.
The spring festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January in 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home throughout and for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of conformity with the coronary syndrome (CoV) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called the virus ATS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called the coronal virus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID19 cases were detected, more than 40,000 patients were cured, and more than 3,000 died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “rough number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 were produced in less than two months, including articles on its viruses, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, beginning with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with ATS and other coronary diseases — the coronary virus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was struck in 2012.
We will also discuss current evidence of prevention and forecasting of disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
The Corovals have traditionally been pathogens, which are not fatal to humans and are mainly responsible for about 15 percent of the total respiratory disease.
However, in this century, we have twice experienced high-pathogenic coronary -- namely, the coronation of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SAR-COV-2) and the Northern Respiratory syndrome (MERS-ComV), which caused the outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and were soon extended to many other States with a terrible level of severity of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC of Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the virus’s genetic sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case in Uhan was recorded.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that health workers were infected and that it was possible to transmit the virus to a person.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to a first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Huhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the tsunami outbreak is a global public health emergency.
By the time the report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already entered some 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and risk of outbreaks have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multidisciplinary clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed CVID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of epidemic development (https://mp.webin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_RHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The infections of ATS-ComV-2 were exposed to all age groups, but people aged 30 to 65 were mostly ill.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 had not yet reached the age of 10.
Inflation of ATS-ComV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly by clusters in Hubay Province and in the surrounding regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days passed from the time of CVID19 symptoms to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2 days).
The average number of symptoms before death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which had occurred over time with extensive transport on the eve of the New Year's Chinese celebration.
Mortality among confirmed diagnosed patients was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID19 were: gender (male), age (?60) and severe pneumonia.
The Crowns are a subsidiary of large shell viruses containing one string of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and bactoruvirals are known to be striking people.
In the event of damage by corals of the SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of the shell-veloin (S) is connected to cell receptors of the angiotensin-preventing enzyme of the 2nd type (ACE2) and dipedalyptidaze 4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the gene of the virulent RNA; after the reproductive of the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with the fibrous glycoproteins and proteins of nucleocapse, produces virion-based vesikules, which then merge with the membrane of the cell by releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genetic sequence of ATS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that ATS-CoV-2 is a new type of beetaruviruz whose genome of 99.98% coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first day of the outbreak of disease in the marine product market of Huang in Uhan.
Genetically SARS-ComV-2 is closer to CARS-ComV than MARS-ComV.
SARS-COV-2 was detected in human respiratory respiration from an e-spiration microscopic particle.
A human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for ATS-ComV-2, as well as for ATS-ComV.
However, S-Protestin SARS-ComV-2 is associated with an ACE2 enzyme that is weaker than ATS-ComV, which explains the fact that SARS-ComV-2 causes patients to have a lower degree of severity than SARS-ComV.
ATS-ComV-2 may also generate previously unknown short-lived whites encoded orf3b and a secret protein encoded orf8.
SARS-ComV-2 can play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the IFNC Express; however, either orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motivation.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors, headed by Zhou, submitted reports on the crystalline structure of the fully fledged ACE2 enzyme with a B0AT1 transporter.
They discovered that this complex, which included open and closed information, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which was evidence in recognition of and infection with Cavinaurus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target in a drug screening for the suppression of ATS-COV-2 infection.
Origin and Host
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to the man through the citils and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of ATS-CoV-2 with other coronaries, it has been found that the first masters of ATS-CoV-2 are flying mice, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two types of SARS cruiser like SL-COVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of host the virus has become, enabling it to overcome a species of barrier and to cause human infection, and the way of transfer is still to be found.
Mr. Jiz (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the virus vectors from flying mice had become snakes, during which the homological recombination in S-protein had taken place.
Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that pangolins — long-term mammals that feed ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate masters of ATS-ComV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarities between the Pangolin Coraline Corn and SARS-COV-2.
However, the difference in 1% distributed between the two genes is still very large, so it is considered that final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (figure 33).
Most of the physical and chemical properties of ATS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
In the laboratory conditions, ATS-ComV and MERS-ComV may survive for 48 hours in the dry environment, up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent of humidity.
SARS-ComV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that ATS-ComV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C within 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfections, peroxic acid, chlorine and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexid.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity from ATS-ComV-2, so people are sensitive to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies of the immuno response to ATS-ComV-2 are available.
Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronaries, especially ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Normally, the owner of the virus first recognizes the congenital immune system by means of sample receptors (PRDs), including letine C-Tip receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus causes an exposure to ignition factors, the development of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of types I interferons, which curb the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagcycosis of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.
However, with the N-Bible, ATS-ComV may avoid immune reactions.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
The CD4+ T cells encourage the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and the CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
The helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytocks that help protective cells.
However, the Coravirus can inhibit the functions of the T-keys by causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating the virus infection.
For example, antibodys removed from a cure neutralized MERS-ComV.
On the other hand, hyperreaction of the immune system results in a large number of free radicals localized, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario will lead to poly-organism and even death.
The ATS-ComV-2 infection, characterized by cluster exposure, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathology and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have been infected with an immune system.
According to a survey of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhanan, the calculated average incubation period of ATS-ComV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with a difference of 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the study, based on demographic data, 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2 days).
For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the time frames of quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculation of the duration of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease from becoming impermissible.
The common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or were infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be either the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, pain in muscles, headaches, headaches, throat pain, frost, chest pain, diarrhea, tortoise and rudder.
Some patients had a breathing and (or) hypoxia a week after the beginning of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolaidosis and coaagpathia.
High - temperature patient (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus to be performed early in diagnosis even if there is no pathology in the chest.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent clothing and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results have been derived from two recent studies of cases of contamination in the family and the transmission of the virus from unimprovised infections.
Similar results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-ComV, whose main symptoms were also high (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and clothing (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial light ventilation, which was much higher than those with COVID-19, and represented a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.
patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of ATS patients are high temperatures (99-100 per cent), dry cough (29-75 per cent), clothing (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and throat pain (13-25 per cent) and artificial lung ventilation required 14-20 per cent of patients.
As at 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
Compared with this mortality rate from ATS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study carried out in June 2012 showed that 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed deaths were recorded.
As a result of a more early study, the basic reproductive rate (R0) for ATS-ComV-2 was determined at 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23 while R0 for ATS-ComV was between 2 and 4.
A comparison of ATS-ComV-2 with MARS-ComV and CARA-ComV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher capacity of ATS-ComV-2 to disseminate compared to MERS-ComV and ATS-ComV, but the mortality rate for infection with the new virus is lower than the two last.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the ATS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-ComV epidemic and the ATS-ComV epidemic.
A classic phenomenon often occurs in an infection within a family or group of people gathered together for any reason or in any transport together, such as in a cruise lamp.
Patients were often visited by Uhan or by other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or the sick during the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be carrying a virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been cured may be again infected with the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white cells (especially lymphocytes) in their peripheric blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have had lymph nodes with a level of " 4x109/L, including the level of white cells < 1x109/L, as well as an increase in the levels of tarparagine-aminotransfenzia and virus.
Some patients have found higher levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and mioglobin, and most patients have higher levels of C protein and red blood erythr cells.
The level of D-Dimer, blood - inflammation of fibrin, has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily reduced.
Most COVID-19 patients have found pathology with uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses of the “mat glass” type in light when X-rays were screened.
Patients often develop amenical pneumatics, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ORZ).
In the development of uncontrolled combustion, the accumulation of liquids and the progressive fibrosis lead to a significant tear in the gas exchange.
The distillation of type I and II pneumocycites reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung drop.
Thus, the worst results of X-rays often coincide with the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that pneumatics, gylene membrane formation and intertactal lymphatic infiltration, and multiple synthetic cells in light patients who died of disease correspond to pathology of viral infection and PRS and similar to those found in patients with ATS and MERS.
The main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection of RAS-CoV-2 by polymemic chain reaction with reverse transscription (PCR).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the epidemic ' s development, on 13 February 2020, a diagnosis was initiated in China on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on the PCR with reverse transcrosis).
A similar situation was the diagnosis of ATS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis it is critical and it is necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray research.
On 14 February 2020, a panel of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of CHERLOCK, based on the repeat CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-ComV-2; this method allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of the RARS-CoV-2 RNA with a density of 20 × 10-18 moles/l to 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of reference) using trace strips for less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, may greatly enhance the sensitivity and convenience of tests.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronary, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 with only supporting therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or offered in treating other coronaries, such as ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viruses (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, users of immunity, steroids, plasma for cures, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma for cured patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are hastening to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-ComV-2, an attack is mostly easy, and perhaps less striking is the use of other authorities expressing ACE2, such as the stomach-to-cycle tract and kidney.
However, the disruption of work and the refusal of breathing authorities are a major threat and cause the death of patients.
Support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, thus critical to ease symptoms and save lives, is therefore critical, depending on the severity of the disease.
Support is needed to patients with severe respiratory symptoms in the form of extra-corporational membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extra-pullmonal hemorrhaging method used to treat life-suspensive heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of wet-sal balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organs are essential to patients with ATS-ComV-2.
The cytotoxic storm is known to be the result of hyperresponsibility of the immune system for patients infected with ATS and MERS virus.
Cytotoxic storm is the form of a system-wide inflammatory process, developing in response to the release of a series of cytoxins, including TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFNF, ICP-1.
These cytonics are causing immunocy cells to release a huge number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of PRS and poly-organ failure.
The suppression of immunity is crucial when treating cytoxin stormes, especially those in difficult condition, when treating cytoxin stormes.
The treatment of cytoxin storm was followed by corticosoids and tociliosis, monogenic antibodies used as inhibitor of interleucine-6.
Other treatments for cytoxin storm based on the suppression of immunity include the immune response module to control T cells; the IFN-, IL-1 cap on cytoxin, and TNF; the suppression of the oena-quinas; the use of blintumab, cyclintic detectors and hystones' inhibitors.
steroids as suppliers of immunity are widely used to reduce the impact of inflammation in the treatment of ATS viruses.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in treating severe lung damage to patients with ATS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avasconecrocrosis, which significantly reduce the forecast.
However, short-term courses in small and medium-sized doses are recommended for application with caution when treating patients with CVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there was no proven effective antiretroviral therapy.
However, intravenous introduction of a remeducator, nucleotide analog, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remeder is a newly developed anti-virus drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, the Remeder also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with a single click RNA, including those of MERS and CARS.
Based on this data, Gilead provided this Chinese medical team to carry out couples studies on ATS-ComV-2 patients and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitin, ?-interferon, nypivir/retowire and fisher were offered as options for treating patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment using a pilot/retowire may be accompanied by diarrhea, tonal, rudder, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medications assigned to patients should be followed with caution.
Plasma of cured patients and antitel development
Blood collection for patients who have been cured for treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of a healthy population has been in use for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of cured patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to control pathogens.
The antibodies are found in the immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to control pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and neutralize them.
On the basis of this condition, plasma was provided from blood samples of a group of patients who were cured of COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
During the 24 - hour period, their symptoms improved, their inflammation rate reduced, their viral load reduced, and their oxygen - based blood intake increased.
However, to suggest that this method should be used in a massive way prior to the conduct of specific therapy, it is still necessary to ensure that no test or explanations have been made.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma use should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can oversimplify the immune system and cause cytoxide syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for treatment in critical condition is essential.
It's not easy to design and run specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to identify the B cells of cured patients and to define the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screen effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move on to mass antitel production.
The Chinese used traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases for the millenniums.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, which differ depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or undetermined, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
At present, owing to the lack of effective specific therapy, COVID-19 traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the major alternative methods of treating patients with a slight and moderate degree of severity or for patients who are treated after a serious illness.
For example, the pods Shu Feng Dou (Shu Feng Ji Du) and the Lian Hua Qin Ween pods (Lian Hau Qing Ween) were found to be effective in treating CVID19.
The largest proportion of curable patients from COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87 per cent of patients, including in Gansu (63.7 per cent), Nina (50 per cent) and Hunnan (50 per cent), while in Hubey province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used only about 30 per cent of those treated with COVID-19, the lowest percentage of survivors (13 per cent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, since the evaluation must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study that compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing the body temperature, correcting symptoms and providing hospital care was significantly lower for patients who had a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who have begun to suffer from symptoms (from low to poor condition) was markedly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared with 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared with 39%).
However, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more detailed monitoring of research on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, whenever possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 are mainly afraid of acute or even deadly disease, while quarantined persons are also exposed to juice, loneliness and extreme anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and coughing, as well as side effects of treatment such as symbiotics, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early in the outbreaks of the ATS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorial inflammation, psychotic symptoms, deviria and even suicideous behaviour.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID 19 epidemic, can increase people ' s concern and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social glue on their families and friends.
Psychological and psychiatric assistance should therefore be provided to patients with COVID 19, persons suspected of or in contact with them, as well as to all the people required by it.
Psychological support should establish multidisciplinary mental health teams, provide clear information on the regular and accurate update of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and plans for treatment, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the transmission chain from infected animals and infected persons to impressionable hosts and are often applied in addition to the anti-virus therapy used to control the epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to create S-Protein vaccines with the aim of developing long-term and high-active antilloys and (or) protection immunity from ATS-ComV.
Living, weakened vaccines from ATS virus have been developed in animal research.
However, prior to clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when applied to older patients, the model of death dose infections and the level of protection against the infection of zoos.
Perhaps the reason for the fact that the ATS virus disappeared 17 years ago is that no new case has been reported since.
At the same time, there continue to be controversial cases and clusters of the disease caused by the MERS virus, which occur in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions by preserving zoo-based sources in the animal habitats of the endemics.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using activated virus, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and parts of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-ComV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires solutions to curb a raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to long periods (on average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and to the dynamic modification of measles.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover progressively without complications.
However, COVID-19, like ATS and MERS, is also linked to the high rate of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model to determine the priority of their interventions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may affect or become associated with the forecast of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting a disease caused by the ATS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive treatment were more likely to have a background disease and complications and were much older than patients who did not need such therapy (an average of 66 years than 51 years old), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for those with COVID-19.
Gender: HIV/AIDS-COV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100 000 v. 0.27/1000,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardium and arrhythmia.
Cardiologic events have also been the main cause of death in ATS patients.
It was reported that ATS-ComV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive cholesterol, which could result in a failure to work in the liver of patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and congenital diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
The deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of the C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or the damage to tissue and is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the current, response to therapy and permanent recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the level of the C protein, the degree of gravity of the disease and the forecast at COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, the results can also be predicted by an increased level of lactatedhydrigenes, antagragin-aminotransfenzia, alanin-aminotransfenosa and cetacinis.
These enzymes are distributed in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and their release occurs when tissue is damaged.
They are, therefore, traditionally marks of heart or liver dispersion.
The main clinical symptoms: X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account in order to predict the results and complications of CVID19 treatment.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are agents of immunity commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since the use of corticostoids was widely used to treat patients with severe forms of ATS, avacular osteoncrosis has developed in many of the survivors, causing life-related disabilities and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the use of steroids to treat patients with COVID-19 should be given in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the climate of the COVID19 epidemic, many patients are suffering from unforeseen and severe stress because they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to alleviate the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life, they must be treated with psychological counselling and long-term support.
The present demographic studies show that the COVID19 epidemic appears to differ from the ATS epidemic.
In addition to the recyclification in the lower respiratory pathways, the ATS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary diseases causing conventional cold diseases, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory pathway and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of illness or who have not yet completed the incubation period may spread the virus to a considerable extent in the course of their normal life, thus making epidemiological control very difficult.
However, it was considered that the ATS-ComV virus was transmitted when patients were very ill, with the majority of cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID 19 epidemic is far more serious than the ATS epidemic and is more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to declare universal quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend the quarantine regime to virtually the whole population, which has been introduced to halt the spread of the ATS-COV-2 virus.
While these measures are extremely damaging to the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients detected is declining, which indicates a slow pace of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates of the outbreak of illness will end in March, and the period of inflammation will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) said with colleagues that the CVID-19 outbreak, which seemed much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the ATS-ComV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world ' s population.
The Canadian Team of Specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nose and throat masks taken from patients who had been cured and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current policies may have had an impact.
An initial forecast of Ebola was to strike up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to be controlled.
There is a likelihood that like the ATS-ComV virus, the infectious capacity of the ATS-COV-2 virus may weaken, and it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that exists with a human being over time.
The following is a comparison of the COVID19 epidemic with the ATS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The ATS-ComV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or rolling, and may also by direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the calibre, which means that an oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues or even outsiders who have contact with patients or persons infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks, and PN95 (No. 1860s), help control the spread of viruses.
Chemical masks do not allow microplasms of liquids to blow into the air and land on the surface from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (No. 1860s) can protect against breath of virulents ranging from 10 to 80 nm, only pass 5 per cent of virones; ATS-ComV-2 is the same size as ATS-ComV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks placed together, medical personnel directly associated with patients must wear N95 masks (No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a protective robe in order to reduce further contact with viruses.
Diseases can also get into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted ATS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a mask of Class N95; perhaps the virus was in his body through his eyes inflamed.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent fronts or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to usually wash hands with disinfectable funds, try not to leave the house in an isolated manner, and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the ATS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to mankind, the high degree of its similarities with ATS-ComV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have been an alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
It was not until 19 January 2020, however, that the director of the Uhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens by reporting that the new virus had low identity and limited reproductive productivity when transferred from person to person, and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Chinese New Year ' s celebration, and a critical time has been lost when the disease could be held back within the scope of the U.S. Minimum Loss.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example: (1) to make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) to monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than to wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) to take stronger measures to deter the potential epidemic at an early stage of its development rather than to help the public; and (4) to conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly verify and improve public response.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored coronation of the second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-ComV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread to all China, and at the time of writing, it had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronary severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-ComV) and the CVID 19 symptoms are similar to those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in the outbreak of COVID19, a sense of recidivism of ATS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and ATS that are relevant to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 struck older people more than young people and men than women; the proportion of serious cases and deaths among older persons was also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate as a result of ATS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared with 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 distribute the virus even if the disease is non-simplified, whereas ATS patients are usually infected only in serious cases, so it is more difficult to control the spread of CVID-19 than ATS.
This partly explains why SARS-ComV-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-ComV.
Some of the patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal trials of having RNAs-CoV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive samples for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spread of the virus.
In the face of this rapid progression of COVID-19 studies, some critical issues remain to be addressed:
What is the origin of the ATS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologian between ATS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like flying mice, we still cannot argue that the infection of ATS-CoV-2 has happened from flying mice.
What kind of animal became the intermediate species that passed the virus from the original host, such as flying mice, to a human being?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission, and the epidemiological environment can increase at any time.
Modeling at the molecular level and biochemical samples showed that ATS-ComV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how does the virus develop into respiratory cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure that diagnosis and effective treatment are administered quickly and accurately.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve during the human-to-human transmission process?
Will it be the cause of the world pandemic, or will it also disappear like ATS, or will it periodically recalibrate like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but the search for answers to these and many other questions will take time.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Zoon’s Origin of Man’s Quarvirus
The mutation and adaptation have encouraged the co-revolution of the Crowns (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human caravirus (HCV) cause a slight disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life - threatening a coronation can be.
The emergence of a second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-ComV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 brought renewed attention to the coronary virus and surprised us with high transmission, but a weaker pathogenity of the virus compared with the related ATS-ComV virus.
A person’s coronary infection is zoosis, and an understanding of his or her zoo-based origin will be very helpful.
Most of the coroners of man come from flying mice, for which they are not pathogens.
Interim reservoirs of some human ships are also known.
The definition of animal bearers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of the animals that carry the Caravirus can also shed light on the pathogens of the Caravirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on the seven human kingdoms, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as on their zoonic origin and ways of inter-species.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaries in terms of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, consideration is also given to today's epidemic of diseases caused by the coronary disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19).
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful replacement of wearers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
The Crowns refer to the Coronavule family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polarity of the RNA.
These viruses, with the largest number of RNAs containing the virus with a gene ranging from 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when examined by an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
From the point of view of structure, the Caravirus contain unsegged genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open, partially overlapping read-out frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are broadcast into polypropropoenas of pp1a and pp1b.
These polyproteins are further recycled to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked by nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including broad-based protein (S), shelling (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines also code a number of linear axcissor proteins.
On the basis of differences in protein sequences, the radicals are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltaoviral), with the type of beakroviride consisting of the majority of human carvirals and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that most of the alpha- and bactarovirals are volatile mice and hyssin, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltaruvirides.
For thousands of years, coronary lines have been constantly overcome by interspecies, some of which have evolved to human hazards.
So far, seven human kings have been known.
These include the human alpha-alternatives HComV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beatho-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronary of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the curvature of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-ComV) and the coronaralus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type of ATS-CoV-2.
The human roots of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause slight symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
Unlike them, ATS-ComV viruses, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered ATS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogens, causing severe lower respiratory infectious diseases in a relatively larger number of patients with a greater probability of developing acute respiratory disease (PRS) and extra-light symptoms.
The first human transducer of HCV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nooglobules of patients with colds in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a widely accepted concept that human suicide was generally considered harmless.
The SARS flash in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; over 8,000 people have become ill, with a total mortality rate of approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had led to a long-term epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronary in 2019 (2019-nComV), later renamed ATS-CoV-2, is the trigger of the current cancer epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, has claimed more than 3120 lives and more than 91,000 infections have been infected.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the impending SARS-ComV-2 pandemic.
All seven human carniers have zoos and their sources are flying mice, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets have shown that there is an evolutionary nature of all human coronaries from flying mice, whose viruses have been well adapted to organisms and where pathogens do not manifest themselves, but demonstrate broad genetic diversity.
The COVID19 epidemic left China and the world a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zoonic structure of origin of human kings will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors limiting their inter-species.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a container, intermediate and amplifying SARS-ComV-2, which is important for preventing the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on the zoo-based origin, inter-species and pathogenes of human coronaria.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general features: the underlying viruses from which human coronaries have occurred are not usually pathogenic to their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after inter-species transmission to the new bear.
We are also looking at the evolution of human corrosion, according to which the increase in transfer is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogens.
In the same context, consideration is also given to the outcome of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak.
Animals have been known for corals since the late 1930s.
Before the HCV-229E strain was first obtained from the stamma of the HCV-229E segregated from the cold patients, various carnivores were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
During the past decades, seven human kingdoms have been identified.
Table 1 provides an informative and clear summary of the history of the discovery of human caravirs in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCOV-229E virus was obtained from samples from respiratory pathways of patients with infectious outbreaks of upper respiratory pathways in 1966; the virus was then adapted to reproduction in the light cells WI-38.
Patients with the HCV-229E virus displayed cold symptoms, including headaches, scurvy, general infirmity and throat pain, while high temperatures and coughing occurred in between 10 and 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was removed from an organic culture and a subsequent serial hersage in the congenital brain.
Clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to those of the HCV-229E virus, whose symptoms are unique to other pathogens, such as the A flu virus and the cinviral virus.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are widespread in the world and are generally transmitted in winter to moderate latitudes.
The two viruses are mostly for less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks.
According to a study on volunteers, normal colds developed in healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity had a severe lower respiratory infection.
The ATS outbreak, also known as the “eptic pneumonia epidemic”, was the first in all human history of a well-documented pandemic caused by the coronary human being, and the cause of the disease was the ATS-CoV virus, the third of which was detected by the human coronar virus.
The first case of ATS was detected in late 2002 in Guandun Province of China.
During the ATS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented, and disease spread in many countries and on different continents.
Without the use of super-active distributors, it was estimated that each patient could be infected with approximately two more persons; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the virus peak was 10 days.
Patients living with ATS-ComV initially had muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general infirmity and osteoporosis, and later symptoms had a breathing, cough and breathing deficiency.
The widespread deviations of laboratory indicators from the ATS standard are lymphopsis, liver problems and higher levels of cytinosis.
People with ATS also have differential alveolar damage, epithelial cell leachate and macrophage rise.
About 20-30 per cent of patients later need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such grave cases,\ In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, other authorities may be infected, including the stomach-to-feeding system, liver and kidney, which is usually accompanied by cytoxin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus had been removed from the open biopsy of a patient's light relative who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been directed towards research into human caraviruses.
At the end of 2004, HComV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that he was primarily striking young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by the HCV-NL63 is characterized by patterns such as fog, market, high temperature and broncholite.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
According to estimates, HCov-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of the widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases caused by them is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to a structural laringitate, which is also called corruption.
HCV-HKU1 was allocated to Hong Kong in the same year to a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumony and armoured.
In addition to non-free pneumonia and arbitronics, HCV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthma.
Like HComV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCV-HKU virus, which is a respiratory disease, has been detected around the world.
All these four cardiovascular infections were well adapted to people, and their mutations, which have led to high-pathogenic diseases, are generally unlikely, although incidents have not been known for their causes as a rare case with a more virulent substance of HoComV-NL63, which is reported recently to have caused a serious infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, the acquired capacity to be effectively transferred and preserved in the human body, these human coronations become less virulent or pathogens.
For the first time, the CPRS-ComV was allocated in 2012 to the lung of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Most of the laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been reports of incriminating cases and the spread of epidemic secondary infections in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remind us of the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also experienced acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaries passing to the person.
More than 30 per cent of patients have stomach-to-cycle symptoms, such as diarrhoea and rabble.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high mortality in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%) were recorded, so MERS-ComV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to the end of December 2019, classes of patients with pneumonia were identified in Hubey, Hubey Province, Uhan, and are now associated with the infection caused by the second type of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-ComV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by ATS-ComV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself is called “corviral infection 19” (CIID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were reported worldwide, with an estimated 3.4 per cent mortality rate.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubeei is 4.2 per cent and that outside it is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-ComV-2, like the ATS and MERS coronaries, is causing a severe respiratory infection characterized by temperature, cough and obscenity.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pompenia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly develop acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of ATS-COV and ATS-COV-2, given the high homologia of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of phylogenetic wood.
CARS-ComV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a greater transfer capacity than ATS-ComV and MERS-ComV.
Cases of CARS-Commeth infection have been recorded, indicating that the virus is rapidly spreading around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons between ATS-ComV-2 and the six other human kingdoms reveal important similarities and differences.
First of all, the trans-shipments have a similar incubation period and a long flow of diseases caused by them.
In this regard, ATS-ComV-2 shows the same trend as the remaining six human caravires.
Secondly, with the severity of the COVID19 symptoms, it is located between ATS-ComV and four human coroners causing extra-curricular infections (i.e., HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the occurrence of ATS-ComV-2 is similar to that observed most often in the infection of human coronary diseases, including non-specific infections, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with ATS-ComV infections, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, there are also interesting patterns in the transmission of ATS-ComV-2, which are characteristic of both the human coroners responsible for non-temporal infections and the ATS-ComV.
On the one hand, the transferability of ATS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human caraviers causing extra-free infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be verified whether the transmission rate of ATS-ComV-2 with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the case of ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronary diseases, ATS-CoV-2 can be found in kala samples.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the fecalal-oral route of ATS-ComV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances), as in the case of ATS-ComV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of ATS-ComV-2, which is characteristic of human caravires of non-temporal infections.
Nevertheless, future development of the continued COVID-19 would depend on the characteristics of ATS-ComV-2, including transferability, pathogens and sustainable proliferation after transition.
All four human carnivorous cancers with light - shaped symptoms were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that these people have been well adapted to these four human kings.
In other words, both of them could be described as the only relief after the pandemic of human coronaries in the past.
The human coronary diseases that cause serious disease in humans and those who have severe diseases simply did not survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronaries must be reproducible in the human body to a sufficient extent to accumulate adaptive mutations that are countering the limitations of the wearer.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-ComV-2 flash will continue and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus will be fully adapted to the person.
If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other control activities of infectious diseases.
For many years, four out-of-the-blank coronations have been circulating among the population, causing a common cold for people with sound immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservatory.
The high-pricot crowns of CARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not adapted well enough, and their transmission to people cannot be maintained.
They need to stay and multiply in their zoo-rich reservoirs and look for vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing bearers.
SARS-ComV-2 has features similar to ATS-ComV/MERS-ComV and the four HComV free-standing viruses.
It's very easy to pass on, like, off-the-board HoComV, at least now.
But it's more pathogens than the extra-liberal HoComV and less pathogenic than SARS-ComV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to a human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of the HComV virus, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reservoir bearers of the HComV virus.
The animal is an evolutionary HComV wearer if it carries the progeny with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and nonpatogen is present in this medium.
Similarly, the reservatory wearer is constantly transporting the HCV over a long time.
In both cases, the wearers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of the HCV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCV was only caught in an intermediate wearer right in front of or around the time it was seen by a man, it wasn't well adapted to a new wearer and often pathogen.
This intermediate bear can serve as a zoonic source of human infection and as an reinforcing medium, enabling the virus to be reduced to the extent of human contamination.
The HCV can overcome the impasse if it is unable to withstand the transmission within the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, the HCV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate medium and even set a long-term endometicity.
In this case, the intermediate bear becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that the zero ATS patient had contact with hunting animals (child).
Further studies of sero-relevances have shown that animal dealers have an IggG prevalence to the ATS-ComV virus higher than the population as a whole.
The Himalaya cyrates (Paguma lavata) and the venous dog in living animal markets became the first established virus bearers, like almost identical ATS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the cythetics in markets, the ATS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cités living in nature or on farms that did not enter markets in most cases had not been determined, leading to the conclusion that the Himalayan citadels could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing medium rather than a natural SARS-ComV tank.
Interestingly, since 80 per cent of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to ATS-ComV, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that multiple small mammals may also serve as intermediate reinforcing bears.
They all appear to be the SARS-ComV negotiators.
The next discovery of the natural animal bear, CARS-ComV, revealed a near-gent CV of flying mice, called the aetopic pneur's coroner's crown-incision of HKU3 flying mice (SARSr-Rh-BatComV HKU3) which is present in China's pancreatic flying mice.
These muscles are positive to ATS-CoV and ATS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genetic sequence.
These and other flying mice have 88-92% the same gymology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-ComV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that flying mice have become the masters of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like crowns (SL-ComV) have also been detected in flying mice, but none of them, except one that stands for WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-ComV receptor is the human angiotensin-convergence enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was pointed out that WIV1 derived from a sample of fecal flying mice used ACE2 flying mice, cythet and man as receptor for entering the cage.
Interestingly, serums of leaching patients with ATS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is represented by the most closely related ancestor of SARS-ComV in flying mice, sharing 95 per cent of the gymology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homologia between these two viruses, it is generally felt that WIV1 is not a direct parental virus of ATS-CoV, and that flying mice are not a direct SARS-ComV reservoir.
Philogenetic analysis includes MERS-ComV in the same group as CV-HKU4 flying mice and CV-HKU5 flying mice.
CV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-ComV use the same wearer receptor, diptyldipedipropidide (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent SRN-POC-POV sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are closer phylogenetically to those of the bioacroviral mice identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild flying mice have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 flying mice coincided by only 87%.
So the flying mouse might not have been the direct reservoir of the MERS-ComV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that single-bar camels are serialized to neutral antibody specific to MERS-ComV as well as Middle-East camels in many African countries.
The living MERS-ComV, identical to the human virus, has been removed from the nasal strokes of single-breed camels, which further confirms the role of camels as the true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels, experimentally infected with MERS-ComV, have experienced minor symptoms but massive viruses.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have isolated the virus not only by respiratory means but also by phecalal-oral means, which is also the main way of allocating the virus to flying mice.
Questions remain, however, as many confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome cases have not been associated with camels in amnesnee before symptoms arise and are appropriately related to human transmission or transfer of unknown channels, including unknown animal species, which are MERS-CoV carriers.
The gymology of nucleotides SARS-ComV-2 on 96.2 per cent coincides with the CV RaTG13 flying mice allocated to the Asian pallets of Richolophus affinis.
As in the case of ATS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the disversibility of the sequences between ATS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
So the flying mice could not have been the direct tank bearer of ATS-CoV-2 unless almost identical crowns of volatile mice were found in the future.
The direct animal inhabitants of the ATS-CoV-2 virus are expected to be among the wild species sold and killed in the Huan's seafood market, which has been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates that there is likely to be a transfer from the animal to the animal.
A number of recent studies based on metagenonomic sequence have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals known as the Pangolina (Manis javainaca) could also carry the parent beetoravirus, the father of the SARS-COV-2 strain.
The homology of nucleotide sequences of these new denomines of the pangolins is 85-92% the same as ATS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence level about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two areas of differentiation of viruses such as ATS-CoV-2 in the phyloginic tree, one of which has a receptor-linking domain (RSD) closer to ATS-CoV-2, with an identical amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the ATS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more developed, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
A more early study of the panoglyn patients also reported on the definition of vibrating contagions in the lungs, which were thus related to ATS-ComV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to achieve the genetic sequence, which includes about 86.3 per cent of the full-time virus genome.
It cannot be excluded that the pangolin was one of the intermediate breeders of ATS-ComV-2.
However, as a result of the disversification of the sequences between ATS-CoV-2 and the bioacrovirals of Pangolins related to ATS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct origin of ATS-CoV-2 from the Pangolin.
In addition, the distance between ATS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than SARS-ComV-2 and the pangolins ' bioatones associated with ATS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of ATS-CoV-2 is yet to be established in flying mice, lodgings and other mammals.
While the highest hemology of sequences was found in the MSD between the ATS-CoV-2 and the pangolin Beakrovirals, related SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest hemology of sequences throughout the gene.
Very theoretically, a high degree of image between the pangolin Beakrovirals of the SARS-ComV-2, and SARS-ComV-2 is related to the parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposing proposal is in favour of a recombination between the Beakroviride of the Pangolins, the native SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widespread among the Beakaruvirals.
There is still no final decision on the direct ozone origin of the ATS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-pathogenic HComV viruses, studies are also carried out on the zoo-based origin of HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1.
Philogenetic evidence shows that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from volatile mice, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in the Gregorics.
It has been reported that the caravir of flying mice called APCV.2 (Aplachian Ridge CV) and identified by the North American tri-colored hers, has shown a close kinship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E is genetically linked to the other coral of volatile mice called Hipposderos/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate bow might have been camels.
To be clear, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known Caravirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The philogenetic analysis provided proof of the events of the HComV inter-species in anamne.
When the HComV-OC43 virus was inter-species about 1890 and people were infected with pets, a respiratory pandemic was registered.
The history of the inter-species HComV-229E is not so clear.
The alpha-corpions of volatile mice close to the HCV-229E were discovered.
There's an alpha-corviral between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to a human.
First, it was people, rather than the alpines, who were able to communicate with flying mice in the overall environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alps.
Second, the alpha-corrurals of volatile mice, the related HComV-229E, and the flying mice are varied and non-patogenes, while the alphacornosis of the alpaqui caused a respiratory disease to occur in infected animals.
Finally, the alphacorn virus of the Alps was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alpines have been given alpha-corruption, the family HCV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are the direct source of pathogens of human viruses, including the virus of besiege, the Ebola virus, the Nippa virus and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that flying mice could have passed HCV-229E directly to people.
On the other hand, while alpha-corviral mice may have served as a rock bullet for the HCV-229E virus, alpasques and single camels could be intermediate carriers who would transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of the MERS-ComV virus.
MERS-ComV provides an excellent example of interspecies between flying mice with single camels and single camels.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-ComV virus from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that flying mice provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies and inter-species.
Long-range, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make flying mice “the ideal proliferators”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by the single camels a decade ago.
He was well adapted to these camels, which became a stable and natural reservoir.
These animals have the MERS-ComV virus, which causes very light disease and is characterized by relatively low mutation frequency.
His epidomeal handover is an accident, and the human being remains an impasse on the MERS-CoV because his transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-ComV, the role of the Mongols, if any, in the transmission of the ATS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the pangoalals ' bioaquatics are highly permeable to the Pangolins.
They can be negotiators of the Betacrovirus, the SARS-CoV-2, as well as cyrates in the case of ATS-ComV.
In future studies it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities for inter-species of the ATS-ComV-2 virus from the animal.
First, the flying mouse may be a reservoir for a virus, related ATS-ComV-2, almost identical with ATS-ComV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with flying mice by carbon dioxide or by cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, applications may be one of the intermediate reinforcing mediums where the related ATS-CoV-2 virus recently fell.
People are infected with the virus through carcases and by eating wild animals.
Many animals, including domestic animals, are likely to be exposed to ATS-ComV-2.
An antibody survey of domestic and wild animals is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of ATS-ComV-2 could take place in a third form, which had contact with both flying muscles and pangoons.
The search for animal origin is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal species, the three main factors on the basis of viruses have also contributed to the cross-section of the interveal barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA reproduction.
Compared to other viruses with the one-stop RNA, the calculated frequency of coronary mutations can be considered to be “measure-high” with the average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutes per year at one site 2 depending on the response phase to new owners.
Roots have a adjusted exorbitonuclease, whose removal results in an extremely high frequency of mutationity and weakness or even insatisfaction.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdezir suppresses the reproduction of caraviruss through the incorporation of the exorbitonucelas and the RNC-dependent RNA-Polimos.
Remedivator is one of the most promising means against ATS-ComV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations is nearly a million times higher than their bearers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if they are not well adapted to the wearer.
Compared to ATS-ComV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of ATS-CoV-2 mutations is seen below, indicating a higher level of adaptation.
This virus is supposed to have been adapted to another nose close to a person.
In addition to SARS-ComV-2, this also applies to MERS-ComV, well adapted to single camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from ATS-ComV-2 will quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA gene in the coroneria results in more genetic modification with regard to mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of inter-spective formation favourable to the emergence of new caravirus where appropriate.
This is supported by the many unique open-ended reading and protein functions that have been coded in the direction of the 3-point genome.
Third, through a unique matrix selection mechanism, the coronaries are accidental and often switch matrices during the re-recipline of RNA.
During the transscription of the DNA of a carvirus in a bear that serves as a mixing vessel, the neutium is often switched on.
High-chemical, full-scale and sub-generic RNAs can recombin and create new caraviruses.
The philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animals such as SL-CoV and BatCoV-HKU9 volatile mice.
Impact of the virus on transmission
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, another key factor essential for inter-velocity transmission is the interaction of the virus with the wearer receptor.
This article, as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-species, provides a recombination of ATS-ComV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-ComV strains of human beings and cyvettes, it is considered that ATS-ComV is undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to RSD protein S mutations.
In general, the RSD of the S coronitrus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the response of the wearer's antibody intensively selects it.
SARS-ComV is amino acids, from 318 to 510, in S1 which, for the introduction of the virus into the cell, links to angiotensin-presumption enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as to its corceptors.
SARS-ComV is capable of recognizing PPF2 receptors of different animals, including the flying mouse, the cyrate, the mouse and the venous dog, making possible inter-spective transmission of the virus.
In fact, the RSD has found only 6 amino acid residues that differ from human and citetta viruses, 4 of which are in receptor-linked motivation for interaction with the APF receptor.
The SARS-ComV cyvettes have K479N and S487T mutations in the SRD, which can increase the relativeness of the interaction between the bar and the human receptor of the APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids may be particularly important for adapting the virus to a person.
It is worth noting that ATS-ComV-2 has the same cell receptor as ATS-ComV.
The difference of 30 per cent between ATS-ComV-2 and ATS-ComV in segment S1 of the S1 protein results in a change in the relationship of the S protein to the human APF2.
Indeed, a microelectronic microscopic study says that this is 10-20 times higher than that between APF2 and BS of SARS-ComV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreptics were needed for the transfer of ATS-ComV-2.
It is amazing that HCov-NL63 is also connected to APF2, but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as an aminopedide N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acethylylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coroners in humans after inter-species from animals.
In addition to receptors, the results of the HCV inter-species are also managed by other factors of dependency and restriction of the wearer.
Divergence of these proteins between humans and the natural reservoirs of HCOVs, such as flying mice, single camels and mushrooms, may constitute a barrier to inter-species.
For successful inter-species, the HCOV virus has to absorb the dependency factors and manage the retractors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the wearer still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in impartial full-time screening of dependency factors and vehicle resuscitations for ATS-ComV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
New GCV origin: back to zero mark
The variety of corals of volatile mice provides a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of new HCV.
In this sense, bats are a genetic pool for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving forces for the evolution of HCOV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that code proteins has the potential to radically alter the phenotypes of viruses.
The Accesor proteins of ATS-ComV are considered important for adaptation to people because the viruses of flying mice, the related ATS-ComV, have been isolated but found to code the orF8 diagnostic proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide delegation characterised by the SARS-ComV cruisers was discovered.
This delegation splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates wear change.
In addition, CARS-ComV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-testing lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-Polite.
The localization of recombination was also identified in non-structured proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemiological MERS-ComV was subjected to recyclable events between different lines, which occurred on single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-ComV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events also occurred in other HCV, where HCV was recombined with other animals in its non-structured genes.
It must also be warned that artificial isolation can cause unintended changes in viral genomes, which is likely to be the result of ridding the virus of the electrification pressures, such as on the part of the immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-time ORF4 in a prototype HCOV-229E strain due to a two-way delegation.
While the intact open border of the reading of ORF4 can be seen in the viruses of the bat and camel, which are associated with the HoCV-229E, the alphacornides show a single-nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the box.
Finally, the evolution of the new GCV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
There were weakly expressed symptoms or lack of these symptoms when volatile mice were infected, indicating a mutual adaptation between coronary and volatile mice.
It turns out that the flying muscles are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the coronary.
For example, the inflammatory response defects in the flying mice effectively reduce pathology caused by the Caravirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in volatile mice has been suppressed by the abuse of the inhibitor receptor of the natural killer cells of NKG2/CD94 and the low exposing of the molecules of the first class I histocomplience.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is produced by the high oxygen activity of volatile mice, can suppress the reproduction of the coronary, while at the same time affecting the exorbitonucleis, thus exerting pressure on the selection to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new vehicle.
More pathogenic strains of the coroner can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the wearer.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new kingdoms have emerged over the past 20 years.
The roots are nonpatogen, or they cause light symptoms from their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They are confidently repatriated without causing a strong immune response from the wearer.
This is a secret to why we see unimproved bearers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Heavy symptoms are primarily associated with the hyperactivity of the immune response and cytonic storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pain of the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response of the impressionless bearers does not involve the reproduction of the Caravirus.
The same strategy for non-immune response may have a positive effect in therapy against ATS-ComV-2.
The fly mice have a particularly large interferon response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interference, at least in the initial phase of the ATS-CoV-2 infection, should have a favourable effect.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammome activation has been violated in volatile mice.
On this basis, the incorporation of NLRP3-inflamamium with MPC950 may prove useful in treating CVID-19.
The emergence of ATS-ComV-2 follows the general scheme by which ATS-ComV and MERS-ComV emerged.
While the bioacroviral of volatile mice has been found, 95% of which is the same as ATS-CoV, there is also the coronary virus of volatile mice, whose nucleotide homology coincides with 96% of SARS-COV-2.
Although citrus and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to ATS-ComV, the direct intermediate wearers for ATS-ComV-2 have not been installed.
Beetarivirals of the Pangolin, remarkably homologous SARS-CoV-2, were detected, indicating that the pangolins could serve as an intermediate bearer or that fragments of the genes of pangolins' beads could enter the final version of ATS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that ATS-COV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
The Crowns have attracted universal attention because of the recent outbreak of ATS-ComV-2.
The study of corals in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoo-based origin and of HCOV animals in human transmission.
The convincing evidence has shown that ATS-ComV, MARS-CoV and CARS-CoV-2 come from flying mice and were passed on to man through intermediate wearers.
If the ATS-ComV infection comes from interaction between people and citats in markets, the closing of children's markets and the destruction of cystrates on them could effectively put an end to the ATS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of lines of pangolin beakrovirals, near-natal ATS-COV-2, it is necessary to remove the pangolins in order to prevent the zoonic transmission of the infection from the food markets.
However, whether ATS-ComV-2 is passed to a person through the panholons and other mammals and how this can be done in future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed on single camels.
The camels provide an important vehicle, as well as the main source of wool meat, milk, skin and articles for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the markets of China's wild animals to prevent the spread of ATS-COV and CARS-CoV-2.
In order to halt the recurring MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach must be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-ComV for camels, coupled with other infectious control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, there may be new genotypes that cause outbreaks of disease.
A wide range of zoos are circulating around the world.
In particular, there is a wide range of coronary mice with zoonostic potential.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonosonic coronaries, which in the future will lead to new caravirs that are easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to man.
In order to reduce contact between humans and animals, a culture of animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests such as those performed by ATS, MERS and COVID19, a better willingness and a plan to respond are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
Although many properties of flying mice are good for spreading viruses, if they are taught to keep people away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of man’s contact with flying mice and other wild animals.
In order to better understand the environment of corals and their natural wearers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of caramines from animal and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoos is to keep people away from the ecological downs of the natural reservoirs of zoonostic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the zoo-based puzzle SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the flying mice were passed on to the ARS-CoV-2 pangoons, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances the flying mice and the leopards share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in handing over a person, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate medium is to be played by a third mammalser, it is necessary to ascertain how it interacts with different species, including human beings, flying mice and pangles.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to ATS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Either a flying mouse, a pangolin or another mammals, it is expected that in the future ATS-CoV-2 or its predecessors will be identified by their natural wearers.
Further research in this area sheds light on the evolutionary path of ATS-CoV-2 animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 among humans.
The diagnostic criteria for “suggested disease” and “verified cases” of COVID 19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronary infection (2019-nComV), which highlights our experience and provides well-tested recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection 2019 (CIID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been constantly updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and bring up the latest diagnostic criteria for “suggested sickness” and “verified cases” in accordance with the Recommendation on diagnostics and therapy for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the DPRK.
In December, 2019, a new coronary virus broke out 2019 (2019-nComV), now officially known as the coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was referred to as the “hard acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-ComV-2).
WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In order to combat the AIDS-ComV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference manual and published it on the website of the Military Medical Research web site on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually enhanced on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been updated continuously.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020 produced seven editions of the Recommendation for Diseases and Medicines for COVID-19, published by the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions has changed significantly.
Recently, comments on our recommendations were made in the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with the sponsors, which contained simple suggestions for diagnostics based on already available clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on the pandemic, which has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Regniques on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (of 3 March 2020), a single element of the epidemiological history with two clinical diseases must be combined in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis, if a disease is to be confirmed:
Epidemiological history: (1) The history of transmission or residence in Uhan and its surroundings or in other places where cases of CVID-19 have been reported within 14 days prior to the symptoms; (2) the history of contact with patients infected with ATS-ComV-2 (with a positive test based on nuclinic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surrounding areas or other human settlements, where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of confirmed diseases (about 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered within 2 weeks on small sites such as home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperatures and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white cells are normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogens or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for ATS-ComV-2; (2) full-time sequence of the virus shows a high incidence of new coronary diseases; (3) the positive results of a serosene for specific IgM-IgM and IgG-specific anti-test; or the change of the result from a negative to a positive for the SARS-COV-2 specific antibody IgG or the increase of a tetra at least four times during the recovery phase of the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) editions of the document, the PCR test was added in real time for nuclein acids in respiratory tracts or blood samples.
The pathological diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020), and then in the seventh issue the need for serologic evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers engaged in the search for the optimum set of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples collected from respiratory paths, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results from testing for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
There is, however, increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with aetocratic symptoms and patients without the symptoms expressed.
Thus, the road map presented at Zhou (Zhou) and others should be updated as it classifies those who do not have clinical symptoms as low-risk groups.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suggested disease” and “verified cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID 19 - day maximum
Yesterday Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths per day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 sick patients who were home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online factory, director of IEDCR Dr. Mirjabi Sabrine Flora told me that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deaths were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two victims were from Dakka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID 19 pandemic.
The clinic staff member informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Mayri Kuwaiti clinic.
On Saturday, on an online tour, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obidoll Kwader, stated that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was suspended on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID19 infections were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March by two persons who had returned from Italy and one of them had a wife.
As at 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-ComV-2 has crossed a million-dollar infection rates around the world
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the coronary infection is more than one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 Corvirus.
The same day, the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and Zambia recorded the first case of death from Caravirus.
North Korea claimed that, as at Thursday, it had been one of the few countries that had not recorded cases of measles infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of contamination, including 79,332 in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 in central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of measles were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths due to a coronary infection were reported on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobin, extended the regime for the isolation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that the Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would be paid up to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote in opposition.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the sacred cities of Makk and Medina for a full day, while the previous curfew lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Deyouin, announced that the state’s home isolation regime had been extended by an order by 1 May.
Australian graves limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian webs of Volworths and Colles reduced the amount of toilet paper packages that could be purchased at once in all shops in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in the announcements on the cashiers, as well as on the Facebook Web site.
Citizens were reportedly starting to make emergency stocks because of the insurance that COVID-19 might lead to a general self-resolvement regime.
On Wednesday, the Voolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number to 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that with the introduction of a restriction on four packages, “in many stores of toilet paper, the purchase is still too fast — one shipment over an hour” and called such demand “unprecedent”, while ALDI in Facebook, published on Tuesday, called this trend ‘unforese”.
The Voolworths said there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's shop in Canberra last week also limited the number to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, the Coles have ordered larger shipments and increased supply frequency, Volworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI has made stocks for a special environmental early sale exercise.
Russell Sharmman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Ritiers, reported that the miners were trying to refill their stocks, but that was hampered by local authorities ' restrictions on the schedule of freight vehicles.
He looked forward to increasing the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to satisfy demand, but less and less offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of depletion of stock, some shops could not operate on the environment.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the Queensland Institute of Technology, told me that shops were refilling stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky product, so the quantity of warehouses was small and that after sale, the entire volume of goods remained empty, increasing the sense of stock shortages.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and products such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelfes in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicked,” says Russell Thimerman.
In a past environment, the manufacturer of the Who Gates a Crapp has reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Corbint stamps, reported that they were working 24 hours a day to provide enough supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when auctions in Melbourne fell due to the lack of buyers during the week of the Labor Day, some real - estate sellers began offering the first auction participants free toilet paper.
The Thursday issue of NT News, printed in Darwin, included a tab of eight pages for cutting and using toilet paper.
According to Australia's ABC of March 3, shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they were not planning to do so.
Russellemerman added that other products also take advantage of increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfecting, galateria, hand washing and torment.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was observed that the British Ocado ' s online supermarket had also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID 19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the COVID-19 infectious disease caused by ATS-ComV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemy” only describes the extent of the disease, rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take measures:
“All countries are still together in a position to influence the course of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor and mobilize their citizens,” explained the WHO Director-General, Mr. Teds Adana Gebreiss.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction”.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said, in his interview with CNN in February, that “no respiratory virus other than flu has yet to be monitored from its inception to the continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gebreiss expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen pandemics caused by the Caravirus.
Nor have we ever seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of this disease of an international public health emergency and then granted it a new status — the pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “It's only beginning, it's going to be worse.
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 CVID-19 cases were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Karavir pandemic 2019-2020 is the current pandemic of the coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronary severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-ComV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million CVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, killing some 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and poor breathing.
Possible complications include pneumatics and acute respiratory disorder.
The time between the first symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it may also vary from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
Basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive; preventive measures recommended include hand washing, mouth covering in cough, human distance, identification and self-resulting of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, job risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the transfer or elimination of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, and the widespread lack of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other nationals of East and South-East Asia, or those who remind them of the virus, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions decreased as a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhana (Khubei capital), China, reported cases of pneumony having an unknown cause and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infections were mainly related to the optical market of Juan’s seafood, so the virus is believed to have a zoonic origin.
The virus that triggered the outbreak of the disease is known as ATS-CoV-2. This is a newly discovered virus that is very similar to that of a flying mouse, the Pangolin coronary and the SARS-ComV virus. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the South China branch of the newspaper Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubaei on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular because of the many cases with poorly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients 19 years of age or younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide; the United Kingdom ' s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the establishment of effective group immunity among the population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested at COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under the official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted requiring that only minor symptoms be avoided.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of the cases of CVID19 were not detected in China and that such unregistered patients had become a source of contamination for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID 19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates a rate of 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are well-equipped.
In other cases, the time between the beginning of the symptoms and the time of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were caused by persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent were related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive CVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested — for example, if they die at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID rate four to five times.
The U.S. Secretary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [an reported number of deaths] are lower than the actual”, his words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States, which often occur in pandemics such as the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009 and the first confirmed death was recorded in Huhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of the disease; they are also influenced by the level of testing, quality of health care systems, treatment schemes used, time from outbreak to outbreak of disease and population values such as age, gender and general health status.
According to statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infections as at 10 April 2020 is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate declined from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the rate of disease-related mortality (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients dying of the disease and the percentage of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the point of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The University of Oxford Evidence Center estimates that the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the results of the first random CVID19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of the CFR evaluation test.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The pic and exact duration of the flash are not defined and may vary according to location.
Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually come out on the plateau, and then, when the number of people present ends, they begin to burn.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will occur.”
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Joong Nanshan, states that “all things can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO's recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that ATS-Cov-2 “will be able to circulate possibly for a year or two”.
According to a study carried out by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (perhaps 18 months or more), physical distance and other measures will be taken.
William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don't think that this coronary will ever disappear at all, because it's so easily transmitted” and that he “can turn into a seasonal disease by every year”.
The virulentness of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may suffer from a disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are elevated temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the respiratory pathways (scission), irritability, clothing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, obsolescence, vomiting, hemorrhagne, diarrhea, or cynicism, WHO claims that it causes about every sixth person serious health problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list such urgent symptoms as the difficulty of breathing, chronic pain or chest inhalation, sudden sense of perceptibility, difficulty in waking up and getting a person or a lips to fall. If these symptoms exist, medical treatment should be sought immediately; further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disorder, sepsis, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected persons may experience a disease unimprovised, without clinical manifestations, but the results confirm the fact that the infection has occurred, and doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients who have been diagnosed be placed under strict control and screening for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that cases of heartless disease vary from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the period between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it usually is five days, until there is no clearness as to the symptoms of the conditioning: the initial estimate of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was originally 30 per cent and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details about the spread of the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as by small droplets entering the air along with the cough, combust or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some open-shell studies, droplets may extend from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during conversation, which may remain in the air for longer periods, and the respirators may also be formed in the air, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intuitation and cardio-leasing (SLR), may lead to the spraying of breathing products and consequently to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if the person concerns the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mercury.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through phecala, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of a phencal-oral transmission of ATS-ComV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of the symptoms, although it may occur before or at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been positive in testing three days before symptoms appear, and this shows the possibility of transmission of the virus to the detected symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of heartless disease, but contacts monitoring studies in some countries have also revealed cases of transmission of the disease from non-simplified wearers.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 others, and that the virus is capable of surviving on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (semipy) and on stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on a potato surface for one day and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with households and other animals receiving a positive result for CVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as after contacting other surfaces that infected people could touch.
The heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-ComV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Huhan.
All the signs of the new ATS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in the cogenal coronary, and the human body can be destroyed with the help of a domestic soap, which dissolves its protective shell. ATS-COV-2 has a great similarities with the underlying ATS-ComV virus.
He's supposed to be of zoonomy origin.
Genetic analysis of the coroner has shown that it is genetically classified with a species of Betacoronavirus, a subspecies of Sarbiovirus (clanline B) together with two other strains of volatile mice.
At the holistic level, it is 96 per cent identical to the other samples of the bat raster (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the gene sequence between the pangolin virus and man.
So far, the cell-genome comparison has shown that the largest percentage (92 per cent) is between the Pangoal Corviral and the SARS-ComV-2, but that's not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it must eventually be verified by testing a polymagnetic chain reaction with reverse transmission (TR-PRC) of the infected secret or computer scan.
A study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhan showed that the CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincided with other pneumatics and disease currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation that “do not use the CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in a CVID-19 diagnostic”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols at CARS-ComV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Polymeoline chain reaction testing is carried out in real-time (PRTR).
It can be performed on respiratory samples and blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a period of from several hours to several days.
The method of testing is to use nozzle brushes, although it can also be used in the glyphs. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serologic tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had proved sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for widespread application.
In the United States, the Celex serologic test was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and Computer CTs include the asymmetrical peripherical mutation of the mathematical glass type and the lack of pleviral rashes.
The Italian Radiological Society is developing an international evidence base for confirmed infections.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenivirus, when identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by the PCR tests have a limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of the CT chest and PCR testing, and it was clarified that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be seen as a screening tool in infected areas.
In order to detect the virus by means of X-rays and computer scantograms, wired neural networks have been developed based on artificial intelligence.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mercury with dirty hands, using coughing or salfacts to be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent transmission, it is also recommended that persons be physically distanced from their families; many Governments recommend that any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by outbreaks be avoided and that the movement of citizens be restricted.
Nevertheless, the virus could spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected; health workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contacting others and protecting their eyes, while monitoring contact is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens by their mobile phones for this purpose raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, made statements calling for a limited monitoring of human beings.
Various voluntary mobile applications have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups had worked to develop decisions to ensure confidentiality of personal data — for example, registration of user proximity to other cell phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test proved to be a positive one, he will receive a notification. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent the infection, such as cutting the nose and the mouth, which is in fact ineffective.
At present, there is no CVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands be washed with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visits to the toilet or when the hands are heavily polluted, and before eating, after wrinkling, coughing or cleaning.
This is necessary because when the virus is outside the human body, it is destroyed by the domestic soap that exposes its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of hand disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis with a alcohol content of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid blindfolding, nose, or mercury with dirty hands.
The surface may be dehydrated by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel, the disinfectant begins to operate a minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropolene, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 - 7.5 per cent of the surface.
Other components, such as ensalcone chloride and glucose chlorhexid, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if suspected of COVD or confirmed in a facility such as office or day-care facilities, all premises such as rooms, toilets, public premises, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensory screens, keyboards, remote controls and bankers used by sick people be exposed to infection.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or cleaning, they cover the mouth and nose of the back of the arm with a elbow or salfet and immediately release the hygiene items used.
It is recommended that those who may have been infected use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and range of disposal products that are scattered in the air during conversation, chai and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffen, a virus specialist at the University of Leeds, “the use of medical masks may reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and exposure to the face of dirty hands is a major method of infection”, and masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person from COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of skin attacks.
Several countries have begun calling for medical masks in public places.
CDC centres, U.S.A., recommend the wearing of non-medical trance masks; China has separately emphasized the importance of using one-time medical masks with healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 m (3 feet) or less) with others.
In Hong Kong it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Thai health officials call on people to manufacture and wipe face-to-face cane masks in their homes every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Vietnamese Government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced since mid-March, medical masks were ordered for all passengers in trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask while leaving the street; it was recommended that people who could not acquire masks should carry them on their own in their own homes.
Medical masks are also widely used by the residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Protection measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home by limiting travel, avoiding people’s places, by taking advantage of endless greetings, and by physically distanced from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those affected by the outbreak, are now prescribed or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place, as recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations, has been reduced rapidly, from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available), to 50, and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two people in groups, elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and weakened immune system, faced increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if there is a outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the aim of this measure is to reduce physical contact through social relations, whether by virtualization or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be totally excluded from social exclusion rather than remain in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some agencies issued guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, only their permanent partners with whom you live have been advised to have sexual relations, and to whom you are confident that there is no virus and its symptoms.
Persons who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are recommended for self-insolvement in the home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-resolvement, and many Governments have also imposed or encouraged all affected populations to place themselves on quarantine.
High-risk individuals have been ordered by the lowest quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with the infected COVID 19 or who have recently visited a country or region affected by a major epidemic have been encouraged to find quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include containing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is intended to track and isolate the infected, including other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease was no longer possible, efforts were being directed towards mitigation: measures were being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of disease can be taken simultaneously.
The spread of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the response to the outbreak of infection is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the alignment of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-restriction; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and the abolition of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection, such as surface cleaning. After the seriousness of the outbreak in China became apparent, stronger action was taken to contain outbreaks such as isolation of cities and severe travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and has also organized a system of notification of the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who had been isolated and who had been fined for those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, medical mask production and fines were increased for the accumulation of excess medicines, and the United Kingdom and the United States have found that there are serious problems with mitigation (a slowdown, but not an end to the epidemic) and suppression (a halt to the epidemic's growth).
An optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the disease can reduce its peak health burden by 2/3 and its mortality rate by twice, but it can still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will soon resume when the measures are weakened.
Long-term interference to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
No anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19 are currently available, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
The use of non-preceptive drugs from colds, the use of enough fluids and rest can help to ease the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, internal fluid introduction and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only hurt.
Several compounds that had been previously approved for other viruses are also being considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some of the “traditional and domestic” symptoms caused by ATS-ComV-19 could be eased.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID 19 as the main response to the outbreak of disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the lifting of non-term procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and isolation of patients with confirmed CVID-19 diagnosis, and the enhancement of intensive therapy through staff training and the increase in the availability of IDP and some.
There are different theories about where the earliest case of infection, the so-called “null patient”.
The first known case of infection with a new coronary infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in Hubay Province, China.
During the month, the number of measles infections in the province of Hubay has increased gradually.
These were mainly related to the optical market of Juann seafood, which also sold live animals, and one theory was that the virus had entered human life from one of these animals; in other words, the virus was of Zoonian origin. On 26 December, a mass disease of unknown pneumony was reported at the Hubei clinic, where a doctor, Zhang Tianzingin, had worked with him on 27 December, reporting to the Centre for Monitoring and Prevention of Tsianhan’s Diseases in the town of Ouhan.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Uhan’s central clinic warned her colleagues of a “SARS-like Coronavirus”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police about responsibility for spreading false rumours, and a doctor, Ai Fen, received a speech from his superiors for raising a panic.
Later, on 31 December, Uhana ' s Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
In the early stages of the outbreaks, Uhana reported the number of reported cases of unknown pneumonia, which was sufficient to trigger an investigation in early January, which doubled the number of cases approximately seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shengzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, there were already 6,174 cases of disease, and as of 26 March the United States had driven China and Italy to the highest levels of confirmed infections worldwide. By 9 April 2020 there were more than 1.61 million cases of infection worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had been cured.
At least one reported case of contamination was recorded in some 200 countries and territories.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Area have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home accommodation, compulsory home closure or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were kept in quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines, about 59 million people were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure had increased to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Huhan on 1 December 2019; another report stated that the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisin’s doctor worked with an unknown type of pneumonia, and on 27 December her clinic notified the Ziankhang Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Ukhan City.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, revealed the presence of ATS-like coronary.
On 31 December, Uhana ' s Municipal Health Commission published a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Huhan of the responsibility for “dissemination of rumours” of the outbreak.
Initially, the China National Health Commission argued that there was no “survivable evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to be transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later called Ci Jinpin, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, as a “people’s war”.
The events of “the most large-scale quarantine in the history of humanity ” began, on 23 January, declared a health border and the ban on entry into Uhan and back, followed by a total of 15 towns in Hubay province and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The city was forbidden to use personal transportation.
Many places have been abolished on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital at Khossenskian, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Laishan, was built, which had received other patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Huhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universitys and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have put in place a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in the province of Hubay and beyond.
The schedule of public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen movement control regime was introduced, and some 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on outdoor traffic, after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been reported in mainland China, which had taken place five days earlier, in this case from the person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Lee Katzen reported that the incidence of internal infections had been largely stopped and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions were lifted in Huby, except Uhana, two months after the closure of the province to quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with visa or residence permits had been suspended since 28 March, and the exact dates for the termination of the order had not been called.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consuls.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their jobs and provided companies with cash incentives packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the Caravirus, which was announced by the Council of State and associated with the Festival of Quinmín, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, respecting physical distance to avoid a recurrence of CVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhonji.
The followers of Shinchongji arrived in Tega from Uhana, which is believed to be a source of outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported having symptoms. The highest level of anxiety was declared in South Korea on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and on 29 February this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after the three soldiers had confirmed the virus.
The accident affected the number of journeys, so the airline flight schedule was changed, and South Korea launched a programme for screening populations for the virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contactees, which is considered to be the largest and best known in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile applications by all those coming from abroad, criminal testing for the virus, the results of which were ready for the next day, and the enhancement of testing capabilities, allowing for up to 20,000 testing every day.
South Korea ' s programme was considered successful in the fight against the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities had not been isolated, and the South Korean society had initially been divided by the response of President Mun Zhae In to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon Impipment for inadequate, in their view, the Government's response to the outbreak of illness.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in one day for four weeks.

The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have had positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison leadership to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful indemnification, as well as temporarily to release all prisoners belonging to this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths within one day, the largest number of deaths reported in the country since the outbreak of the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, Iran had recorded 50 new cases every hour and every ten minutes, one new death from the coronary virus.
According to the representative of WHO, the morbidity rate in Iran could be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the alleviation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had occurred in Italy when two Chinese tourists had tests at ATS-ComV-2, which had been successful in Rome.

A non-associated cluster of cases of COVID 19 was later detected, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new Decree-Contract Control Act, which provides that more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.

A report by CNN points out that this high mortality rate in Italy can bring together two factors: a large number of older citizens in that country, and a lack of capacity to investigate all those who are so far becoming Carnirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus most calmly from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to respect any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was exposed to a lack of prompt and serious response to the danger facing the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance, offering people, whenever possible, to work from their homes and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than 2,500 pounds a month as a measure of support to the population during the crisis.

Despite this, the United States population testing has not started immediately, and the true extent of the disease outbreaks has been hidden during this period.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of a permit of the Federal Government to use non-State testing kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could be done only upon appointment of a medical doctor).

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and curb the spread of infection.
WHO noted the obvious difference between the outbreak of aetonic pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were charged with detecting information, which allegedly prevented disease prevention and its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “has regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban traffic in Ouhana, WHO representative Yearen Galea noted that, although “this measure was definitely recommended not by WHO”, it is also “an important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most widespread sites” and referred to it as “an unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after the ability of infection was confirmed to be transferred from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected persons in other countries, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHELI); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when it was first applied during the pig flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedos Adan, said that the PHEIC announcement was due to “the regional global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO asked the world community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries “who do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Teds also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for our very weakest epidemic” and called on the international community to “make choices: invest or pay for the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO installed the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Teds stated that the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established coordinating all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will make it possible “to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic way”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group that ensured the work of WHO international experts and field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess the “seriousness of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with lead national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the peace must do more to prepare for a possible coronaral pandemic, noting that it is too early to call the pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of a “high” Caravir’s global expansion to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk — would be increased.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a world-wide inspection of each Government to be prepared for real life: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready, and it has been emphasized that the right response can help the world to avoid the “decent scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data do not provide a basis for the global pandemic to be announced by public health officials and added that the proclamation of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected by the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO declared a coronary pandemic outbreak.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction associated with the problem.” WHO has been seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the later proclamation of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation, Mr. Tedos Adanama, Director General of WHO, was asked to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the human rights of everyone during the CVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone was entitled to life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other non-accumbered groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID 19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital platform provides information on the policy measures taken by different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the wheel.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonar of the President of Brazil, Jair Bolson, for their actions to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubay.
A number of provincial leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals were a source of frustration with the response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect Ci Jingpin, Secretary General of the Communist Party of China, from public anger over the eruption of the Crown.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronary outbreak had started in Huhan, but took sides with the theory of the conspiracy that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President’s administration, Donald Trump, called the Crow Chinese virus or Uhana virus, stated that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with a virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement, in turn, was criticized by some commentators, who claim that such an approach is racist and “rejects the inability of the U.S. President’s administration to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Trust has gained access to the U.S. Government Telegraph, which contains a communications strategic trick that appears to have been developed by the National Security Council, with these strategies being mentioned: “The whole case is in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Policio, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the “results” for global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitan component that includes the struggle for influence through the pie and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is insisting on its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike that of the United States”.
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information sending assistance to the last two countries.
The contribution of Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the U.S. sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of relegating assistance for other countries to their own country.
There were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IDP machines to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government revealed a lack of support from the European Union for the benefit of the Caravirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “China alone responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not demonstrate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following telephone contact with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch to Italy of Russian military ambulances, specialized disinfectants and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “necessary or of little benefit to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitic and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi D Mayo, rejected media attacks and thanked the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a medical cargo aircraft to the United States.
Secretary-General Kremlin Dmitriy Peskov stated that “by providing assistance to United States colleagues [Putin], it is assumed that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials develop their production rates, they will also be able to provide response if necessary”.
NATO military exercises, “Protector 2020”, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war, will be conducted in a reduced format.
"The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, has exposed the teachings of Defender 2020: “In the current crisis in public health, these exercises threaten not only the lives of the U.S. and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of countries where such events are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran has been severely affected by the virus, and some two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders to help, stating that his country was struggling with the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed on Iran by the US against Iran, which had led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other wealthier countries, including the introduction of a single health system and the care of children paid for family leave and increased funding for public health.
Political experts expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and that diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea had deteriorated as a result of the pandemic.
South Korea has exposed “ambiguous and passive quarantine” measures by Japan after Japan has announced that any citizen who came from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine in specially reserved government seats.
South Korean society was initially divided by the response of President Moon Jaein to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon Impipment for inadequate, in their view, the Government's response to the outbreak of disease, and forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orbana the right to administer through decrees, suspend the work of Parliament, and to elect and punish those who would be accused of disseminating fairy information on the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The outbreak of the Caravirus was described as the cause of several cases of supply deficits owing to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the procurement of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that there was a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
There have also been panic purchases in several locations, which have resulted in the loss of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and water, which in turn has led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to Mr. Teddy Adanama, Director-General of WHO, the demand for personal protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This leap led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared with the usual price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also gave rise to a lack of personal protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would therefore be hit.
In Australia, in response to the pandemic, the daigo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This has led to a lack of child feeding in some supermarkets and has subsequently been banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of CVID19 in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas have been avoided by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stock accumulation and illicit trade in critical products that have been successful have prevented the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry believes that agricultural prices may increase.
Half of the food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pigs ' stocks to ensure that the population was fully fed.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to maintain emergency food stocks.
The damage to the world economy affected China: According to the media of 16 March, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 because of measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5 per cent reduction in retail sales.
Material China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarai, a staff member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, is predicted to remain in the markets until a clearer picture of potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could exceed the impact of the aetopic pneumatic epidemic, 2002-2004.
According to an assessment made by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “immediate measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to a fall in demand on the part of China.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with CVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, as a result of growing concerns about the tsunami outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow-Jones index for industrial companies, showed the most dramatic fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1191 points, the most daily decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 per cent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions fell again as a result of concerns about the spread of the Caravirus and the worst fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a probability of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and no Government recommendations.
As a result of all of these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in the demand for aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas, and the British Flybe regional airline ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has been more severe than ever.
Several railway stations and port ferry crossings were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chong-June, the main tourist season of China's New Year's Eve.
A number of events involving a large number of people were abolished by national and regional Governments, including the annual New Year's Festival; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Dinseilands.
Many new-day events were cancelled, and tourist attractions were closed to prevent massive accumulations of people; for example, the Holy City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year’s holidays until 10 February, not allowing most enterprises to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency by closing schools until March and abolishing the New Year's celebration, while the retail sector was hit globally: the hours of the shops were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Retail points in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40 per cent.
Retail businesses in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the number of trade centres fell by 3343 per cent compared with February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of public temperature control equipment and the removal of events, according to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14-22 million more people behind the poverty line than would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers have found themselves at home in the provinces of their country or are trapped in Hubei province, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the Government's assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, a coroner's outbreak may deprive 47 million people of jobs, while the unemployment rate may reach 32 per cent; the self-identification measures imposed in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers on a daily basis unemployed; a study by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have experienced unemployment in one way or another; almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidized reduced working schedule, part-time work.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
The fields of art and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic, which affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have attempted to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to a cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their personnel and the public and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed off the world for an indefinite time, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and submissions had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In exchange, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; another recent and emerging legacy of the virus is the removal of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Old Year’s events in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live television or on television, while leaders of some churches offer to perform public service.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed down to attend its churches, the moons and the square of St. Peter, where pilgrims of Christendom are no longer present, and other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and graveyards.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the tsunami and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and residents to the holy places of Mexico and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the world’s sport calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or carried over, including the UEFA League 2019-2020, the Prime League 2019-2020, Euro2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 and the NCP 2019-2020 season.
On 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted after 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021”. Kazino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker Turks, which were usually broadcast live, were either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to move online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also been affected because various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional off-line businesses, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live webcasts or web festivals; this has helped people of creative professions to continue to perform, issue or publish their works.
There are a lot of Internet notifications on the topic of Caravirus, many of which are lawistic, and are countering disturbing moods that characterize uncertainty periods.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as towards people of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
In the February news reports (where most of the infections were still limited to China), racist attitudes were expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or obtained fair retribution for anything.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese attitudes.
Many of the people of Ouhana and Hubeei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, have been supported in both online and online settings.
The epidemic had begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe that had experienced a serious CVID-19 outbreak; hence, citizens of such regions could also be influenced by suspicion and xenophobia; citizens such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had signed a petition at an early stage urging that Chinese nationals should not enter their countries to curb the epidemic.
In Japan the hashtag #ChinaDontCommetoJapan (#China's Non-department) held leading positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report a growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump had been criticized for calling it the Chinese virus; critics considered it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhana to New Sanjara.
Students coming from the border with China of north-eastern India and studying in the major cities of India reported cases of harassment related to the tsunami.
Dilepe Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatia Janata Party, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and had “for this purpose God had given them vengeance”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which referred to them as “abuses”. In China, the pandemic again triggered xenophobia and racism against non-Chinan residents: foreigners began to call “foreign garbage” and objects to be “silverized”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the Carnirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the tsunami publicly available.
Some scholars have decided to provide short-term access to their studies on the publications server of preference, such as biRxiv.

The laboratory testing of the respiratory coronary 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated ATS-ComV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and antibody detection techniques produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the RNA, which recognizes the RNAs.
This test is special and only designed to detect the ATS-COV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm quite recent or active infections.
Antitel (serology) detection can be applied both for diagnostics and for popular control.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who passed the disease, including those whose symptoms were too insignificant to handle them in the hospital or were not available at all.
The exact rate of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from this test.
As of March 2020, owing to the limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was very controversial.
Such differences in knowledge are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
The test can be performed by means of a polymechaneous chain reaction of return transmission in real time (RRT-PCR) on the sample from the respiratory path through different means, including smudges or wet sample.
The results are usually available for a period of from a few hours to two days.
From the beginning of the first week of the disease, O.C.R., the strokes taken from the throat are carried out.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat while still spreading in the lungs.
For infected patients tested during the second week of illness, the alternative may be to extract material from the lower respiratory pathways by means of a desalination catheter, or to use leaching products (motor).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharetet ' s clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymechanic chain reaction with a back-to-day transmission (RRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, Kogenebiotech South Korean company developed a SARS-ComV-2 detection kit based on PCR of clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirs).
It detects the gene "E", a common gene for all beta-Kornivirs, and the RdRp gene specialised for ATS-CoV-2. China ' s BGI Group became one of the first companies authorized by China ' s National Drug Administration to use the RARS-CoV-2 emergency screening kit on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute, through International Reagent Resource, their diagnostic panel for the conduct of RTR-CP at real time (2019-Novell Coronvirs (2019-CoV) Real-Time RT-PC Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three more advanced genetic tests produced incomplete results due to missing reagents and a narrow CDC testing area in Atlanta, which resulted in on average less than 100 trials a day during February 2020.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Monitoring Office as part of an emergency use permit, and U.S. commercial laboratories started testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LaabCorp announced that it would be possible to test COVID19 from the country-wide RRT.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing for CVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; the fees and processing of the analyses must be met in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, a study on COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Centre for Research on HIV and biotechnology, “EECOR”.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Health Oversight Service registered the test, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect CVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large test scale, allowing one car to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test Abbott m2000 system; FDA previously issued such a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives an EBA from FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
FDA also approved a test that replaces the PCR with the amplification of insulated nucleic acids.
Since this test does not require a series of rotating temperatures, it can detect positive results in just five minutes and the negative in 13 minutes.
There are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and a monodone antibody test is currently being developed in Taiwan, which is specifically linked to the nucleapid protein (N-white) of the new Caravirus, and it is hoped that results can be achieved in 15 to 20 minutes, like an express test for flu.
The March 2020 Specialized Literature Review concludes that “the chest transducer has a small diagnostic value in early stages, whereas the results of the CT [computer literature] may be of such value even before symptoms appear”.
The typical features identified in the CT include bilateral multi-dollar sub-dividual focuss of “math glass” with off-site, asymmetrical and asterior distribution.
Sub-tributive domination, the symptom of a log bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic has shown that the CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, because many of its visual functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation that “do not use the CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the CVID-19 diagnostics”. As of March 2020, the initial CDC screening method is recommended for PCR.
The partial immune response to the infection is reflected in the formation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies may be used to detect infection in people after 7th day of symptoms, to define immunity and for the purpose of public control, and may be used in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosis on the ground (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheric blood, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
One sample of blood in PCT is usually obtained by cutting through each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, no sampling phase is required. On 26 March 2020, FDA identified 29 organizations that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and are now able to apply their testing to antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, FDA had approved only one emergency resolution test. At the end of March 2020, Eurommun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for using their test kits, which could be identified in IgG and IGA samples of blood capable of combating the virus.
The test productivity is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
In early April, Britain found that none of its antibody test kits had produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of having a virus stay home: “assisting emergency care workers to pass a sample test to the patient”, the patient spits in it, gives them back and then gets the results of the test after a while. British NHS announced that its piloting of suspicious cases in a home environment that eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other hospital visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it has been used to transport the patient. During the COVID-19 exposure, a medical worker takes an analysis, using all relevant precautionary measures.
Expressing centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Doctors in Germany announced that it was ready to conduct some 12,000 outpatient tests a day, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Coha Institute, Germany ' s overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, pressure testing had been proposed in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests delivered in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the calendar week, 12/2020 at SASS-ComV-2, a total of at least 483,295 analyses, up to the week 12/200, including 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive, with researchers from the Israeli clinics Technology and Rambum Hospital, developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and performing further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. Onhan, 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square metres of emergency cases called “Hoo-Yang” (in Chinese, or “Hudkle eye”), which could produce more than 10,000 samples per day.
The laboratory was organized by the founder BGI Van Jianem and completed in only five days; it was shown that, had the laboratory not been operational at such an accelerated rate, the case in Hubee would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of quarantine would also have been twice higher.
A total of 12 towns in China were opened immediately at the opening of the Ohana laboratory at Huo Yang in Shenzhen, Tiangzin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests a day. A range of Origami Assays, which can be tested to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 samplers, such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulaters.
By March, owing to the shortage and shortage of reagents, mass testing has become a problem in the EU, Britain and the United States.
As a result, some authors have requested test samples to be processed at 98 °C (208°F) for five minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of testing by the United Arab Emirates per capita was now greater than that of any other country and that soon most of the population would be tested.
This was due to express testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory by the Group of 42 and BGI (based on their laboratories for the identification of Huo Jan emergency cases in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of so large a scale that works outside of China.
Different testing options for different parts of the coronary genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of test kits that are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by United States health centres was not available until 28 January, leading to a lack of testing kits in the United States; problems arose at the very beginning of the outbreaks in China and the United States with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient numbers of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts claim, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronary.
Over the years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the CVID-19 pandemic. The growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus has resulted in many U.S. private laboratories, which have produced hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, have been overloaded and stocks of greasing materials and chemical reagents have been rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. CDC test kits had “insufficiency” and, for that reason, the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing; Spain had acquired testing kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the tests were inaccurate.
It explained that the result may be a failure to collect samples or to use wrong kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the inaccurate results sets and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the testing kits that Czecha obtained in China had produced wrong results. 1.2 million test kits acquired by Slovakia in China were also considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that they be dropped in Danube. Atesh Kara, a staff member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the tests acquired in China had “high errors” and that the Ministry had“no use” and that Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but that in early April 2020 it was declared inappropriate to use them.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses have had a positive impact on ATS-ComV-2, as well as monitoring the people who have been contacted by such patients, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voh, where a person from COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two tests of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with intervals of approximately ten days.
About half of the people with a positive result did not have symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed on quarantine.
The entrance to the settlement site was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Caravirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and there were no extreme restrictions such as forced closing of restaurants and shops.
Many of the activities were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore urged the residents to stay home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but they have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries had been able to identify more patients with less pronounced symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID19 analyses to one of 16 WHO control laboratories for proven testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next schedule, the column `good results' is dependent on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage benefit than the country where all citizens are tested, irrespective of the virus symptoms, under other equal conditions.
The washing of hands, also known as “hygienic hands”, is a process of cleaning hands to eliminate pollution, fat, microorganism or other harmful substances.
The regular washing of hands with soap at certain critical moments during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoeas and cholera, which are transmitted out of the system.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. shearing mussels) by his hands.
Five critical points during the day after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after the child's berries or diapers have been washed, before the baby is fed, before eating food, and before and after cooking or the treatment of raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with the help of the potion.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after care procedures.
After the diapers have been changed or the child has been washed up in the toilet.
After shrivelling, coughing, or whining.
After touching animals, cows or wastes of animal origin.
Hands health is a matter of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical aim of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other germs capable of causing disease) and from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hands are very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, measles and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoeal species, reduces respiratory infections,
The infant mortality rate in the household is also decreasing.
The 2013 study showed that a better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking advantage of simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure is able to reduce the mortality rate by almost 50 per cent.
Regular hand washing reminders can reduce the number of diarrhoeas by about one third, which is comparable to providing low-income regions with clean water.
A decrease of 48 per cent in the number of diarrhoea cases may be associated with washing hands with soap; hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (PRCs) if appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
pneumonia, one of the main complications of the INA, is the main cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die of diarrhoea and pneumonia in general every year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap in front of food and after taking a hard toilet can save lives more than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce death from diarrhoea by almost half and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hands are usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hands also prevent impetuous disease, which is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of the frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to drying and, in fact, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too often hand washing can lead to sorority and flicking of skins — a disease known as eczema or cymbal of hands that is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered a symptom of an insulating or composite disorder (RBM).
There are five so-called critical moments during the day when the washing of hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of phecalal/oral transmission of the disease: after the defecation (motivation, defecation), after sedia of the child (removing diapers), before feeding the child, before taking the food, and before/or after cooking or treatment of raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases in which hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after cutting or wounding, after croaking, coughing or wrinkling, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is relatively common.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families with soap-washed hand washing was a common practice. 2014 showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, had been recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was closer to the middle, the figure was 77 per cent; the lowest figure was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there were several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing hand washing with soap in critical situations; in developing countries, group hand washing in school at a given time was one of the methods used to train children in such a procedure.
The Emergency Health Program, implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education, is an example of a large-scale effort to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on de-worming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily cleaning of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from every cover is more effective if soap or cleaning is added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove the barriers to soluble and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective tool for cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins that are components of organic contamination are not easily dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Solid soap, due to multiple applications, may also contain bacteria that may be released from previous use.
A small number of studies on lubricating bacteria from solid soaps on each cover shows a low probability of such exposure, as bacteria wash themselves with foam.
The CDC still claims that “liquid soap is the preferred choice for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health - care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are naturally resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains commonly used antibacterial agents, such as triclans, which are resistant to the many resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic strains are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with advertising.
In addition to surface-active and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (intoxic, aggravated, breast-feeding) as a regulator of URN, as well as anti-mactorial active benzoic acid and other cushions (loss of faith, vitamins, metola, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the Public Health School of the University of Oregon showed that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands, simple varieties were as effective as conventional antibact soap containing triclops.
The hot water of the human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at 37 °C temperature.
However, for the removal of natural fats, containment and bacteria, warm soap is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbulb load on your hands.
A hand disinfectant (saniser) or an antiseptic is a means of treating a person with no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of alcohol-free hand hygiene equipment (also known as disinfective hands on alcohol, antiseptics for hand-deactivation or sanitas) became popular.
Most of these tools are made on the basis of isoppy alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of fillers, such as carbomer (acrylic acid pet) in the form of helium or wetter, such as glycerin in liquid or foam, which makes it easier to use these tools and reduces the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
In addition to the diluted hydrogen transfer, anti-memic activity increases further. The disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol are effectively destroying microbes.
The disinfectants on a alcohol basis kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, ricinary, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and mushrooms.
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (the reduction of 3.5 per cent is similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) in hand after 30 seconds of use and 99.99 per cent are 99.999 per cent bacteria (the reduction of 4-5) on hand in one minute after application, and the disinfecting of the hands is most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
The disinfectants on a alcohol basis are practically ineffective against the norwalk virus, the most common cause of the infectious gastrophy. A sufficient number of antiseptics or alcohol-containing equipment must be used to carefully process and supply the skin of the hands on both sides.
The left and back surfaces of both chains, as well as the space between the fingers, grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are highly contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis can cause the dryness of the skin, if the composition does not contain mitigating tools and (or) wetting.
The skin drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the fund.
In clinical trials, disinfectants on a hands-on alcohol basis containing flammable components caused much less annoyance and dryness of the skin than soap or anti-mixed detergents.
An allergic contact cympathetic syndrome, contact fever syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or supplements present in disinfectants is practically non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritable contactor was a factor in the selection of disinfectants than soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, the means of non-water-freeing do not clear hands of organic substances but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfecting is not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as regular soap and water, as pathogens are still in the hands of pathogens.
The efficiency of the non-spirational hand disinfectant is largely dependent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
Most recently, it has been proved that drugs using ensalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative anti-mixure activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after multiple use, probably because of progressive side-by-side responses.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Salt or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less efficient than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or wheat is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, it is a disinfecting tool, since it produces a celery solution when it is in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO alternatively recommends the use of salt or sand.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing equipment, which includes the following steps:
Dwell your hands under warm or cold running running water.
It is the running water that is recommended, because hundreds of waters can be contaminated, and that's when the temperature doesn't matter.
Help with your hands growing with plenty of soap, including the back of the palms, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when soap (not just one water) is used, people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The three help remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you use your hands, the more the microbes are removed.
Get your hands under the running water.
The filling of hands in standing water may trigger re-absorption.
Keep your hands clean towels or let them dry themselves.
Mokre and wet arms are much easier to pollute, most often leaving areas such as thumbs, wrists, fields between fingers and under fingernails.
The artificial fingernails and the cracking footlause may contain a multitude of micro-organisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be used to prevent drying of the skin of the hand, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are inaccessible, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash hands: the draining of water from a high-water canister or a bottle of baking with finished openings and (or) the use of salinity, if necessary, as is needed in developing countries; there are waterproofing solutions (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries), such as knife cranes and other low-cost options.
A tap with a knife pedestal is a simple structure consisting of a container hung on a rope and a knife growl to be pressed to carry water and a piece of soap should be used.
An effective handshake is an integral part of the process of hand hygiene, but some disputes are being held over the most efficient form of drying in public toilets.
A growing amount of research shows that paper towels are much more greasy than electrical hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the University of Westminster in London sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salfacts and Painting was carried out; the study was the subject of a comparison of the hygiene of paper paintings, warm - air hand dryers and more modern, streaming air joints for hands.
It was found that, after washing and drying hands in a warm air drying, the total amount of bacteria on finger pillows increased by an average of 194 per cent and on pallets by 254 per cent.
It has also been found that, after washing and drying hands in a drying airflow, the total amount of bacteria on finger pillows increases by 42% and 15% on bottoms.
After washing and using paper towels, the total number of bacteria on finger pillows decreased to 76 per cent on average, and the average was 77 per cent on the order, and scientists also tested the possibility of cross-polluting several visitors to toilet rooms and the toilet environment at each type of drying.
The air dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is capable of draining micro-organisms from hand-hand and from its own unit and potentially causing other users to enter the toilet room and the sanule to a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of warm - air hand dryers distributes microorganisms to a radius of up to 0.25 feet [0.25 m] from the dryer.
No large number of micro-organisms were found using paper-based canvass. In 2005, T доV Product und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the amount of bacteria are observed depending on the handbag method:
There are many different producers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfection salfepts can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.
A hand disinfector on a alcohol basis shall contain not less than 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical treatment of hand washing became compulsory long after the Hungarian physician Ignatz Landmelway discovered that he was very effective (1846) in the prevention of disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of hands lasts for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel for washing and antipolluting each part of the hand.
Hands should rub off carefully against each other, greasing their fingers.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a retract to remove it.
Since microbes can stay in the water that is present in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them out with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after the drying of the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids reabsorption of hand pollution from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogens (microbees) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading micro-organisms.
As a result of one study, right hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the blood circulation infection of the catheter by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a leaflet showing the standard hand washing and processing procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand health is also available on its website and open to public debate.
The relevant review was conducted by Witby in co-authorship.
Commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check hand health if required.
The World Health Organization identifies “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptic, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap while washing hands (“medical” or “anti-cycrobic” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery is performed or in high-tech organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, and “cleaning” hands prior to surgical operation requires a tap that can be activated and removed without touching the hand; a little chlorohexide or water should also be used to fill the hands, the vibrate to dry hands after washing, the shortness of the neck for friction, and another sterilized tool to clean under the fingernails.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires hand washing and cutting to the elbow usually for two to six minutes.
There's no need to lose your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the runoff, the water from the foreboding should not be allowed back to the hands’s toss.
After the washing is finished, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth, and they wear a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or to use an antiseptic for use before and after care procedures.
In order to combat staphycock infections, hospitals have found that the first 20 per cent of washing is the greatest benefit of hand washing, and that very little added benefits have been received when the hand washing frequency was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with the washing of antibacterial soap, hand washing by conventional soap has resulted in more than three times the increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. The comparison of the arms counters with sporid solution and the washing of antibacterial soap, on average, 30 seconds per procedure, has shown that the processing of hands by per capita solution has reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hands-on alcohol solutions to reduce by-hand the amount of flu virus A H1N1 and the Klostridium Deficiency dispute, which can include training on hand washing, improving the availability of hands-to-hand alcohol, and written and oral reminders of the need for staff to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important tool to improve health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or tools to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop regular washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from every private or public toilet taps for hand washing, although there are cheap ways of organizing hand washing in such places.
However, inadequate hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and hand washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, there is a need to monitor and evaluate the results.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that in order to improve the health situation in low-middle-income countries, community-based health and epidemiological surveillance was effective, while public marketing campaigns were less effective: one example of advocacy for hand washing in schools was the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund, “Three Star Approach”, which promoted the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that encouraged the hands of students using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with the minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The introduction of handcuffers is one of the possible measures in the context of hand health awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and infant mortality.
The Global Handing Day (Global Handing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at behavioural change, as a result of the Caravirus pandemic 2019-20, the United Nations Children ' s Fund is promoting the use of hand-washing embryos.
Some studies have considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs.
However, one study suggests that washing hands with soap is a far more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was recognized for the first time in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweis (Ignaz Semelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and “the basis of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infection had been caused by rotten smells called miasis.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health-related infections, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand health as an important preventive measure.
As a result of the outbreak of a pig flu in 2009 and the CVID 19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands and soap to protect the body against such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, “hand washing equipment” were removed in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “feeling hands” means that it is not desirable to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate ‘ washed his hands ’ in making a decision about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase later became more widely used in some English communities.
In Macbeth's play, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an effort to rid herself of an imaginary stain of an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed by herself and to incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe any non-ethnic act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and hand-cuffers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after the sight will participate in any other “specting” compensating activities, such as volunteering.
In the faiths, hand washing is both a health objective and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Bahasaism, Hinduism, tevilah, and netlatakudaim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require that we wash our hands after we visit the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, washing hands before and after every meal is considered necessary.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
The control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 refers to the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control the coronary of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of workplace risks depends on the place and the task, is based on the assessment of risks, the seriousness of the situation of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic anti-infection measures, including hand washing, incentives for employees to stay home at the rates of illness, respiratory ethics, and daily cleaning and de-infection of the working environment were required.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspect diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected by current public illness or international travel.
This category may include public relations, such as in schools, a working environment with a high population density and in some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic preventive measures, include high-impact air filters, protective screens and personal protections in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and morgue personnel who have contacted a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to be high-risk, increasing to a very high risk when such personnel carry out procedures accompanied by aerosol education, or collecting/processing samples from a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion at CVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the purpose.
The COVID-19 flash may have various effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.
Business templates may be modified for both the goods for which the demand is available and the means of acquiring such goods (e.g. purchase of non-picable delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be delays in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address the risks of different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from homes and communities, as well as risks from individual workers, such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also identify the monitoring tools needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise from the epidemic.
The preparedness and response plans may be subject to the recommendations of the national or state level.
Some of the goals of response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Response is affected by the severity of disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used for occupational safety and health, for the grouping of these tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 is not addressed, the most effective are the engineering and safety equipment, then the administrative measures and, finally, the personal protections.
Safety engineering means that staff are excluded from work-related risks and do not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by a worker or a staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help address certain risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be chosen according to the threat to the employee, be sized (e.g., respirators), be used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned up or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) is of the view that the posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all jobs, include frequent and careful hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay home, respiratory ethics, including coughing of mouth in coughing and ceasing, providing salfets and garbage containers, ready for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and de-infecting of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat has been stopped, that the body and many other symptoms are no longer intense for at least 24 hours without the use of psychotropic drugs or other medications that eliminate symptoms, and that staff be given flexibility on sick letters, allow staff to stay at home to care for sick family members and ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk posts require frequent and close contact not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not confirmed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but are likely to be infected with the spread of illness in a business-based society or with recent visits by such a person to COVID-19.
These categories include workers who have contacts with the public, such as schools, a high population working environment and some large retail shops. Safety equipment for such groups and higher-risk groups include the installation of high-quality air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for car leaving client services, administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups to remain home, the replacement of personal meetings for communications through virtual means, the establishment of replacement schedules, the termination of non-critical visits to CVID19 distribution sites, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to troubled workers, the provision of relevant training for workers at risk CVID-19 and measures of protection, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the correct use of such tools, resources and working environment that contribute to personal hygiene, and we may require that there be no need to limit to ensure access to the workplace, including the need for the provision of personnel ' s training, and the provision of safety measures to protect the workplace ' s personnel, while ensuring that they are not used to use such tools, but to ensure that the use of the means, resources and the workplace, and working environment to ensure that other personnel are protected from the workplace, including the need to protect the workplace ' s.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is ill on an aircraft, proper safety of workers and other passengers requires measures such as the removal of a sick person from other persons by a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person or the application of such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a cough or chai.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and perhaps additional personal protections if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The use of gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, the safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-insolvement and immediate information to the medical centre on a ship in case of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination must take place in an isolated room of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the incidence of illness in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, for example, the removal of travel for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as exercise or singing, the reception of food in cafes, the increase of party distance, the regulation of arrival and care times, the limitation of minor visits, and the use of separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In addition to social distance strategies, long-term school non-attendance measures may be considered at a significant pace in the local community. For law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of CVID19 be treated with the same instructions as those prescribed by the Feldchers, including the use of appropriate personal protection tools.
When close contact arises during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their uniform belts and remove them until they are reused by using domestic clean aerosols or by anti-rabing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and disposal of used personal protections, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are exposed to high or very high risks.
High-risk posts include medical care, support, laboratory and medical personnel dealing with patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected CVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in their processes accompanied by aerosol education or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol education include probes, coughing, bronchoscopying, some dental procedures and surveys, or the collection of invasive samples.
High-risk members of the morgues are staff involved in the handling of bodies of persons with confirmed illness or suspicion of CVID-19 at the time of their death; if such officers conduct an opening, they are placed in a category of very high risk; additional safety and safety equipment for such groups at risk include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion at CVID-19, including in carrying out procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
Trials should be conducted in accordance with the precautions prescribed for biological safety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the distribution of patients to separate waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection devices, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for employees who are in contact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of a SARS-ComV-2 infection, as well as for those performing procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the U.S., NIOSH respirators approved for a person with a N95 or higher grade filter should be used in an integrated written respiration protection programme that sets out the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of rector may provide better protection and comfort for the staff member; WHO does not recommend the use of special equipment, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that persons collecting samples of respiratory tracts from COVID19 patients or those carrying the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol education carry surgical masks, protective glasses or protective screens for the person, robe and gloves.
Aerosol education procedures should be used instead of surgically masked with a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given the lack of personal protection facilities around the world, WHO recommends that the need for such protections be minimized through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent glasses, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only the means of personal protection required for a specific purpose, the prolonged use of the same respirator, without taking care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating a chain of personal protection equipment, and recommendations not to use masks for those without symptoms.

COVER: [Competed-19] Loading facilitation and preparation for the future
DAST/WORTH OF ADMINISTRATION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UCC
STRENGTHENING: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live under unusual circumstances.
The COVID 19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to have compassion, cooperation and community development around the world, which is the basis of such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, telephones and chats — a remarkable demonstration of the fact that fortunately, we are working with amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed that I appreciated our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for peace to turn to Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that is possible thanks to your work, whether in terms of the capacity of the sites, the payment by our colleagues, or the protection of community security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and it's even more important today than ever before.
At a time when it is important not only what we do but how we do it to achieve meaningful results for peace.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together from the following week.
Adjustments to the order of our work and schedules
As Robin had said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we have considered our ideas for the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, you can do it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
According to our expectations, we will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.
We do not declare holidays: if you can work for more hours normally, this is permitted for our mission ' s purposes.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether you take care of your family, acquire food, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not following your worktime.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and undeniably true, but we mention it.
No pain sheet or vacation is required: simply inform your manager and help the team to revise the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID 19, tell Brian from T&C Ops to ensure that T&C is able to provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and to our hourly staff.
Each person will receive payment under normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This implies, inter alia, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to channel their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially at such times.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we can know what to expect, and we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered substantial.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundrasing (others besides others) are critical and may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and place emphasis on providing support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
Delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to make the lost one” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be required to work overtime to meet the time limit.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work towards setting new goals and timetables, as far as possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
To meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, enabling staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and family care, while all those who need or wish to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
Such an extension would significantly reduce the current planning and tension across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps immediately after confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for its leadership in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to the many precautions, we hired a team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used viral medical solutions to de-infect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator hills, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building is subject to its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the time we decide to return.
Our office in Columbia (DC) is on the Web Network, which shares with us and all personnel in DC with their COVID-19 regulations.
Last week, our office in the District of Colombia went to full remote work, in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York are aware, we have also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If required, longer sessions will consider the possibility of breaking them into a multi-day course.
Identify the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and distribute information in advance.
Use video links to facilitate interaction and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a focal point, a person who will monitor reading issues and monitor the list of speakers, as well as a note manager (or joint observation).
If necessary, please contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Resolution program when buying the food.
Connect to #remots channel in Black to talk to colleagues about the work that's distributed.
The HR Operation team is looking at guidelines on ergonomics that are available in web-format to facilitate the effectiveness of the organization-wide work.
Last week, we asked all members of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikipedia, such as the "editathons", until WHO announced the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such derogations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of conducting concerted cross-border activities, and no one will be fined up for forced delay or change of purpose.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikipedia, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The common moods of the global community are not only grief over the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief from mutual understanding and the ability to focus on one's own communities, Wikipedia and not only.
With regard to the outlook, CRT works on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor impacts and relationships.
We remain in communications on COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar to a special meeting of staff to be held on the following Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PP.
This time, we will take this opportunity to share further relevant information, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other together.
We're together in this situation, and we're ready to help everyone we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such electronic correspondence, while other important information on COVID-19 is from Office Vici.
CRT will update these pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, activities, key workflows, problems with lighting, or other assistance as required, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, please contact Brian Juddan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to enable one another to continue work in order to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our planned work will wait until appropriate time.
Now is the time to support one another and to create a space for the important work to come in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
In order for this to happen, we will need the help of each one of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families and to work with the maximum benefit as soon as that need arises.
Now, please beg your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Briane J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jame V, Joel L, Lynette L, Rian M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadersip Team team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Rian M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-preventing enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface(s) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin-preventing enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising decision to treat cardiovascular diseases, and AC2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some Cavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-preventing enzyme 2 is a cycular metal field located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains a N-end peptide domain M2 and a C-end transport domain for a renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single running membrane protein of type I, and its fermentive active domain falls on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2's extra-membraed domain shall be separated from the transmembraed domain by another enzyme known as the masterpiece, and the resulting dissolved protein shall be released into the bleeding and eventually released with the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar lungs of the type II, the erythelic cells of the thin intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscles of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNAs are also found in the cortex of the brain, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain structure.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE dissolves the hormone angiotensin I into the vessel's vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, removes the carbonate end amino acid of phenyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyseses it into the vasalitor angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also spread a number of other peptics, including [des-Arg9] -brandin, apelin, neurotensin, dinosaur A and damin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acids of SLC6A19 and is present at Hartnupa.
As a transmembrebled protein, ACE2 serves as the main point of the cell entry for some coronary substances, including HCOV-NL63; ATS-COV (SARS) and CARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 protein of the ATS-CoV burner and CARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 fermentary domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomas located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires that the S serial prosthetic protein of the TMPRS2 wearer, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, led some to think that lowering the ACE2 levels in cells can help fight the infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend that the standard therapy for APF and BRA inhibitors continue.
According to a systematic review and metaanalysis, published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared with the control group”.
Moreover, “the problem of pneumonia has also been reduced among patients who have received APF inhibitors who have been at higher risk, pneumonia patients, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with the reduction of mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
It is assumed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve legogen hemorrhoids and oxygen saturations will grow with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lypolysiarids.
rhACE2 is about 10 hours of half-time for people, and the start of the operation is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour exposure period.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with non-transportable classical inhibitors of renin-angiotensinin (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which the Circulating angiotensin II is raised. The added rhACE2 was priced in clinical trials for treatment of acute respiratory disorder.
The COVID19 annexes are mobile phone applications designed to assist with epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, many of the annexes formally supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options have been developed to monitor contacts.
This gave rise to discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems that are based on the geographical location of application users.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join their efforts to integrate support for these applications through Bluetooth directly into their operating systems Android and iOS.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an annex that allows citizens to verify whether they have communicated with people infected with CVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an annex called the TraaceTogether.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be passed under government control. Northern Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!" annex, which works on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and ensures prompt communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the annex was awaiting registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks; similar annexes were planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopComvid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications on the basis of the Singapore Annex of the TroaceTogeter and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an annex with a geozoning function, which aims to ensure that patients with a COVID19 diagnosis do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with systems based on annexes, including false performances and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population is used.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “corviral” applications, Apple restricted the list of types of organizations that could offer their annexes related to the Crown in App Store, including only “formal” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass monitoring of the population through applications related to the Caravirus; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the observation infrastructure created to combat the Carnirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for a limitation of such oversight.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for their public projects:
The observation must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by time limitation reservations;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID19;
The safety and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security shall be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection from abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, should be guaranteed;
All “significant participation” stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, should be ensured. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reports on outBory Brothers (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple have proposed a joint plan to address the ongoing monitoring issue, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operational devices once it is necessary.
In some countries, network tracking of locations is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Networking solutions that have access to baseline location data also have high potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; however, a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis has been used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to form text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only has the Government used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but it has also provided information on the location of the public, which has been possible due to significant changes in the protection of information legislation since the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
Monitoring of contacts in which confidentiality is maintained was a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dated to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups had worked on confidentiality decisions, such as the use of Bluetooth Law Energy (BLE) to register the user ' s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a coordination product that includes both a centralized and decentralized approach and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized communications with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Compact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PAACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device and for all comparisons.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, works on the development of SafePaths, a platform to ensure that confidentiality is preserved in the collection and use of location or route data to track the proliferation of CVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies in the Apps Gone Rogue: Mounting Service in an Epidemic, which was published in March 2020, another similar project was the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma, a company that develops confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to allow users to exchange confidential data on their whereabouts and health status with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of the data.
A global TCN coalition was established on 5 April 2020 by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and warning, which is a key factor for broad dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace reference code used in its official annex.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple companies that monitor Android and IOS mobile platforms announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a Bluetooth combination of Law Energy and cryptography that would preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Provision of tools to enable Governments to establish formal applications to monitor the movement of persons infected by the Caravirus, but with the preservation of data confidentiality
In integrating this function directly into IOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with constant surveillance, first operating the system through updating the operating system, and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
The reprofiling of a drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, task-change or therapeutic diversion of drugs) is a reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than the disease originally prescribed in development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treatment for COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a COVID19 vaccine and the transfusing of reconservation plasma. SARS-ComV-2 contains about 66 proteins exposed to medicines, each of which has several links.
The analysis of these connecting sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID 19 proteins.
The most important protein-mixtures for ATS-CoV-2 are papin-like prosthesis, RNC-dependent RNA-polemeras, helicacies, S and ADF-ribophostas.
Hussain AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinical study studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarities in structure with the most similar drugs approved, in order to accelerate the development of a high-impact drug against ATS-ComV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in treating certain autimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied under the Solidarity Clinical Test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kumoo, announced that the chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine tests would start in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate according to the emergency application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical testing process and only allowed according to EUA as a pilot for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment for clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of ATS-ComV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish Study Group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine, combined with cincin and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are carried out at the University of Duke and Oxford.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon is examining the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
The Chinese clinical trials in Huhan and Shengzhen showed that the Pysypressure is “symbiquitously effective”.
Thirty-five patients in Shenzjeen who accepted the drug received an average of four days, whereas 45 patients who did not accept the drug had 11 days.
Uhana carried out a study that monitored 240 people with pneumonia, one half of them receiving a pharmacist and the other half of them having a vymphony.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results showing the effectiveness of the drug were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan and that it would bring it to university hospitals where it would be used to treat patients with CVID-19 would use military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing the drug, and the drug may be less effective in the cases in question.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
A study on the combination of anti-virus drugs “polyvir” and “retovinir” (Caletra) concluded that “no effective drug use was detected”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit the reproduction of HIV by linking prosthesis.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a connection to the SARS-ComV-2 prosthesis.
WHO has included a lot of pilots and rytowire in the International Solidarity Test.
The Remeder has been created and developed to treat Ebola and Marburg virus, and staff members of the Gilead Sciences have discovered that the Remeder has a viral activity in vitro for a number of lylo-, pneumo-, paramixos- and carvirals.
One of the problems related to anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutation, which may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that the remeder can have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are under way, including two at Cleveland University clinics, one in moderate patients and the other in heavier patients.
Three clinical trials are under way for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, antibiotic tests began in New York State.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to carry out a clinical study of Alvesco (circésonide) Tejina, an inhalian corporation for the treatment of asthma, for use in treating pre-sumptive patients infected with the new coronary virus.
Phase II, the form of angiotensin-preventing enzyme 2, is tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe diseases to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of collicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications among patients with slightly expressed symptoms COVID-19.
A study called COLCONA invited 6,000 adults aged 40 or over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with slight symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective means of contraception cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, there are several coagulants.
Nisomolecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Department of Medicine to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multidisciplinary study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxarine in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As ATS-ComV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, ATS and Western Nile virus.
Rivodirin: Fishwater was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with Chinese recommendations 7th edition.
Umifanovyer: Umafenover was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with Chinese recommendations 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use as COVID-19:
Tocilismumab (R-IL-6) has been approved in China.
Also, the tests in Italy and China, see Tolizamab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against the Caravirus, 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite no clinical trials, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that a vaccine against the ATS-ComV-2 virus would be available earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five candidates for vaccines were conducting phase I security studies.
COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread worldwide, resulting in significant investments in the development and research of the vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against ATS-ComV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, research and development included 10 different technology platforms for an effective vaccine against CVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the phase I security research platform are:
Nucleic acid (DNC and RNA) (Phase I and vaccine drug: Moderna, and RNC-1273)
X-ray virus vector (Phase I manufacturer and vaccine drug: Cansino Biologicals, Adenivirus Type 5 vector)
According to CEPPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Mileken Institute); in addition, 37 still exist, but little information is available (suspected to be in the planning or development stage).
In phases I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenation tests are carried out, typically wounded, flat-controlled and several sites with a simultaneous definition of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and are simultaneously monitored by-products at optimum doses.
Of the 79 highly developed vaccine candidates (as confirmed at early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in human beings (and are still in the pre-clinical phase).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it would examine the potential of a molecular-coil vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccination (VIDO-interVac) of Saskatchewan, Canada, launched its own vaccine to start testing people in 2021.
The beginning of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Shuitmeyker, launched a campaign to develop their vaccine.
Jenssen, together with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, is developing a oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSoluctions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used to vaccinated cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the start of testing.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary company, Generex NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was under way to develop a peptic Ii-Key vaccine against COVID19.
Their aim was to develop a candidate drug for a vaccine that could be tested in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Research Institute, Silver Spring, located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolucions announced that he had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
For the design and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and phase I clinical testing by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even an accelerated vaccine development regime would require at least one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, the Mediago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies, they had developed a particle similar to the Coravirus.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research and testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “great sums” for exclusive access to the Cvid-19 vaccine, which his Government had protested.
On 17 March 2020, the United States pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for joint development of a vaccine based on the IRNC.
BNT162 is a IRNA-based vaccine candidate; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive pre-clinical tests, and their final candidate drug for a vaccine could be tested in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemi Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced the investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themes Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburg.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID19 vaccine are Modnerna, Crevac, Invo, Novax, Universitys of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that they had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they were developing a self-improvised RNA-vacine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of obtaining consistency from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million in funding for 96 medical countermeasures against COVID-19 research projects, including the development of numerous vaccine drug candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
About the same time, the Canadian Government has pledged $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of Cavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburg Medical School reported testing the PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against CVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA had introduced sub-unitary SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibody [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Farmatic School of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a strong struggle.
The DNA will reproduce inside human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the ATS-ComV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM's supercomputers, combined with Hwlett Packard Return, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to disease prevention.
A further earlyized study in Australia covered 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or inefficient.
Early studies on the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transangible mice, other laboratory animals and low-price primates, indicate the need for measures to curb biosafety infection 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against ATS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there is no medication or protective vaccine for ATS that is safe and effective for people.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of aetopic pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to be distributed, it was considered that the SARS study at the time could be the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs against MERS-ComV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (a DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which took place in phase I of clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two were adsenitral (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks were spreading the theory of conspiracy, claiming that the CVID 19 virus was not new and that the vaccine was already in place.
Publications in social networks quoted some patients who claimed that there were patents for the genetic sequence of other strains of Caravirus, such as the Sahara Coravirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), a infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coroner 2 (SARS-ComV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue feelings, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, stomach loss, and pain.
The time between the first symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases result in minor symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and poly-organic deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people have been cured: the virus is mainly spreading with close contact, often through microscopic droplets in the air at cough, chai or conversation.
Although these droplets form in the air, they usually pose a threat to the ground or surface but do not pass through the air over long distances.
People also become infected with the contaminated surface and then with their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it may be available both before symptoms appear and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymechanized chain reaction with back transmission in real time (R-PRC) in an image taken from the nose.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of having a disease, as well as to those who care for it.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks vary: some authorities recommend that they should not be used at all, some recommend that they be used and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local incidence of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infections may not have symptoms or have symptoms of flu, such as fever, cough, tiredness and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain, or sense of chest fatigue, confusion of consciousness, acquiescence, a person or lips, if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
The symptoms of an upper respiratory disease, such as breathing, ridicule, or throat pain, may be common.
Also, there are stomach-to-cycle symptoms, such as tousot, rudder and diarrhoea, in different percentage ratios.
Some of the cases recorded in China were initially simply a feeling of chest fatigue and heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress as it develops in pneumonia, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection, according to available data the symptoms do not show to all infected persons.
The role of such unimproved bearers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that it can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected persons with a non-simplified disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the disease were indisposed.
China ' s National Health Commission has begun to include invertebrate cases on its daily report since 1 April; of 166 cases of infections recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were refused to occur at the time of testing.
Both wetness and sulfins may have a high concentration of the virus.
More drops are added to the air by loud speech than to the normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that in open cough droplets could extend up to four feet [4.5 m] (15 m) apart.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus by bioaerosol would still be possible, and air tests processed by air collectors in corridors outside the human room showed that there was a virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intuitation and cardio-leasing (SLR), may lead to the spraying of breathing products and consequently to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can spread through phecala, but this risk is considered low, and the virus is most common when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus may be before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 others, and that the virus can survive on the surface from a few hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the potato surface, the virus could live within one day, on the plastic surface (semipy) and on stainless steel (AISI 304), up to three days, and on 99 per cent of copper surfaces up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Lights and detergents, if properly used, have a useful impact on the control of contamination: soap destroys the body of fat, deactivating it in this way, and can also remove it from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as bensalkonychloroide and chlorhexid glucone (hyrrug deinfector), are less effective against the virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples of sulfide were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest blood virus concentration, and in the sixth patient, the highest blood virus was detected on the second day of testing.
The heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new, sharp, respiratory syndrome that has been detected for the first time by three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new ATS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaries.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which exposes its protective shell.
Light is the body most exposed to COVID-19 as the virus penetrates into the chemical cells through the angiotensin-preventing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of the light type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and enters the chemical cells by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - sepa (eper).
12 per cent of those infected in the Uhan hospital were diagnosed with severe damage to the myocardium, which is more common in the form of a serious illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system ' s inflammatory response and the immune system observed during the progression of the disease, but acute damage to the myocardial may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 detectors are at heart in large quantities, as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of trimbos (31 per cent) and venous trimbombola (25 per cent) observed patients in IT with COVID-19 and could indicate adverse projections. Autopia of patients killed by COVID-19 showed differential alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytes of inflammatory inflammants in the lungs.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has tropicalism for ACE2-expressive respiratory tracts, patients with a heavy COVID-19 experience symptoms of system hyper-repression.
In particular, it was found that pathogens of GM-CFF T cells are co-ordinated with respiration of IL-6 inflammatory monoliths and heavy pathology of lung patients with COVID-19.
Limphocary infiltrations were also detected during the opening.
WHO also published several testing protocols for this disease.
The long-form real-time chain reaction (RT-PRTR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose but may also be used with the nose or wet pattern.
The results are usually prepared for a period of from a few hours to two days.
It's also possible to take blood tests, but they require two blood trials, taken at two weeks' intervals, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have succeeded in identifying the strains of the Coravirus and in publishing its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop their own polymeometric chain reaction tests (PCR) to determine the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could identify current infection, as well as past contamination, were under development but not yet widely disseminated.
China's experience in examining the results of these tests showed that their accuracy was only 60-70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Agency (FDA) approved the first local diagnostic test and authorized it to be implemented at the end of that month, and the diagnostic instructions issued by Zhongan Uhanan University Hospital indicate methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The two-way sub-tributive focuss of a “math glass” type with off-site, asymmetrical and aposteric distribution are frequent symptoms identified in the early stages of the disease.
Sub-tributive domination, the symptom of a baling bridge (spanting the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little evidence of microscientism and pathophysiology in CVID-19.
Main results of a pathological study carried out in the event of discovery:
Makroscopics: plevirate, pericardite, reservation and light source
Four types of virusic pneumonia may be observed:
light pneumony form: lung cancer, pneumatic hyperplosis, large aetopic pneumatics, interstatic infiltration with lymphocratic infiltration, and multi-nuclear giant cells
heavy pneumatic form: differential alveolar damage (DAD) with a differential alveolar equiate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder (ORDS) and heavy hypposia.
(a) Intensive pneumatics: organization of ads in alveolar and light interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusional insensitivity (DAN-Sydrom); leukeritralist reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding people ' s places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, following the regulations of breathing hygiene, and avoiding blindfolding, nose or mercury with hands that are not washed.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose of the coughing or chahuia, or, in the absence of the salfette, covering the mouth and the nose of the nocturnal arm.
After coughing or cleaning, it is recommended that the hands be treated in a qualitative manner.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use in public places of canned masks, inter alia, to limit the transmission of infections by persons with an insulent duration of the disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens, and have eliminated large public activities.
Distance recommendations also imply that people shall be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no proven effectiveness drug against CVID-19, since the completion of the vaccine is not expected until 2021, most of the anti-exploitation measures in COVID-19 are designed to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “plate out”.
CDC also recommends that hands be washed with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after visits to the toilet or when the hands are heavily polluted, and before eating and after wrinkling, coughing or cleaning.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol (not less than 60 per cent alcohol content) in hand handling but only when soap and water are not available; in regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two prescriptions for local production.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with anti-mic activity.
The transfer of hydrogen is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means of antiseptic processing.
Glyceroll is added as a wetter.
Patients have been shown to support therapy, which may include infectious therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporous membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
Respect for personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets is recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with a light symptom at an early stage of the disease, and WHO and the China National Health Commission have issued recommendations on patient care, hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy doctors and pulmonologists have consolidated the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, the IBC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for CVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first line drugs, some health professionals recommend making choices in favour of paracetamol (acetaminofen) compared with ibuprofen.
In the course of procedures in which air emissions, such as intuitation or hand amputation, may occur, care should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities.
The CDC recommends that medical personnel who are caring for people with COVID-19 should be placed in a safety room (AIIR) as an additional measure, in addition to standard precautionary measures in terms of contact and air. CDC issued recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (ICDs) during the pandemic.
Recommended individual protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in air, such as dust, but are not guaranteed in terms of protection against a specific biological agent when used.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective front screens or, at least, making masks yourself in the home.
In most cases, the COVID-19 currents are insufficient to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or of their alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is required.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study, and there is some evidence that intuition can be avoided by means of a nose oxygen cane with intense air flow or two levels of positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods for patients in critical condition are as effective as IDPs.
Some doctors choose to invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the heavy airflow on the nose. The risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are lacking, and health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in cases of CVID-19 infection in heavy form requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation, and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of those hospitalized from COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The challenge of artificial lung ventilation is compounded by the acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) that develops at COVID-19 and the oxygen flow into more and more problems.
IDPs with the support of air pressure and PQDs are needed to deliver maximum oxygen in the lungs and to ensure minimum damage to ventilation, which may result in a diluting of pneumotorx.
In earlier models, high-velocity PCD fans may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments started in January 2020, and several anti-virus drugs are currently in clinical testing.
The vehicle is the most promising vehicle.
The development of new medicines may extend until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are at the last stages of testing.
Anti-virus drugs can be tested on patients with severe diseases.
Volunteers recommended by WHO participate in tests of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization to use reconvene plasma as a pilot treatment where life is at serious or immediate risk.
Its use was not subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number for their login.
The annex may detect “near contact” by monitoring data and thus identify potential risks of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If there is a potential risk of detection, the annex not only recommends self-insolvention but also sends a notification to the local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor the data of the mobile phones of people suspected to be infected with the Caravirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected persons.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, Germany's federal government agencies and the Robert Coha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
The Regional Commissioner for Health of Italy, Giulio Gallera, reported that cellular operators reported that “40 per cent of people still move across the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour marathon programming on weekends, with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Call, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the Caravirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rori O'Connor's words: “Aggravated social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people”.
The disease may occur in a light form with slight or missing symptoms that remind other common high - air diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with a slight form of disease are generally treated within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with heavy or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Taken women may be at higher risk of having a heavy COVID 19 based on data on other such viruses, such as ATS and MERS, although there is no such data for COVID-19. Some people in COVID-19 may experience light and pneumonia as complications.
For those with the worst time of the COVID-19 disease, the rapid progress can be made in the acute respiratory disorder (ARDS), which causes respiratory deficiency, septic shock or poly-organism.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal plate formation, heart problems, kidneys and liver.
Trombolic abnormalities, especially the increase in protrombina time, were described by 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital from COVID-19 while the kidney function was found at 4 per cent of the group.
About 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 are raised in liver enzymes (transaminas).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were for hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death between patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to studies of early cases, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of the fatal specimens of the lungs show a differential alveolar damage with cellular fibromixide exhibits in both lungs.
There were viral cytopatic changes in pneumatics.
The outer appearance of the light resembled acute respiratory disorder (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, problems with the heart were associated with an increase in the level of the troponene or heart arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to condition due to such regional differences and because of methodological difficulties.
An inadequate calculation of cases in a light manner could lead to overstated mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that death comes from past-acquired diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
In the case of smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 developed in general a total of 1.4 times more frequently, with patients about 2.4 times more frequently in intensive care or dying than nonsmokers, and concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of Hong Kong’s clinic found that some patients who had been cured had a 20-30 per cent reduction in the volume of light and had been diagnosed with damage.
Once cured, it can also lead to “Abservative Medicine”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had a cure developed permanent immunity against him.
According to other coronaries, this is believed to be likely, but it is also reported that after the recovery from COVID 19, the Coravirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, the long duration of the disease, rather than re-absorption, is considered to have been aggravated.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal-born and infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from man to man.
The first 41 cases of confirmed CVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, call 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and time of the disease, and are also influenced by the level of testing, quality of health care systems, treatment schemes used, time from outbreak to outbreak of disease, and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO introduced an ICB-10 emergency code: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-ComV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed CVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-ComV-2 infection, which is the number of deaths attributed to the number of cases diagnosed within a certain period of time.
According to statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infections as at 17 April 2020 is 6.9 per cent (153,822/240 191).
This figure varies depending on the region, some other methods include the definition of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the mortality rate due to transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect a certain segment of the population from the point of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all the patients who have passed the infection, the presence of these antibodies makes it clear how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castillo d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 percent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of the quarantine among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, Germany ' s health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.04 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and the rates of mortality vary among men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest risk group is that of men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is decreasing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this disparity are unknown, but may include genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower smoking among women, associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were from men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government does not provide gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and RSI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the disease COVID-19.
WHO Head, Mr. Tedos Adane Gebreiss, explains: “CO” means “coron”, “VI” — virus, “D” — “disease” (discease) and 19 — the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species or groups of human beings, as required by the international names recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus, which causes CVID-19, is called severe acute coronaral respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-ComV-2).
WHO has also used the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “the LOVID-19 virus” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "corviral."
During the initial outbreak, in Huhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as “cornirus” and “hynyknirus”.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “smart respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nComV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SAR-CoV-2" were published.
Because of limitations in standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as nose brushes and parts of IDP equipment.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, then one of the local factories was re- Уставіцьled and was able to type the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the first outbreak of COVID19, various conspirator theories, disinformation and flash information on the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects have been made available on the Internet.
Humans are likely to be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine for virus or medication to treat it.
Various international research studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are under way by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test), the aim of which is to assess the medical effects of four existing compounds, which are considered to be the most effective to date.
There is not yet a ready vaccine, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine medications.
Both ATS-ComV and CARS-ComV-2 penetrate the human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies carried out in ATS-ComV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create an entire virium vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or non-active, is intended to cause a rapid human immune response to a new CVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a sub-unit vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain individuals of the virus.
In the case of ATS-ComV-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-chip protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nuclein-based vaccines (DNC or RNA-vacines, new vaccine methodology).
Pilot vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical vaccine test for four volunteers was launched in Seattle.
Vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease, and anti-tellonic increase has been identified as a potential problem in the development of vaccines from ATS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests have been conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria were estimated for seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling anti-virus drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III were carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate medicines for COVID-19 was carried out. For the same purpose, several other existing anti-virus drugs are also being considered for treatment of COVID-19, including remeder, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a pilot / rytowire, as well as a pilot / ritovir, combined with an interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is preliminary data on the effectiveness of the remeducator.
Clinical improvements were observed by patients who received the remeducator as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already in the United States, China and Italy; the use of chloroquine previously used for malaria was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Huhan Institute of HIV/AIDS recommends a daily dose in one unit, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency permit for hydroxychloroquine and chlorine at the discretion of doctors who treat patients with COVID-19. Chinese instructions on the 7th edition also set out interferon, fishy or biphenyl as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of fish are needed to inhibit ATS-COV-2 in vitro.
The Nitsoxonide was recommended for detailed study in vivo, showing that ATS-CoV-2 was impregnated in low concentrations. Studies have shown that, in order to infiltrate ATS-ComV-2, by interacting with the ACE2 receptor, the protein of the transmembraed sulphur 2 is needed (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chlorine and hydroxychloroquine with or without asitromycin, which prevents the medical community from using these treatments without further study, is not exhausting ATS-COV-2 in vitro and its role in treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercyclicemia may arise as complications at later stages of heavy COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercycycinemia properties, as a result of a small study conducted by the Chinese National Health Commission, the recommendations for the treatment of measles have been included.
The drug was performed at the national level in Italy at the 2nd stage of the unannounced test after the positive results had been obtained from patients with severe forms of the disease.
In combination with blood serum analysis on pheraryin to detect cytocin storms, it is intended to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by interleucin 6 receptor antagonist, based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractor cyclide caused by another cause, T-cell therapy for CAR.
To date, there is no randomized or controlled evidence that ocliosis is an effective means of treating cytocin release syndrome.
Transmitted and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems for patients who have recovered from CVID-19 are now seen as a non-vacious passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested when patients from ATS are treated, but the results are not convincing.
The nitricization of the virus is the expected effect that passive antibody therapy can protect against ATS-ComV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-telo-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagcyclosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antitel therapy, for example using mono-generic antibodies, are in the process of being developed.
There may be an increase in the use of reconvening serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of cured patients and contains antibodies against the virus.
Corraviral diseases, group of high-level syndromes
Lee Wenland, a doctor at Uhana’s central clinic, later infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
