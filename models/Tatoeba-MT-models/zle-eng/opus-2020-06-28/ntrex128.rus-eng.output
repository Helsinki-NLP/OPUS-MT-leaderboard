Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “go to the map”
Among some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to adopt for their name an MWP abbreviation (from the Member of the Wales Parliament).
A problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the labourists, expressing the view of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “is being modified by the Twp and the Pwp”.
For our readers, it's not from Wales: on the Wallish twp, it's a "tube", but pwp is a "baby".
According to a Assembly member from the Party of Wales, his organization was generally “satisfied” and suggested other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “does not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to writing Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Wallly is rendered in approximately the letter u in the Jordanian dialect.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a name change law, made the following statement: “The final decision on what members will be called Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind them”.
The Wales National Assembly Act of 2017 authorized the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of the public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament Wales” option, instead of “the Assembly”, found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of Assembly members, the Committee preferred the “Welsch Parliament Members” option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
It seems that members of the Assembly are offering other options, but the presiding member, Elina Jones, will not find it easy to find a suitable solution, but we recall that the draft law on changes should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee system.
Members will vote in favour of the final version of their title during the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, the citizens of Macedonia will vote for a change in the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims for the Greek province and has repeatedly objected to the entry of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposer of the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to accept the results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that a change in the name of the country is the total price of accession to the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Gallem approaches: St. Martin's colossus has been stopped forever.
“The residents of the regions I was talking to said that they used to be at every corner of the bar and in the church, ” Adams explains.
"And now there is no one left."
The disappearance of bars is yet to be understood:
“Communication has changed”.
“Bar has ceased to be a sort of hotel for the whole area where they came regularly.”
But as for churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds derived from the sale of assets will be sufficient for a short time, no matter how much the leaders trust.
At the seat of the church, he added, a multi-family home will be established, whose tenants are unlikely to support the arrivals that remain in the area.
“The majority of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “This will bring near the day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbours will never come to their senses.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black region: Metropolitan Commission in 1870 and St. Martin’s church 10 years later.
The early Methodist Church had abandoned its arrival in the 1930s.
Their building was redeemed by a black coming from the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, she was led by the reverendant John Howard Johnson, who organized boycott shops on 125th Street, the main trading artery of Harlem, where she refused to take up employment or to raise blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged as a result of the fire, and during the reconstruction, the residents of Father Johnson ordered the establishment of a carillon.
Dear David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who replaced him at the head of St. Martin's church, proudly referred to the dwarf as “a rock for the poor”.
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it a different “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the Carylon of St. Martin that was the world's first kind of black music player, Dionysio A. Lind. He was invited to play a larger dwarf in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriezer, St. Martin's church has not yet found a substitute for him.
For the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has faced a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting was attended by a governing body of secular leaders in July, expressing concern that the diocese “attributing the value of the work” to the congregation, although the latter had no regard for the selection of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the people who came to visit expressed frustration at the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, the shark hit a 13-year-old diver who was making lobster mining.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, in California a 13-year-old diver was attacked and injured by a shark.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Beach Beach Beach in Encintas.
As Chad Hammel told us in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with his friends and heard the boy's cries for help about half an hour later, and with his friends, they rushed onto the boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the adolescent out of the water.
According to Hammela, he first decided that the boy was excited about the lobster’s nest, but quickly “he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I had bitten!
I was bitten."
The diver, Hammel, found that “he had a completely broken skin around the key.”
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘ Get the shark down, ’ ” says Hammel.
A boy was taken by helicopter to Radi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The species of a shark that was attacked by a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Hayles, told the press that a few weeks ago a shark had been seen there but had not been taken to dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries in the upper body area.
The authorities closed the zone from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Stami beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Heles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinesbury plans to conquer the British perfume-space market
Seinesbury is going to set up cosmetic and perfume units at Booths, Superdrag, and Debenhams with cosmetic consultants, on a model of lex hives.
The British parametric market is estimated to be Pound2.8 billion and is continuing to expand, while in fashions and goods for sale, large share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country will be presented to space and perfume units, and should they be expected to be successful next year in many other shops.
The owners of supermarkets are looking for more than filling up the lines previously placed under television, microwave furnaces, goods for the home, and investment in the perfumed cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinesbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 names; for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing association from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods at Booths.
In addition, there will be a reorganised “Buic cosmetic” product line, which will be moved to veg products to accommodate the requests of young buyers.
The two shops in Seinesbury will present the cut-off company Fragrance Sop, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Celly Ouk, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small volume of food every day in small shops near home have led to supermarkets being forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Koop, President Seinesbury, says that it will gradually become a department store, and his supermarket network fights for buyers in competitive struggle against cheap stores like Aldy and Lidle, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of Sinesbury supermarkets, there are Argos laptops, and some of them can now be found Habitat shops since the network purchased both stamps two years ago, which have increased the sale of food and profits from these purchases.
The earlier attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and optical divisions have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture of Seinesbury and Booths was organized, but in the future there were differences among participants on the sharing of income from the sale of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinesbury pharmaceutical business (all 281 shops) of Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farms network, for 125 million pounds three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxuries to the La Roche-Pasay and Vihy at four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetic divisions to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be prepared to help.
We'll have lots of customers looking for cosmetics and perfumes, and that's a very new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrote" responded to Holly Willoughby's business at Pound11 million.
Starving the dragon Lugo show, Peter Jones was driven by a TV broadcaster, Holly Willowby, of a £11 million deal that she was planning to make with Peter's Laifstal-brand, but instead chose new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoub doesn't have time for their joint mark on their home clothes and Truley astronauts.
The business of this couple was compared to that of Goop actress Gwynette Peltrou.
The 37-year-old chairman of the “Etim Morning” programme announced its decision in the Instamogram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable Lifeline brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led Peter Jones, the Lugo Dragon star to the rage.
According to our sources, Jones was “disposed” when a TV fan at a busy meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowa, Bangkokshire, admitted that after entering into new contracts with a value of up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time to share their common mark of home dress and axaure Troy.
Their stamp was compared to an actress, Gwynette Peltrou, with a Goop stamp, and it was expected that its sales would double the Willowi state estimated at Pound11 million.
A 37-year-old leader announced his departure to Instamogram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Truleymark was the top priority for Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to all parties to the transaction.
All were shocked on Tuesday, since the stamps remained weeks before the start.
At Marlowa headquarters, a warehouse filled with products ready for sale remained full.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of a leading British star from the “Etima morning”, one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost a firm millions of pounds [millions] owing to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
In addition, there is a break in the relationship between friends of old.
The raising three children of Willoby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years now.
Willowby created a brand of Truley with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on leave together, with 40 per cent of the shares of Dan Baldwin ' s television company being held by Jones.
Willowbi will be the Ambassador of Marks M&S and will replace Anthony McDartlin as the leading transfer of ITV, I'm a famous man.
A source from close circle Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his business”.
Complex negotiations, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He complained about the criticism that the media would bring against him because of the “independable president” of the comment and the positive appreciation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump reject such claims?
He said Trump imitated the voice of leading news.
"I have not given up."
He noted that Kim Cheng Yin was interested in a second meeting after Trump called them the first summit in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to an impasse.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a high-level North Korean diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, a statement stating that North Korea is still waiting for “responsible responses” from the United States following the initial Democratic People's Republic of Korea's disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, noted the diplomat, continues to use the sanctions as a means of exerting pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“ It’s going to be great with North Korea, ” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could die.
And now we have a good relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Cheng Yin have borne fruit, resulting in the end of missile tests, the hostages and the United States troops remaining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have also returned to their homeland.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Cheng Yin, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“It would be as simple as the President’s pleasure, but instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are in this fully beaten room, there would be only 200 people here, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd that was gathered before him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, casualties calculated by hundreds
In the early days after the Lombok earthquake, a foreign NNGO said that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok ' s population had lost a roof over the head, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy, ” explains Celina Sambung.
Save the Children prepares the team for departure to Palm, but we do not yet know if a foreign team can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, an official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, Indonesia is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palm to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the constant seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains extremely poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Although there were tsunami shelters in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
Despite the tsunami warning, sirens were not included in the Palestinian region to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport links between many Indonesian islands are quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital, formerly docked in Lombok for earthquake victims, is headed to Palm, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's infrastructure as the main point of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, which was running for a new term next year, lost its funding problems.
The President is also criticized for the increasing inter-religious strife between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were lost as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows and other suicides.

Memorial of Cromwell before the House of Parliament triggered a bitter discussion on “Clapitation of History”
The expulsion of Cromwell would have been a well-deserved retribution for the barbarous destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society referred to the proposal by Mr. Cryk as “sympathy” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldmite, president of the Memorial Society of Cromwell, stated: “The question of Oliver Cromwell’s statue before the Westminster Palace inevitably arose in the ongoing debate about the demolition of historical monuments.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconophobic movement during the British civil war.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The magnificent statue of the Cromwell Copyright by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmit stated: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in which case the monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains a subject of professional debate.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was an important historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as the Lord-Prospector are also to be commended and respected.”
The Chinese farmer killed a killer pig
In one of South-West China's markets, a farmer is a victim of pigs, reports local media.
The bloodless body of the victim (the media mention only his last name, “Juan”) with a broken artery was found next to a hunk in the market in the Lupanshay district of Guyzhou province in southern China, reports the Morning Post on Sunday.
The lead is preparing to introduce lead vaccinations on the pig farm, on 30 May 2005, of Sinin Province of China, Qinghai.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and arrived for sale to 15 pigs.
The next morning a cousin discovered the helpless body of Yuan, and the door to a neighboring pig was opened.
There was a huge chroche with blood on the elk.
The forensic study found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms was killed by a farmer.
“ My brother’s feet were bloody and distorted, ” reported the newspaper Guyang Evening News Wu, a victim of the victim.
The video from observation cameras showed that Yuan had come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
Killing pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a single fire during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is engaged in negotiations with the market administration for compensation for the death of a farmer.
There are often cases of pig attacks on people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal brought a Wally peasant to the tractor and let him go, only afraid of his wife.
In 2012, a farmer in the U.S. state of Oregon was eaten by his own pigs, and as a Canadian farmer described the CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “launching mechanism”.
“Wisdom be to play,
They're bitten and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You just need to teach your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall to a large part of south-west USA
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to lose strength as he moves through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, it will bring rainfall and floods to northern Mexico and south-west USA within the next few days.
As of Saturday, 5 hours in New York City, the cyclone reached the 1st category of wind up to 135 km/h, which is 360 kilometres south-west of Punta-Ehudia (Mexico).
A hurricane is expected to move north in the Sundays.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is being formed over the Pacific, which will move east to the west coast of the United States, approaching the coast of Lower California, and will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone is due to heavy rainfall in the coming days of the South-West.
The rainfall from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall, dirty flow and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, the high tropical air humidity may cause rainfall to reach 5 to 8 cm in an hour.
In some areas south-west of the United States, most of the territory of Arizona is expected to fall to between 5 and 10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods is not excluded because of the uneven distribution of tropical rain.
At the present risk of tropical rain, burning in the desert can have serious consequences.
The lions can turn the canons into stormy rivers, and the thunder can cause broken winds to lift up the clouds of dust.
A low-pressure zone on the coast of southern California will be hit by a rainstorm.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which may cause small muddy flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first rainfall since the rainy season began in the region.
There will be tropical rains on Sunday night and morning in Arizona on Monday afternoon, which will extend to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rainfall would pass in the four corners area and last until evening.
In October there will be sharp temperatures in the United States, due to low Arctic air temperature at a sufficiently high temperature in the Tropics.
Sometimes this combination results in severe temperatures in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly visible in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between the Kanzas City, Missouri, and Omama, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De-Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread elsewhere.
In most of the central and eastern US territories, the weather is expected to warm in early October, and the temperature will be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C] in the area from the southern plain to the North-East.
In New York, on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with great likelihood of extremely high temperatures on the eastern coast of the United States until mid-October.
Judge Brett Kawano's Senate hearings have seen more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Bretta Cavano and Cristina Blazi Ford, who accuses Kawano of an attempted rape in the 1980s, brought to their attention on Thursday over 20 million viewers of six television channels.
The political opposition to the allegation of the Kawano candidate was followed by an urgent report by the media on Friday: the Republican Jeff Flake placed a condition that charges against a lawyer for one week be investigated by the FBI.
As Ford said at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she at 100 per cent was convinced that Kavanao had attacked her in a state of intoxication and had tried to strip her naked at a school party.
Kavanao gave an emotional statement, saying that 100 percent was sure it wasn't.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, there were more than 20.4 million spectators in the Friday debate.
The Agency took into account the average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSCBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account the audience watching TV on the job.
In comparison, this is the average audience following the U.S. football match in the Oscar Pleaf or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose leading supporters strongly supported the appointment of Cavano: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, took an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported the Nielsen Agency.
The second place is ABC, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNC saw 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After listening, the interest in the matter was not weakened.
There was a real play on Friday with Jeff Flake.
After a senator from Arison, considered to be a moderate republican, reported his intention to support Kawano, TV channels CNN and CBS were able to seal onto the camera, as on Friday morning at the meeting of the Flyke Legal Committee, an elevator with a group of activists who had been criticized by the senator.
The whole world has seen him go down and get a blow from angry women in live CNN.
“I am standing in front of you, ” said one of them.
“Do you think he's telling the country the truth?”
“The power behind you, while so many women are powerless, ” tried to explain their position to the woman.
Flake responded to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed by hiding the senator from the cells everywhere.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve Kawano's nomination for the post of judge and to send it to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake made one condition: to investigate the FBI on these charges against the candidate by the following week, as a democratic minority sought.
Flake claims to have changed his opinion through the intervention of a friend, a senator from the democracies of Chris Kons.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several senators.
Flake's decision had the effect, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked the vote to approve Kavano without conducting an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses his critics of political games around the situation of Brexitt
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians of having criticized her plan to leave the European Union for taking a narrower interest in society.
The British Prime Minister attended a conference of a conservative party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published in a band of interviews with May, former head of MID Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shake” plan within Brexit, claiming that the entry of customs duties between Great Britain and the EU was “excellently blind”.

The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketballist who had played for the University of Louisiana.
As reported by the Bagon-Ruza police, Daoon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and detained on charges of second degree murder.
The police published a video of a fight with Simsa and Simpson, in which Sims lost his points.

During the interrogation, Simpson confessed that Wade was fatally wounded.
According to Advocate, Simpson has a deposit of $350,000.
The Eastern Coroner of Baton Roja published a preliminary sentence on Friday: death was caused by a combined head and neck wound.
The Division commends the Criminal Investigation Unit of the State Police in Louisiana, the State Criminal Police Laboratory, the Southern University police and local residents who helped with the operational and search activities that led to detention.
Joe Allev, the sports director of the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “precious work in the name of the criminal”.
She was only 20 years old.
The two-metre trourd was born to Baton Roja; his father, Wayne, also played on the team of the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims picked up 5.6 points and made 2.6 rounds on average for the match.
A team coach, Will Wade, made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims had caused a “shock” and a“ real woe” to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of, ” added the coach.
The volcano covered Mexico City.
The Vulcan Popocatepetl slept in the heat of the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, Mexico ' s National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the population should not approach the volcano, with 183 greenhouse gas emissions recorded in its crane.
The Centre observed that there was often a snorkeling and snorkeling in the vicinity of the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochiilko, social media users have published photographs of frontal lobe cars covered with thin layer of ashes.
Following an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded an ongoing volcanic activity of 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The Vulcan Popocatepetl (or, for its own, “Don Goyo”) has been active volcano since 1994.
Clashes of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
The first anniversary of the referendum on the departure of Catalonia from Spain, which broke the country into two camps, was held in Barcelona on Saturday, and there was no clashes between supporters of autonomy and police officers; six rioters were detained.
Police officers were distraught by the protestors of independence, while the latter, wrapped in black masks, threw into custody the order of eggs and powdered paints, raising clouds of dark dust at the heart of Barcelona.
After the police set in the truncheons to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
In the hours of their independence, protagonists shouted: “We won’t forget, I don’t forget!” and their opponents answered them with the slogan, “Yes, Spain!”
According to local press reports, 14 participants were slightly injured in the hospital.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized as being illegal by the Spanish Government, but as an important milestone for separatists, a year later, in a region seeking sovereignty.
The Catholic delegation voted in favour of withdrawal from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of the exit tended to boycott the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year almost 1,000 people were injured in police attempts to block a referendum at the country ' s polling sites.
On Friday, the separatists made a statement on the route of demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from happening.
The demonstration took place anyway, but went on another route.
A 68-year-old electrician named Narciss Termes, who visited his wife’s separatists, said that the hope of acquiring sovereignty by Catalonia was becoming more and more felicitous.
"The past year has seen one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents wept for happiness, having been given the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in an elevated state,” he says.
In the recent December elections to local authorities of the Catalan parties in favour of secession from Spain, there was an important victory, albeit with a small break, but this year their movement loses its supporters because many prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting their role in organizing a referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanics who recorded a rally in support of the police, said that the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added, “There is a growing tension. ”
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, who had been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to compete with the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish Government,” he says.
Londonders: the car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
A house in London was vehicleed several times, and men who were 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested.
The mission took place on Thursday around 19:30 local time in the Balligandard Creent area.
As a result, the tanks were damaged by the gate and the building itself was damaged, reports the Inspector of Criminal Police Bob Blamings.
There are reports that a bow shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston victory over Rangers is thanks to Mengi's head.
The first Head of Dolly Mangi brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingston team
The live ball, Livingston, has won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish Club, Stephen Gerard, this is just the second battle for 18 games.
The exact impact of Dolly Mangi was to balance Gary Holt with the Hibernian Club in a set of accounts where they divide the second place.
The Gerard Club was without victory at the premier League season, and on Sunday, they are meeting with the leaders of the group, Harts, from which Raingers is falling for eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will host its field of the League of Europe match with the Austrian Rosed Club (Vienna).
Livingston Club continues its win-win series in the crowd, playing six more matches without having suffered any injuries since Holt changed Kenny Miller as the team chief coach.
Missing moments for Libingstone in interception with Nazi guests
The secondary coach of Holt had to keep an account from the very beginning — the nudgers had clearly failed to handle them.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defense line, but his weak attempt did not go out, and Alan Litgo’s defender, moved too wide, was unable to prevent Keig Hunkett’s ball from getting into the network.
The host party allowed Rangers to play in front of their defence line, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers gave up a free blow, and Livingston seized the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menga, which had made it from a central position.
By that point, the Rangers had superior control of the ball, but the protection of the host team was unfettered, so Liam Kelly's gate was not concerned.
The second secret continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to hit Alfredo Morelos.
Allan Macgragor naked from Scott Pitman, and Litgo made a big deal of standard provision.
While being constantly caught in the Livilston fine, all attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the toolbar were not met by the Grenna Midlton Hackett, one by one.
Libingstone — Analysis
From BBC Scottland - Asander Lamont, reporting from the Tani Macaroni Arena
It's a literary game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great, and the next time they waited, they continued their visit to the soccer Olymp.
Their style of play and composition have not changed since they were raised to the top of the rating, and the great credit for coach Holt is that he has mobilized the team from the beginning.
He had a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Huckett led an excellent, organized defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
In the meantime, the Rangers couldn't get involved in the rhythm.
Although they had good game moments with Coach Gerard, this time they failed to meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they had no possession of the ball, but only once, they had been able to pass protection to the host team. Rangers, who were down at the middle of the table, was thinking about what they were doing.
Erdogan's cool reception during his visit to Cologne
Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, it was a beautiful weather, and both of them were in a fine mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO participating countries, a visit already associated with some of the conflicts.
It was not possible for heads of countries to find an understanding of human rights, press freedom and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
There is the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
Because of security considerations, the police did not let a 25-month crowd into the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters set up nearby to see their president.
Opposers of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, also gathered in the same place to condemn both Erdogan ' s policy and the German Government ' s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The existence of radical opposing views at the meeting reflects the mixed nature of the figure, with many Germans with Turkish roots exceeding Erdogan, while others consider it to be tyrants.
Dupford Road accident: collision with the car led to the death of a bicyclist
In London, the car faced a bicyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred close to Bezud Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the south-eastern part of the city of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulances who arrived in the area tried to help the rider, but the man died without consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile [1.5 km] from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was shot down by a car whose driver had fled.
The London Police reported that work was currently under way to identify the deceased and notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads and bus routes are closed at the scene: motorists are asked not to visit the area.
Long-Lartin prison disorder: six policemen wounded
Six policemen were reported to have been injured during the riots committed in the male security prison, according to the Long-Lartin administration.
In Long-Lartin, Westshire, the male prison continued the riots about 09:30 local time.
To suppress the riots in which eight prisoners from one wing participated, a “Tornado” operation was formed.
The police were slightly damaged by the soft tissue of a person; they were provided with medical care on the ground.
According to the prison official, “Courted staff were recruited to resolve the incident at Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We will categorically dispute the use of physical force in our establishment, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measures may be changed for longer periods.”
More than 500 prisoners are currently detained in Long-Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been admitted to a hospital when a prisoner was attacked.
In October of last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special-purpose units in order to calm down the broken-up prisoners who dropped the pools of guards.
Hurricane Rosa may sink up Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry areas)
Arizona rarely enters the zone of intensive tropical cyclones, but this time it is “in luck”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, when he has a last blast, must pass over the desert of South-West and carry the risk of rainfall floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of rainfall on Monday and Tuesdays in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Fenices, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and fall through a rainstorm on Monday evening.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Fenices reported in Twitter that “ten tropical cyclones have been kept in tropical storm status or depression since 1950, at a radius of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Catherine (in 1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arison border.”
According to recent National Meteorological Service forecasts, between 5 and 10 cm of precipitation will occur, reaching 15 cm on the Moglon Rom Plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Scalytic Mountains and the Greater Bassein, it is possible that rainfall may fall to 2.5 to 5 cm, and rainfall can reach 10 cm.
The region has long suffered from drought for areas that will be hit by torrential flow, the rain that has been brought by Hurricane Rosa.
Although rainfall floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can facilitate the dry season that is not in the Southwest.
According to U.S. Driveht Monitor, at least 40 per cent of the territory of Arizona has severe drought (category 2nd),” reports the website of weather.com.
At first, Hurricane Rosa will hit the state of Mexico in Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is located some 360 kilometres south of Punta Eujania (Mexico) and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricanes have found themselves in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast, thus losing their strength.
In the afternoon, the storm will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that there will be massive rainfall in selected areas of Mexico, threatening floods.
“In the territory of Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, between 7 and 10 cm of precipitation, up to 25 cm, ” reports the website.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then travel north across Mexico and will arrive on Tuesday morning at the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone, and from Arizona, he will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The fundamental potential risk posed by Hurricane Rosa and its residues is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the desert areas of south-west United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The rainfall is expected to cause dangerous rainfall, dirty waste flows in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four suspects detained in attempted murder

The victim of a serious injury attempted to find Midsomer Norton in the area of Eselsior Terras in the town of Midsomer on Saturday morning.
After the hospitalization, his condition is assessed as stable.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 years were arrested in the Radstock area, reporting to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to a crime with any video recordings of a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "The whole hatred, all the anger of the democracies broke out on Kavanao"
“The Golos for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the democracies,” said Trump at a meeting of his fellow citizens in Wilinga, West Virginia.
In the view of Trump, during the approval of Kavano ' s candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party was broken.
On Thursday, Cavano gave testimony at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment, categorically denied the charges of Christina Blazi Ford that he sexually abused her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave testimony during the hearing on her charge.
On Saturday, the U.S. President said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant minds, class and courage” of Kawano.
“The voice for the approval of Judge Kawano is a voice for the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unswerving public record,” declared the President a crowd of his fellows in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of the amnesty of Kavano, referring to the importance of the Republican appearance for elections to Congress and to the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks.
I don't participate in them, but I'm in a race in another way," he said.
"I am wearing as a naked man, and I am fighting for our excellent candidates."
Trump believes that the democratics have set themselves on the task of “power to resist us all”.
In respect of the rules, the first key ballot in the Senate for the confirmation of the candidature of Kavano should be held no later than Friday, and the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, and many had suffered huge waves taking over the Indonesian island of Sulaves, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in the city of Palu, where, on Friday afternoon, the coast was filled with waves nearly six metres high, all laughing on their way, leading to the sudden death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnetoid 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately and lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office, during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t come alone, and there were cars, log, whole homes, and land, ” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had hit the coast with all its might.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
The disaster management aerial site has seen destroyed homes, shops, bridges and a mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal town was still rocking the floors.
The series of earthquakes took place in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Agency's Statement on Technology Assessment and Use of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake-prone energy emissions were about 200 times higher than those of the atomic bomb that had destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have proved to be stronger than expected by the geographical location of the town at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Nugroho described damage as “scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The ruins of the destroyed buildings have revealed the bodies of the dead; 540 people have been injured and 29 others are missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast by 300 kilometres from Palm, at the Dungala site, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications from Dungala were “full of destruction, no information received”.
“In the Dungala region, over 300,000 people live,” reports the communiqué of the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has taken place, but it is not yet a limit, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the tsunami in the Palestinian region on time, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks have produced a loving video in which a man on the top floor shouts about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to draw people's attention on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water is hit on the shore, and entire homes and cars are built.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to large depreciation of electrolysis, causing the loss of communications to Palm, which made it very difficult for rescue operations to take place.
Military transport aircraft were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities and reports from government sources.
The city airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vido will visit the evacuation centres in Palm on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision have arrived safely from Dungala to Palm, where the staff have found shelter in the tardy tents in the yard of their office building.
“They have seen a great multitude of destroyed houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Beneficial organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCB specialists have not been able to reach Palm.
Indonesia ' s legislation allowed funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of the disaster site as a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” reports Aulia Ariani, the Indonesian Red Cross press secretary.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but for the time being, status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palm, friends and relatives of the missing people still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will bring the people back to the best.
Saturday was saved by a little boy who fell into a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, rescue workers were taken from the wreckage of the two-day building of a woman near her mother's indisposed body.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer of Indonesia's National Assembly on Paraplannerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped at the Roy Roy Hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
"I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive," he said.
He recalls that when he learned of the collapse of the father of Roy Roe from other paraplanerists, within the following hours he desperately tried to contact His colleagues from Palau who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his reports were presented with one gray glob, not two blues.
“This means that the messages have not been delivered”, he considers.
Opening theft of $26,750 while serving as a banker in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, the criminals stole $26,750, from the Brinks incubator, who manages a banker in the city of Newporton Livia, says in a press release by the Newport Police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of a armored microbus collected cash from a banking plant located in an entertainment complex and planned to fill it with new bank notes.
During this time, Brlink's staff came running in the back and stole a bag of bank notes to refill the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the New York Police Office, No. 859-292-380.
Kanye West, a rapper changed his name to Yi
Repper Kanier West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced on Saturday in Twitter: “The personal identity that has previously been known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old West has long been wearing this pseudo character and has even placed it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news of this appears in the run-up to Kanye's arrival in the Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will speak instead of Ariana's singer, who cancelled his participation because of “emotional experiences”, reports the author of the communication.
The West had previously stated that the pseudo-random not only was a reduced version of its name but also had a religious meaning.
“Ye — the most common word in the Bible — means ‘you’, ’ ‘you’, ’ ‘you, ’ ” thus West explained the title of his album in one of the recent interviews with Big Boy radio broadcaster.
"That's what I am, that's you, I'm us.
First came Kanye, which means “one, ” and now I’m only Ye, a reflection of all the good, bad, unintelligible things in us, just right away.
The album is an attempt to understand who we are."
Kanye is not the first known rapper to choose to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Diddy, Py Diddy or just Diddy, asked to call himself Love (Love) or Brassa Love or Love Brother.
The West rapper J-Zi also changed his name several times: with a defis and without, with capital letters or solid letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
President Andreas Manuel López Obádor of Mexico vowed never to use military force against civilians in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which resulted in a bloodthirsty confrontation.
President López Obrador, speaking on the island of Tlatelolco on Saturday, promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On this site, on 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration, students were first shot at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people, followed by an increase in the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship to study and the opening of more free State universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning led young people into a criminal world.
IIA development funding needs to be doubled
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (II) should not be underestimated; the United States should double investment in its scientific development, believing that Li Kaifu, investor and enterprise in the development of IIA with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several United States ministries have made earlier declarations on the work on IIA, although in general the United States does not have a clear development strategy for IIA.
At the same time, China had submitted its own plan last year, with its goal of becoming the first in the IIA innovations by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for the IIA research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in the IIA,” says Lee.
The increase in funding could double the chance that the next major achievement of the FIA would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, The Superintendents of artificial intelligence: China, the Kremlin Valley and a New World Order, was published this month by Hougton Mifflin Harcourt, Director-General of the Synovation Vetures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Faced++.
In the 1980s, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence at the University of Carnegie, which was the highest player in the United States of America, and then led by Microsoft Research and the President of the China branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technological contests, for example, the Robotics Callenge Agency Defense Advisory Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with innovative thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that devours academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that parking cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence for the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides scientists with funding similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to United States researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li points out.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence had established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence, with partners from industry and academia to participate, and the White House had announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on artificial intelligence.
During this month, DARPA announced investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the study of IIA.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which had sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artive Intellectuals, had not been taking any action in that regard for several months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
In Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “The Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would permit the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece that had blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and EU.
In June, both Governments entered into an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but the opponents of the nationalist states that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott had questioned whether the voter appearance would be equal to the 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Giorgivsky, who lives in Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The change in title will require a two-thirds majority vote of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, it was only 16 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, an electorate from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Duško voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the question of a change in the name of the country that would open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scene, setting up chairs in front of tents set up by the citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We're for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a high-level head, rather than round the thresholds of the office,” says Kawadark.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was so needed in that country, with unemployment rates of more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be for more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaw stated after the vote.
He believes that the positive answer will be “the guarantee of our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, but this is below the required appearance.
Another survey conducted by the Telecom-TV Macedonian Channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote in Sunday.
70 per cent of this quantity claims to have voted positively.
For the referendum to take place, there should be a 50 per cent plus one vote.
The collapse of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero, of Manchester City, walks around the Bryton protection to kill a bare
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sternling broke up with Bryton protection, bringing Manchester City to victory with an account of 2:0 on Saturday at the Téshad stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit his head for 65 minutes, it seemed that he had no work to do.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three Briyton defenders before going out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He turned around one defender and drove a few more around the border of the Brayton penal zone.
Then he handed Sterning to the left.
An English attacker, in a fine zone, turned Aguero's ball back in one touch, and the right leg hit the Brayton Gate, Matthew Ryan, in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” said Professor Manchester City, Pep Guardio.
“We agreed that it would be playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit a needle at that moment."
But it was Sternling that gave the Sky Club an initial advantage in the struggle against the Prime League.
That one was killed for 29 minutes.
At that game, Aguero received a ball, deep inside Briyton
He gave an excellent cut through the left flank to Leroy San.
Sana took a few hits before giving Sterling a pass on his long trouser.
The attacking Sky Blue killed the ball in the gate just before it flew out of the field.
Manchester City had a fight with Heffhenheim in the League champions' group on Tuesday at 12:55 on Rhine-Nekkar-Areen in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherther's going to take points from Collaro Roquis.
After Washington Nationals left the battle for his tribe, there was no particular reason to force events.
But an insatiable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colrado Roquis on Sunday, but only if the Roquez game, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dogers game in the West Virgin, will cause problems in the Pleaf game.
The victory of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evenings, Rockiz, has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to have a title in the first video.
“Even though we do so, we can at least retain positions knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of audiences and other teams is probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?"
Nationals has not yet announced a pilot on Sunday, but recent data indicates that in the current situation it is likely to leave Sherzer to do so.
Sheerser, going out on the 34th game, threw the ball on Thursdays in the cave for the cakes, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'll be a pizzar.
Washington's right-wing statistics, 18-7, rated ERA 2.53 and 300 auts in 220,2/3 innings during the current season.
Trump holds a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections, the President referred indirectly to the situation concerning Brett Kavano, the candidate put forward by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important, I don't run, although I'm really running everywhere fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical group of democracies, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to return to power by any means they may need, and we have seen sublime and disgustingness.
They do not care who they will harm, through whom they will cross, in order that they may receive power and control, and that is what they want.
The democracies, he claims, were committed to fighting and obstructing.
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, “the democracies are evil, mean, foolish and false.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which had caused loud calls from the hall.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Did you miss the contents of this document?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
"No, no, the tongue of the flesh has given it away, and I have never seen the tongue of the body so disprove."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse organization.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party offered me a bit of mistrust, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last member of Parliament of a Labour Party to whom we have not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
The same attitude toward my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe, ironically, are issues on which Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham East Labourist Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time, of the eight years of my tenure as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were similar.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not correspond to those many meetings, but the promise of a more human and soft policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that the Labour Party did not distinguish between views is becoming increasingly clear, and each view is assessed whether it was acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and positions that I would never have agreed with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly — it is not important that I say that — in social networks, there should be a tyranny of insults calling for the abolition of elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments to my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those my colleagues who face daily attacks on sexual or racist grounds but never drift away.
The most disappointing fact in this policy is that the number of insults has become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer the common church, and with every sense of mistrust or change of rules of choice, the party is becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I've received many recommendations calling for me to sit down and talk low, and then I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not what I came into politics.
Since I joined the Laboures 32 years ago as a student of a school who has been resentful of the Government of Tetcher, which has caused my school class to break down, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether the work of a local deputy or of a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and I have not done so in the last election.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who have supported this occasion on Friday, I would like to say that our country is going so hard to move towards Brexit, which is guaranteeing economic, industrial and state degradation, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I'd like to address is not Notttingham Momentum, but my voters, whether or not they're labourists, I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat to eliminating election results or political utility will prevent me from acting as I think it is necessary for you to do.
Chris Leslie, a member of Parliament from Notting East District
Er 38 - 17 Melrouse: Unconquerable Air
Two late attempts may have been somewhat distorted by the final outcome, but, without a doubt, Air earned triumph in this amazingly interesting Prince Tennessee match.
They are now headed by a table, the only inflexible team of dozens.
After all, all due to their superior protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, gave Peter Merci the host team and coach the full right to be content.
"All this time, we've been checked for strength, and we're still unconvincing, so I don't have any reason to be sad," said Peter Merci.
Robin Christy, Melroise, "There's a lot to pay tribute to Air," they tried better than us."
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson by Fraser Climo resulted in an Air forward, but a yellow card from the Scottish player Rory Hughes took hold of an unrealized attempt by Jason Baggott.
Climo increased the Ehr off from a fine before, right in the middle of the game, it got a point, and then after a break, it was done with a single attempt, making an account 17-5 in favour of Er.
But Meloza started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to do the Baggott reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the severe trauma of Ruard Knott, who was overstretched, and after a second break, Air moved further thanks to the Klimo attempt by Staffor McDauela.
The current captain, Claire McFerson, then received a yellow card, and again Melrose, forced the rivals to pay another player for the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the violent pressure period.
Nevertheless, the hosts returned, and when Straan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the fine line, McFerson made a dishaun behind the offensive Er.
The climo had the advantage, without stopping almost from the very beginning, after Kyle Row had been hit by David Armstrong and sent an emergency attacker, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt of the landowners.
The Still Game Star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
The Star of Still Game Ford Kiran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it is known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he's writing to, and is filming with a long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Doutt announced that the forthcoming ninth series would be the last on the show, and it looks like Cyrnan is planning life after Craiging.
According to official information, he is Director Adriftmorn Limited.
Axter refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source had suggested that Cyrnan was planning to participate in the “bright restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“More ours: the landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will again open the way for the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are hung in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are characterized by a slogan: “Theory is our right.
To return it is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked is still alive in the memory of Chile ' s coast lost as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to resources; it is alive and eager to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia looks forward to the decision of the international court to be held on 1 October, as a result of five years of debate.
“ Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and balance of mind and, of course, is looking forward to a positive outcome, ” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzaly.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice ' s decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that after decades of intense negotiations Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia ' s sovereign sea-lock.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is fighting for re-election in the following year, also looks forward to the decision to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he claimed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that, if so, it will make little difference.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to control the Chilean territory and has already stated that there will be no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgement of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard, the case “was not difficult”, says Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not moved for the past four years, but it has been delayed all the time.
“The foreign administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” says Zarat.
She said that the military rhetoric of Morales had destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions thereafter.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the judgement of the court was rendered too quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance “to end 139 different years of mutual benefit”, he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees with the fact that Morals, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, is using the naval problem as a political goat.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he claims.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to move through our past”.
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rí Young Ho states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Saturday Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly meeting.
He called on the United States to honour the pledges made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as United States Secretary Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of the resumption of the impasse in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong in Singapore.
Ri argues that long-term sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever be used by the North on their knees as a utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Pyongyang has taken substantial steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But the scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to view as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive head coverings that promise to appear in the media and they'll be carried right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or to be completely shielded from the sun, there's no need to look for anything else.
Valentino and Thomas Browne designers presented a mass of unusual head cleaners that are part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to the fashion week in Paris.
This summer, extremely inefficient hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snowballs to the podium.
A different version of Valentino: the main runway, decorated with broad, feather-like fields, was painted on the heads of the models.
Other massive axasurs included ornamented with the precious stones of ambus, the hat of the magician, and even the pineapple, but all of these head coverings are not designed to warm the head in the cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these sands had their mouth shut, and they were more reminded of Hannibal Lector’s portrait than of the coke.
One copy of the reminder is a submarine - lined plumage with tube and protective glasses, and the other is a flat ice cream.
If you're a fashion fan, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into mass sales — right to you.
Large-sized hats go to the five "La Bomba", a straw hat with two feet wide, which was already placed from Rianna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cartoon label, which produced this extremely inefficient hat that won so much popularity in social networks, produced and sent to walk on the podium of another huge anxessum — a straw beach bag almost as big as the merchant’s model.
The orange bag of a roasted peacock with a white leather handle and a refrigerated cloth became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Rivira SS19 collection on the Paris Edit Week.
Luk Armitage, a Selebrittist, explains your publication: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the media the next summer, because the designer has made their works, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge axesis."
John Edward: The knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools continue to be a tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the results of the examinations have demonstrated individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social and educational disciplines.
These schools are located in the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, and are seeking to provide a higher level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for higher education, their careers and their status as citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for developing and implementing the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, you will turn to his heart."
This is a clear indication that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with and trust citizens of other countries.
As a result of the latest examinations this year, we see the languages taking precedence in the tables of the league and having the highest points of the examination in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest “A” rating.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in the Mandarin language (Darnese language), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that foreign languages are clearly considered vital to children and young people in the future at independent Scottish schools.
At present, language subjects have the same demand as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A poll conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for employers ' difficulty in filling job vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
In view of the fact that better jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Whatever profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, he will in the future gain a real advantage by learning another additional skill that will benefit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitively.
According to the YouGov survey, in which more than 4,000 British adults participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language sufficiently to support the conversation, while French became the only language with a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent of respondents say it.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of countries with developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, there is a wide range of languages that are taught, each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools are concentrated in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important languages for Britain in the light of the country ' s future development until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of a number of languages with teaching staff who are members of these languages.
Scottish independent schools seek to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in the global business environment remain vital for the country ' s future development, and this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, which ensures diversity and benefits for Scottish youth.
I'll tell you what you're doing.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debates the Lakes on Sunday in San Diego
The gruesome expectation of fans to see Lebron James go to Los Angeles Lakes for the first time has almost reached its end.
The Laukers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play in the pre-Seson Sunday match against the Danver Naggetts in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how long it has to be won.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” said Walton at the official Lakers website.
Mike truddell's reporter wrote in Twitter that James would probably play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-session games in the Lakes schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-session games to prepare for the season,” answers the player.
Trump's first race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings of the Trump next week, including his visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the nomination proposed by him for the post of Supreme Judge has been postponed, Trump seeks to obtain support in the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote is to take place in November.
How long will the Trump meet in West Virginia tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
The meeting with Trump in Uiling, Western Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube live.
Tramp is likely to speak at the hearing this week for the nomination of his candidate, Britta Kawano, for the post of Chief Justice, and the proposal by Trump to that candidate has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken in the Senate will be postponed until the week before the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the republicans who are going to the November elections to grow up in a pre-election pace.
Thus, President Trump's campaign aims to ensure that the five meetings to be held next week help to “act the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“Contrast of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, since we are entering a busy pre-election era, ” explains the press secretary of the Trump election campaign who refused to be called Reuters.
The action scheduled for today at Wesbanco Arena in Uiling can attract supporters from "... Ohgayo and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the St. Petersburg media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
The West Virginia Tramp visit on Saturday was the second visit to that state in the last month, for it was where it had the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is behind the interviews.
“The fact that, in order for Morris to get ahead of the survey competitors, the president must come is the best sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia (Reuters Citer).
Ryder's Cube 2018: United States Conquest shows willingness to fight and provides hope by going to couples on Sundays
After three unilateral sessions, a Saturday two-by-two game may have been exactly what Rider's Cup needed.
The transition initiative is an exceptional sport concept, but it is believed by the players, and in such competitions it is particularly vivid.
So who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage in six points, and now four, so I suppose it was a small initiative,” said Jordan St.
Of course, Europe has a four - point advantage, and another twelve on the horse.
The Americans, according to the Cup, feel the wind in the sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit on high, not least because of the form of the Capita and Justin Thomas playing together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Sleeping was an ongoing habit from you to the granny than was a personal example.
The winners were getting more loud as his round continued, firing a crucial ball in the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas stepped two by two.
His strike, which gave him victory in the 15th hole game, was met with a similar reaction, one of what they say about his belief in the chance for the American team.
“We need to meet with all our energies and focus only on our game,” Spit commented.
That's all the players are left.
Walk 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more glasses over the past two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Mollinari and Tommy Flitwood, undeniably Kutka Rider's story.
A strange but charming couple in Europe have beat four out of four, and they do not seem to know the mistakes.
Molaud was the only couple who didn't get a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and their energy seems to circulate between them and non-church fans, strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun lies behind the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player who built up a potential victory for Europe than for Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both were together on different moons.
However, speaking of the glory of Europe is now premature.
Bouba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Sergio Garcia, the morning game hero of four, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
The gods and two double gods in the first nine holes had dug out a Spaniard and hung a hole from which they had never been able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
So it's exciting to watch the games in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the pairs, the councils they exchange, and which are deliberately ignored, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
To date, Europe has played better like a team, and it has been much ahead of the last day, but this session of the four has also shown that the United States of America has every effort to fight in which some have doubted, particularly in America.
On the final day of Cuba Rider, Europe runs the 10-6 account
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Rider Cup after the Saturdays are completed in four balls and fours with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet, Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari, led the fight against two victorys over Tiger Woods, to bring the bill to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, wishing to recover the loss of Hazeltina two years ago, dominated the mistake of the American team in the morning games of four balls by winning the 3-1 account.
The United States won two matches more resistance in the Quartet, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the account.
Jim Ferick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novictoise to win four consecutive rounds, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname Mulwood after a sensational weekend, became only the second couple that won four points in the first four matches in the Cuban Rider's history.
Woods and Patrick Reed's four ball wrecked, and then they were greatly united to win the fight over the spirit of Wood and the American newman Brison Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woodes, who was the last two Saturdays, showed up on periodic flashes, but now he's lost 19 out of 29 games into four balls, and four are seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was back in front of the four-wheeled morning game, returned to the partner, Henrik Stanson, in the Quartet, after winning Danstein Johnson and Brooks Kepku with the first and third seats in the world.
For Europe, however, the game did not become an easy and pleasant strolling day south-west of Paris.
The three-fold championship, Jordan St. and Justin Thomas, on Saturday, two points were a guide to the Americans.
They made a decisive victory with the Spaniards' account of John Ram and Ayan Polter playing four balls and returned later to play Polter and Rory Mackilroy with a four-thirds account, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cup Rider, the team got off the back of four points, leaving alone, given that Ferka's team, as the masters, had to play nothing to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack appears on Sunday as if it were behind their possibilities.
North Korea said that “categorically” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions were exacerbating mistrust towards the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ry Yong Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as cessation of nuclear and missile testing, dismantling of a nuclear test and the commitment not to build up stockpiles of nuclear weapons and not to develop nuclear technology.
“There is no symmetrical reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“There will be no confidence in the US in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able unilaterally to take the first step in disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the North Korean complaints already raised against Washington's “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement was considered important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Ein and Donald Trump at the first historic summit between the current U.S. President and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to begin a movement towards the “denuclearyization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea was seeking to officially conclude the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States had stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
D.C. also resists calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“U.S. insists that “the stomach must be denuclearized” and increase pressure through sanctions in order to enforce its objective and even oppose the ‘war declaration’”, says Re.
“The assumption that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that the continuing sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the U.S. leader at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhe Inh over the past five months and added: “If the question of denuclearization were part of South Korea, not of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse”.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when he said in the UN Genassim that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after the “Mr. President of the Evil” Trump named Kim as “Sam's suicide fighter”.
This year at the UN Trump, which last year threatened to destroy North Korea fully, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not indicate any time-frame for this process: “It would be two years, three years or five months that would not matter”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage the Pyongyang to take the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary, Mike Pompeo, stated in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council must continue actively and on a mandatory basis until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to overlap the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the United Nations Henassabli Summit screens and reported after that meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Phenyan, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea had condemned him for the “Bundi claims”.
North Korea promised, at a meeting with Moon this month, to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, accepts “the appropriate measures”.
According to Kim, he told him that the “conforming measures” he had mentioned were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to rest in special courses
The new course introduced this year at Harvard University has helped all students in primary school to learn how to sleep more and to combat the chavinist culture of the unceasing consumption of caffeine in order to keep on the night of summer.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chasler, a sleep professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brighham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was upset at the idea of introducing such a course, first making a report on the impact of sleep shortages on the learning process.
"At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, "I'm sorry that I'm only aware of this now that I'm almost finished."
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me," he said.
The first class offered this year describes how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the overall feelings of the individual.
Paul Barrey, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the Health Service of the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been discovered that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
The occupation takes one hour, and students perform a number of interactive assignments.
In one section of the class, it provides an image of a room in a room where students, using coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books, receive information on how each action and substance — coffee, light that causes sleep shortages — affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The on-line map of the campaign encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a false sense of pride for a person's ability to “spire all night,” still quite common, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, meant that sleep deprivation was becoming a problem.
He said that a sufficient amount of sleep in good quality is a student's secret weapon to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to deal with weightless weights, as sleeplessness makes the brain go hungry, constantly feeling hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californiaan student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course by visiting one of the classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campaign.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to undertake a similar training programme before attending a competitive training institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students identify an alarm clock to sleep and wake up, as well as to remember the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps that violate human biotics and cause sleep problems.
Livelingstone 1-0 Rangers: Hall Menga wins the team of Gerard
Rangers survived another sad retreat, as Bole Dolly Menga led Stephen Gerrdard's unsolicited team to attack account 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Aybrox team was hoping to gain its first victory after victory with an account of 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team for eight points behind, giving it a slight victory to Harts, the leaders of the Scottish Prime League.
Menga killed seven minutes before the break, and Rainers, who had lost the power of the spirit, did not seem to have planned to level the bill.
While the Rangers now came to the sixth place, the Livingston rose to a third place, giving only the Cubans the proportion of heads killed.
And Rangers may have more problems after the line judge Kalmu Spencer has had to heal his head after a subject was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard replaced eight of the team that passed through the Air in a semi-final for the Scottish League's Cup.
Holt, in turn, followed Livi strategy 11, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-wroteed composition made his opponents sick at every step.
Rangers may have been in possession of the sword, but Livingston has been pushing far more when the ball hits them.
They were supposed to kill a naked man in only two minutes when Menga Scott Pitman's first gear stopped Allan McHigor, but the half-guard took advantage of the opportunity.
Kihan Jacobs was fined Captain Craig Huckett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to send the ball to the far side of his trouser.
Rangers took over control, but the last third seemed to have more hope than their belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he was supposed to strike a fine for forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lowes met, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the Colombian statement.
Rangers did only two strokes in the first Tayme, but the former warlord of Aybrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassana Kulibali's head, and the weak blow of Ovi Ejaria.
Although the first Head of Livi, killed for 34 minutes, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserve it solely with their own hard work.
But again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' game of standard status.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson the ball, who tried hard to send the ball to Menga to finish.
Gerard began to act at a break when he changed Kubali to Ryan Kent, and the replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme half-guard gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly failed from his line to the interception.
But Livingston continued to involve visitors in the game they intended to play with Litgo and Hulkette, constantly making long transmissions.
Holt's team was trying to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGurgor was able to block Jacobs before Litgo gave off the field.
The emergency player Rangers, Glenn Middton, again demanded a fine shot after he faced Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Geiger counter detector
And now the page of our Almanah on the Star of the Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, was born in Germany on that day by a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm “Gens” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity — invention, which eventually resulted in the development of a device known as Geiger counter.
As a foundation for science, Geiger’s counter has also become one of the pillars of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s’s “Coloco Coronado” film with the cowboy-like Roegers and Dale Evans — seemingly different from the scientists — in their primary role:
Man: "What the hell is this?
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans, "That's right now.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to see an abnormal cell
A new anti-circuit vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize the abnormal cells
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and modify them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, the cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then the cells have to be zero again.
Probation vaccines show promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who had been introduced to the vaccine and whose immune system had been trained to recognize abnormal cells, whose eggs cancer had been remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, where the modified cells can “see” the whites HER2, which are characteristic of many cancers, and then the modified cells are re-entered to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzosski, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Bethlehem, Maryland, states: “Results we've received seem to have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzosski explains: HEER2 “has been developing several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and barrematic cancer.
A similar method has been successfully applied to leukemia, which involves the removal of immune cells from patients and their “teaching” of cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance at SPL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was renovated during a Saturday concert where he spoke in defense of President Donald Trump of the United States, claiming that he would reoccupate in 2020.
Following his third song, entitled “The City of Ghost”, which he described as “We Will Do America Great Again”, the executive spoke against the democracies and supported Trump.
"I often talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," said the perpetrator.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavano before the Senate Judicial Committee for the statements of Christina Blace Ford on sexual harassment.
On television, the crowd was upset at West’s comments, but the video was downloaded by a comet named Chris Roek.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They came to see me behind the stage.
They say you don't get out of that cap.
They were really kidding me!
Whistington Examiner quotes him as saying, "And they also said that my position is not cool."
West continues: “Do you want to know that it is not cool to wear a coat of superman so that no one can tell you what to do, and do you want peace to continue?
Then you need love."
His comments at least twice attracted the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL actor seemed to be lost, and one person said: “The whole studio is in silence”.
West was invited last moment to replace the singer, Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by the execution by the West of the song "I Love it" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Kenice Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the most courageous men: A SPACE FOR A MONEY.”
The leading Tok-shaw Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that West was simply “who he is, and this is absolutely remarkable”.
“However, I do not want to support anyone who, in my opinion, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
As do we,” she said.
Before the show was started, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formed known as Kanier West.”
He's not the first artist who changes his name and walks in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Paff Duddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, Repper Snape Doug, originally had the name Snape Lyon, and as another example, of course, the artist who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges because of the night at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his female visitors died of knife wounds on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Balíkhakomora, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harington's Starves on toxic disguises
Kit Harington is known for his role as the slamming sword of John Snow in the cruel medieval phentist series HBO, “The Games of the Thrones”.
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor strongly criticized the characterization of the Macho, saying that such characters often make young people think that you must be cruel if you are to be respected.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture said that he believed that something had gone wrong and wondered how to address the problem of toxicity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married a member of his throne game, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he was “all unevenly interested” in the problem.
“I take the question very seriously, where did we get the wrong sense of courage?” asked the actor.
"Why do we teach the grown-ups that we have such a problem to date? "
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for this surge of toxic courage due to too muscule characters.
Axter continues: “What is congenital and what is acquired?
What is it about television and the street that makes young men feel that they have to show only one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, really, something's wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any game of thrones or skates after the serial ended the next summer, stating that he had “concluded with greetings and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a central role in the newly photographed “The Truth West” of Sam Shepard, who tells of the producer of the film and his brother, the robber.
Axter recently announced that he believed that meeting his wife Rose was the best final of the throne games for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and life,” says the actor.
Rose played Igris, an object of the passion of character Kit John Snow in the phentist series awarded to Emma’s award.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who have contracted HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, there are more than 820,000 people suffering from these diseases in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, reflecting a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost reduced to zero, and Chinese health representatives reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in China ' s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
Research confirms that because of the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is at the expense of insufficient protection for these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to medicines against HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waterers refutes the leaking of information on the responsibility of Republican party senators, complaining about “haunty lies” and “theories of the conspiracy”
The U.S. Member of Parliament, Maxine Waterers, on Saturday, rejected the allegations that one of its employees had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia' pages.
Democracy from Los Angeles claims that claims were faked by “right-wing” experts and websites.
“Silver, lies and lies are all the more false, ” reports Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person on the Capitol hill during hearings with the Senate Commission on allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators were questioned by Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the message had been linked to Waters' office and published information about Waters staff, reports Hill.
“This unfounded claim is totally false,” assures Waters.
“My staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent acts, were in no way responsible for the diversion of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally a lie.”
Waterers' statement immediately caused criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flesher.
“It’s an angry denial, ” writes Fleecher.
“This means that the author has a temp that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're charged with something you didn't do, why are you angry?
You don't need to justify yourself either.
And you shouldn't dig in the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold."
Fleixer seemed to compare his reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waterers in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important, ” he writes.
In his statement, Waterers writes that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent acts.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and to each of my staff.”
Johnny Inkish strikes again — the weak parody of Roen Atkinson's spy.
Today it has become a tradition of searching for the meanings of Brexit in any new film in which Britain is in one way or another; it also refers to the new parody spying press, Agent Johnny Inglin, which began back in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny Ingly: Overloading.
Is this a self-aronistic picture with the leitmotivator, "it is obvious that we're all shit" with a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the punctuated profanity of Johnny Inglish with a rubber face has received his right to chaos for the second time — his name seems to indicate that it is a wide-ranging comical creation designed for the non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his amazing claims for glomerulus, got some Clouseau, the devils of Mr. Bin, and the breakup of this guy who made one single note in the Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the Olympic opening ceremony.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played the empty Barclaycard television ad that left the hero completely in chaos.
This last issue of JE has one or two nice moments.
I really liked the scene where Johnny Inngsley was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armores, and the blades were blowing through his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson to the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely overrun, especially since “serious” films such as Agent 007 and the Mission are now unimplemented, are now strongly offering the comedy as an element.
It's such a sense that the humor is designed for children, not adults, and for me, the amazing atrocities of Johnny Ingles are not so resourceful and appropriate as the Atkinson freaks in Mr. Bine's films.
The permanent assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker has entered the super-separate British network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, and the horror of the real agent, Kevin Eldon, has unfortunately taken on an epidome role here.
This is the last-ever cap for the Prime Minister, an impotent and stubborn figure who is already suffering from huge political indifference: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can to the Kwasie-Tezie-Mai character, but there's nothing to do with the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to withdraw someone from the resignation.
And it's actually Johnny Ingny's own peach who's now working as a school teacher in some kind of a pontifical institution, but it also provides informal lessons on secret operating: there's some good jokes here, because Inglynja offers the skills of a spy academy in the Rock style.
Ingish is returning to Whitehall for emergency training, and will be reunited with his former undivided friend, Buff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Baf is now a married man under the submarine commander, the role of the “joicing hockey” in which Vicki Pepperdin is slightly lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in play because there are terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's secret service, and they're faced with a beautiful rock woman named Ophelia Bullet for Olga Curilenko's performance.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the spell of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the vicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Buff start their farce: waitressed as waitressers, they burn a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves into Volta's luxurious yacht; Ingly creates a complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality garrison to get to know Volta's interior.
All of these scenes are, of course, a nice and boring idea, but there's something very childish about that.
Totally moderate.
And like with other movies, Johnny Ingles, I couldn't help but think, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly commensurate with his talent?
Labourists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the work week of Britishs to four days per five-day salary
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, is going to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive payment in five days.
The Party is reported to want company leaders to give savings workers, as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, an additional weekend.
This would enable staff to enjoy three days of weekends for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea of “attacking” on the Party's economic agenda and that it would help the people of the country to become workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the adoption of a four-day work week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
The Sunday Times said that the policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is in line with the Party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy”.
The Labour Party was not the first to support that idea, since the Green Party had promised four days of work during its electoral campaign of 2017.
However, this commitment is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not seen as a party”.
The Shadow chanceller John McDonnell used a conference of laborists last week to specify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to break out of power with the “no-one directors” and “skillers” of the utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders may not be able to recover all their share, since the Labour Government can make “discretions” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company directors ' boards and establish funds, Inc., to transfer 10% of private sector capital to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to Pound500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavana changes their opinion
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Britt Kavano delayed the final vote on his appointment to a senior judge for a minimum week and asked whether the findings of the agency could encourage any of the repudiators to support Kavano.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelli, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” replied Kennedy.
“I went to the meeting and said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
And I called him after that, and I got this information, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
His answer was decisive and clear.”
But Graham's opinion in the voting remains unreserved.
“I have made a firm determination about Britta Kawano, and my opinion can be changed only by argument, by the force of action comparable to that of a dynamic,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I do know is, Britt strongly denied these things," added Graham, turning to Christine Blace Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses was able to confirm these facts either.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I have not seen anything new in it."
What is Global Capital Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York, will be Global Capital Festival Festival, an annual musical event involving an impressive starry composition with an equally impressive mission, an end to global poverty.
For the seventh year, as tens of thousands of people in the Festival of the World's citizens, they have been on the big meadow of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the presentations of the perpetrators such as Janet Jackson, Kardy B and Sean Mendez, as well as to describe the present objective of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World's citizens' faith, which was opened in 2012, is a continuation of the global project against poverty, which is being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for an event (if you are not prepared to pay for VIP tickets), you were required to participate in volunteer activities or to send an electronic letter to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the State of the World's Citizens been in achieving its goal in 12 years?
Is it just another case of so-called “concessionalism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing online and by sending messages in Twitter?
Global Citizen's organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” have been held by its supporters, who have pursued many different goals.
It is recalled that these actions led world leaders to pledge more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group presented 390 commitments and declarations that had been made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The team estimated that nearly 649 million people around the world directly benefited from allocated funds.
One of the most significant commitments is the Conseil of Nutrition: the British Investment and Innovation Partnership, committed to helping children to achieve their full potential, pledged 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help put an end to malnutrition in the county, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Commissions.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Cities, such as you, we can make social injustice in the lack of food of the past history,” said Ambassador Peter of Nutrition Tracy Wallman of London’s live concert in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced the funding of the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the many questions asked on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global forumers say, "It will be a long and difficult way for us to stumble and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great movements of the struggle for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Jeanel Mone are some of the artists who will attend this year's event in New York and will be led by Deborah-Le Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a naval fleet for “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke said that Washington could be “as necessary” used to help its naval fleet to prevent Russian energy sources from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy in the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And according to the official, there are some ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, in conjunction with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, blockade against their power to the market”, says the Minister.
Zinke addressed an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that views itself as “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington ' s approaches to Russian and Iran, noting that they were virtually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and substitution of fuel”, says the Minister, calling Russia “ponsium with one trick”, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump administration had made an effort to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsolicited” “North Stream-2” project that, according to Trump, made Berlin “Plank” Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly emphasized that the “North Flow-2” project worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's violent resistance to the project is economic and is an example of unfair competition.
“Concluding that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister Alexander Nowak, after meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in September in Moscow.
The United States position led to a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the German Federation (BDI), called on the US to keep away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our supply of energy, it is a serious problem, ” said Dr. Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting of Chancellor Angel Merkel of Germany and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will examine carefully the possibilities of running for the presidency in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that he would study carefully the possibilities of running for the post of President after the interim elections.
During a meeting of the city duem in Holiook, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think of participating in the electoral race.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and to clean up our broken government, and this needs a woman upstairs," says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I shall consider carefully the possibility of running for Presidents.”
Warren so much appreciated the activities of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “to lead the district in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned before the bone brain that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open criticism both of Trump himself and of his candidate for the post of Chief Justice Britt Kawano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to conduct an investigation into the FBI before we proceed to vote.”
However, a Thursday poll showed that the majority of voters did not think that it was due to run in 2020.
According to a survey of the Safolk University Political Studies Centre/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts's “silver” voters stated that the senator should not be allowed to vote.
On the contrary, thirty-two per cent of respondents supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Delal Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections, and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names of the democracies discussed in the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Baiden claims that he will take a formal decision on January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told us about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traka Paylin in a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peylin called his arrest a “whitefold in the eye” and said of his son and other veterans of war: “They are returned by others who are trapped, asking if there is the same respect for their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other military they have offered to their country”.
Pailin was arrested on Monday at Vassil, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, in a situation involving violence and the possession of weapons in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a member of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 States, Colombia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteenth states and districts of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of flight or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 state and district representatives filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C. by a court consultant on the support of asylum-seekers challenging policy.
The American Civil Liberties Union's full name in the case of Grace v. Sessiones in August against federal politics is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband, “and his sons in a criminal group”, ill-treated her, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace indicate that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala offer large numbers of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without documents that escaped domestic violence.
The Director-General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “has ignored decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of action, and this prohibition violates this principle,” states a court consultant’s report.
Counsel also claims that policies prohibiting immigration are detrimental to the U.S. economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “makes the necessary labour force”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sachens ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or banditry violence.
“The refugees will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” said Sachns in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue people to Palm: double the number of survivors in search of survivors
The situation for survivors has become more difficult.
“It is now very difficult, ” says 35-year-old Ris Kusum, who had comforted his sick child at the evacuating centre of the destroyed town of Palm.
“Each minute ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water in large scarcity.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including the Duves, who had a bone and shoulder fractured, rested at the Palu army hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the room because of the continuing strong crowd.
He weeps, remembering how a severe earthquake broke the hotel number on the fifth floor that he filmed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was squeezed into the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife scream, ask for help, and then calm came.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're saved and they're all right now.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “inheritances” through “advertising advertisements”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in the United States daily publication describing the mutual benefits of US and Chinese trade, the United States Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the payment of a supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial publication of the State of Iowa, in an effort to interfere with the election of the United States Congress on 6 November, which is a charge that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in US elections is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials reported to Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington's growing pressure campaign on China.
While it is the norm for foreign Governments to place advertising for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are at present in a state of escalation of the trade war, which results in their equal import tariffs for their countries.
China ' s counter tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at striking exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic Party of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter in China, claimed that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Brandad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Denines Register, “now doubles this potion by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In promoting its propaganda, the Chinese Government has taken advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and of the press, which is dear to our heart, by paying and advertising to Des Moines Register,” writes Brandstad.
“However, in the newspapers here, on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and to see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese people can learn from the disturbing economic policies of China, since the local media are under the control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had been “skinned away” from the proposal to publish his article, although it had not given a precise title to the publication.
Analysts warn: by the separation of the Republican women before the interim period
Many high-ranking republicans prefer to stand by and defend the candidature of Supreme Justice Brett Kavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming intermediate elections.
Emotions around this situation have been rioting to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue to vote.
Such things cannot be returned later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Siracusa, in his Saturday article.
Ryer is in doubt that attempts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an investigation into the FBI in the very last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, but they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors scanned the “Night Forward” against the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Bleissy Ford, reports Mic.
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the borders, ” declared a non-partisan political scientist St. Rotenberg on the news site.
"People say the situation is already quite severe, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the President, often don't vote."
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, accused him of sexual harassment, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the proposal, that step might trigger a response.
“It is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee early last week, as reported by NBC News.
“The matter is not only about voting in a committee or a final vote, or whether Kawano has sat on the dock of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans handle it as they are,” says Guy Seil, director of the Principles, USA, a group that helps to elect democracies, a news channel.
Nevertheless, Americans seem to have split up a few things about whom they still believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and slightly more tend to be on the part of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony exactly or most likely, whereas 35 percent said that they believe Kawano exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kawana is likely or definitely lied while giving his testimony, while only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
At the urging of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges put forward by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee that Kavano, in an intoxic state, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramírez claims that a high judge candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his university education in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, runs a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what kind of information to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the purpose of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We must do so now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment”.
The annex uses the Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “private online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases as well as calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools to deal with data.
It works on the same basis as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Space -- everything can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online repository is that it is entirely managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “the personal empowerment of rights through data”.
According to John Bruce's Director-General, the idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of state developers with whom the project contract is contracted, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to develop their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his companies should make dramatic changes that would make all of their business models change completely at once.
“We do not ask for permission.”
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate about neutrality over the network.
Even with Inrut, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet age,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Churchman on the Cross of Victoria during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded a cross to Victoria during World War I, and this was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for an attack on Bellenglis and Løkour.
Unfortunately, he was killed four days later by a Sniper, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial to this event was opened on Saturday by two grandchildren on the Rusden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic”, that the monument had been opened 100 years after his grandfather had received the reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Catan Canal “in a very thick fog and under strong fire, field guns and machine guns”.
He then stepped on the line of fire and, with the greatest courage, led the group forward, and then with one hand threw a left gun, and killed three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed on October 4, 1918, about a month before the end of the war.
A 72-year-old hero, Michael Vann, said that "he could hardly do the same heroically, but it humbles."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a spring at the end of the parade run by the Imperial Youth orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great privilege for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the pleasure of a genuine hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they showed Peppu lead.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellatar 206, but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
The San José table consisted of 13 fighting forces, including six major programme fighters, broadcast all night on a live television channel in Britain.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegaard Moussa and Rory McDonald were ready for the meeting, British fans were shocked to see Swink Pepa.
Some sick people didn't get that at all, because they didn't sleep until morning just to watch the fights.
One of the Twitter fans described this change in the child's video "some sick joke."
“A state order was made that, for six o’clock in the morning, the content was inadequate, so they had to switch to children’s programmes, ” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President Bellatoor on Marketing and Communications when asked why.
"Yes, Little Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they were planning to make a schedule so that in the future the fights could also be seen by the British audience.
“As far as the show is concerned, I think we can solve this issue,” says Coker.
"But there will be a Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we will not be able to resolve this issue until Sunday for our day, and it will be Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text message, and they were all far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, thinking it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that it was a matter of State importance.
I promise you that next time it won't happen that exactly.
We're going to cut down to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a cut.
Yes, it didn't work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt incomplete because of his sexual orientation
Olympian Dyver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete told me he didn't understand that “not all the likes of him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Deert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Lavern, he said he was speaking about gay rights in order to give others “hope”.
He also said that the victory at the Olympics began to disturb him less after he had a baby.
Kirst Young's permanent multi-year show, due to illness, took several months' leave.
Dalei, who was the main guest in the Lavern program, said that he felt that he was “more miserable than anyone else” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls.
He says: “To this day these feelings of worthlessness and incapacity have been very real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he meant something to not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The bilateral bronze Olympic Medicalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his statement to the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was fortunate that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
A threefold champion of the world said that the feelings of a man, the American director of Dastin Lansa Black, to whom he met in 2013 “had come to light”.
In the past year, Daly married the Oscar laureate, who is 20 years older than he is, but claims that the difference at age was never a problem.
“If your life is so young”, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a young man with the same fundamental opposite experience of life.
A couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said that “all his world views had changed. ”
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about "I need to win a gold medal," says an athlete.
"But you know what, there are things and important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011.
Daly told me that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of his latest requests was that of the first round of the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you'll be gone then, and you won't be able to sit there in the front row," says Dale.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not infallible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daly attended the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I was dreaming of all my life — to diving before a lot of compatriots at the Olympic Games — was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still loves him.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 English summer time.
Michaelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on a bench.
American Phil Mikelson will set up a record on Sunday, playing his 47th match of Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to pull up his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who played a record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürick to a bench on Saturday for four balls and four fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five-fold major winner has shared his day between playing and working on his own field game in the hope of correcting what he is concerned about.
Never had the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for a rigid Le Golf National, where the long radius usually carries an odd blow.
And if the course in itself is not sufficiently frightening, Michaelson in the ninth match will meet with an accurate British Open Francesco Molinari champion on Sunday, who joined Tommy Flitwood's note to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in 12 single matches make a bright start, Mickelson's match may be decisive.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say something else.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, shook my back, hugged my back, and said that tomorrow would be ready, ” Ferik commented.
"He's pretty sure of himself too.
He's the walking hall of glory, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't suppose he'd play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michaelson will break Nick Foldo's record by number of matches in Rider's Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in Rider's Kutke, which never corresponded to the height of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 injuries, and seven others, although Feric said that his presence was of great benefit to the team.
"He's funny, he's shy, he's smart, he likes to feed people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested," he explained.
“I think young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than play."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows in his experience that a significant single level of leadership in Cup Rider can easily turn into an adverse one.
Danish debuted at a game in 1997 in Valderram, where a team led by Northyano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over Americans, but had overcome the finish line with just a little bit of a difference, winning a 141-ffice-131-42.
"You continue to remind yourself that we have a great advantage in Valderram; we have a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we have lost, and in Valderram, where we have won, but just for now," said Bjorn, who was photographed after watching the 2018 Class, who won the field "Le Golf National" with an account of 5-3 Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 10-6 score.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
Until the glasses are placed on the plate, nothing's over.
We have a goal, and that's the chance to win the trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I've been saying, "I'm not begging, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know so well that we're against what we stand against -- against the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the way his players presented themselves on a golf field for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have given up on it.
We're going to have a different test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual statements begin, and that's quite another matter.
It's always nice to be there with your partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're going to experience all your power as a professional golfer.
It is this idea that players should be forced to make their way to tomorrow itself.
The partner is now behind, and he must make every effort too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Ferick believes that his players will act better on their own than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who recruited three of the four.
Fernique himself passed through the last few days, becoming part of a winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the “Chad in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in reply to a question about Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had played his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish this as if in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it exerts great pressure on the match in the middle.
We've built our plan on the game, and we've set the boys as we thought they were right, you know, we're going to try to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory Mackilroy in top level with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tour table.
“I have chosen such a group of boys, and in this order, because I believe that they will be able to close all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The new German warship was postponed
The new frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the cold war era, but this will not happen at least next year, due to malfunctioning systems and vinyl cost increases, reports local media.
The launch of the Royal Pfitz, the main ship of a very new frigate class at Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The ship had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
They are known to have a powerful gun, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some “stelles” technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature devices.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods, which should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the constant delay in the entry into service means that the most modern military ships, which are said to be allowing Germany to spread their power abroad, are becoming obsolete by the time they take up arms, notes Die Zeit.
The frigate frigate F125 was placed in news headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware flaws” that had made a warship useless when used in battle.
The lack of software was particularly critical, since the Baden-Württemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the workforce at the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy to reduce its productivity and to limit the ability of the WIF to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Royal Pfitz was twice as heavy as the same class used by Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training the team, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached Euro3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) after the original Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of retention on the anchor of the latest frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings to reduce Germany ' s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the naval forces were in fact “consisting the supply of ships capable of deployment”.
The manager said that the problem had deteriorated over time because the old ships had been removed from service, but they had not been replaced.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken into arms by the fleet.
National Trust hears the secret life of flying mice
A new study in one of Scotland’s buildings has the task of showing how flying mice use their landscape to find food.
It was to be hoped that the data received would allow for a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and assist in further conservation activities.
A study organized by scientists of the Scottish National Foundation will examine the common non-niotres, the non-oprano neotre, as well as the brown long hairy mice and dobantton nights of Invewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registerers will be installed in some locations around the site to monitor flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the terrain using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the screams as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
The environment map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, an expert on the conservation of NTS, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify key areas for the management of habitats, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forests that are optimal for flying mice and other related species.
Populations of flying mice in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom have fallen considerably over the last century.
They are at risk of extinction as a result of construction and mining that affect their habitat and their habitat.
Windship turbines and lighting installations may pose a danger, as well as a cliché for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and domestic cat hunting.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits are more useful than their ears when it comes to mining.
They're using a sophisticated echo-location technique to precisely identify the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, visiting checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only fly mice reserve in Scotland in the Terave site in Damfried and Galloway, where eight of the 10 species of Scottish flying mice live.
David Thompson, the real estate manager, says that the name is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, an excellent place for flying mice," he says.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees, and all aspects of a good environment.
But much about flying mice remains unknown, so the work that we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a well-being."
He recalled the importance of checking flying mice before maintenance within private power, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young persons, perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Medical mice are protected by law, their destruction, grass or destruction of their habitats are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrella, a Scottish officer of the flying mice Foundation, appeals to the public for help.
She says, "We still have much to learn about our flying mice, and we just don't know how their many separate species live."
Ronaldo denied charges of rape, and his lawyers were going to apply to the German magazine.
Krishtian Ronaldo denies the charges against him of rape, calling them felical news, and claiming that people are simply “want to drink ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to apply to the German news journal Spigel, which has released charges against the football player.
Forvard Portugal and Juvetintos was charged with rape by a American woman named Catherine Major, who allegedly took place in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, told Spigel on Friday.
Speaking in Instagram, where the football player has 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo called this information “female news”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fairy news, says a five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
"They just want to get drunk using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, to say my name, but that's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and everything's great," adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldda's lawyers are prepared to apply to Spigel for charges they called “unallowed information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the seriousness of a legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
When he met at a night club, Ronaldda and Majora allegedly returned to the game room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents presented to Clarke District Court in Nevada.
Majora claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her lap and told her that he was “99 per cent a good guy, but a 1 per cent match”.
The documents state that Ronaldda confirmed that the couple had sex, but that was by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she appealed to the police and that her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “an fear of retaliation” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change her place of residence now because she continued to experience the traumatic feelings of the incident.
Ronalddo was about to join the “Ral Madrid” from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the “Uwe” Italian giants in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain “welcomes about motorists lost forever”
The Minister of Business and Enterprise Affairs, Greg Clarke, stated that Britain would “feel it forever” if, after Brexit, the world leader for the production of cars lost his status.
He also commented on information that TOYYOUK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaton, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto-producer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job loss.
The plant in Bernaton produces Toyta Auris and Avenues, and last year it released almost 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaton.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about the withdrawal from the EU without an agreement on international trade, including in Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto-producers, in the absence of a Brexit transaction, the supply chain will be put at high risk.
The TOYT line of production shall be launched “in time” and the parts of the car manufactured for purchase shall be supplied by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a transaction on 29 March, the border may be damaged, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and deficiencies.
According to the company, Toyta will not be able to store stocks in his factory in Derbyshire for longer than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chekers plan for the Terez May plan for future relations with the EU had been “prohibited to avoid these border inspections”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will, again, not only succeed now, but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4 “The Day”.
“Not only Toyt, but other producers also claim that we must be absolutely in a position to continue successful supply chains”.
TOYT was unable to clarify the time when production would be stopped but warned in the longer term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Tswalaris, who has been in Bernaston for 24 years and who is the director of the factory trade union, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them”.
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to White House information
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be “transmitted for another week”, as the struggle for the candidate Britta Cavano continued for the post of Chief Justice, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of Robert Muller's Special Adviser, who investigates Russia's intervention in elections, links between Trump Assistants and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether Trump removed the Deputy Attorney-General from office, thereby endangering the independence of Muller, Washington, D.C., has been causing a number of speculations for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a recording wire with Trump and the possibility of presidential impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN in New York, was announced.
Trump said that he would not have wanted to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Bleis Ford testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI complaints against Kawano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
The Prime Secretary of Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, but perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court”.
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists have challenged this assertion: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to the “objection of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing in the public”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Tramp and the press.
“The President holds more meetings in response to the questions of journalists than any other president before,” she added, without bringing the exact figures, “We have those figures”.
Sanders believed that the briefings would continue, but “if there is an opportunity for the press to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me”.
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, this is a worthy replacement for the press-briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House by attending public meetings or press conferences with high-level officials.
The Conference is only a rare place for the press.
The dramatic and sometimes strange behaviour of the President before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why it is.
The Minister of Health addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland regarding concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health contacted EU officials working in the Scottish GCC to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote to staff less than six months before they left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of processing status declarations for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman writes: “In the summer negotiations between Great Britain and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the decision to be reached in autumn.
However, the British Government is also increasing preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is now, therefore, that I wish to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contributions of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi carried an emergency operation on head injury
Michael Tennsey, the Authority, reported that Christian Abercrombi's semi-defendant, a terrorist, suffered a head injury on Saturday, after having hit 31-27, at the Waderbilt Commodores match.
The chief trainer in Tennessee Rod told journalists that the trauma had been sustained shortly before the break.
“ He went to the sideline and just jumped there, ” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the plate and taking it to the medical examination.
The representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV at Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “unless there is any details about the type/stapen of the injury”, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombi, only on second course, it was the first season of Tennessee State State after moving from Illinois.
Saturday, before he left the game, he had successfully intercepted five balls, which was 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher seal fee when purchasing a real estate in Britain.
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher herb fee for the purchase of real estate in Britain, while the additional money paid will be used to help the homeless.
This step will lead to the consequences of Corbin’s attempt to attract young voters
Higher herb charges will be paid to those who do not pay a tax in Britain
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher herb fee at the purchase of real estate in Britain, and the additional money paid will be used to help the homeless — it will be announced today by Theresa May.
This step will have no effect on Corbin ' s attempt to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to raise citizens ' incomes.
The increase in herb fees would be collected from individuals and firms who did not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus paid would have to stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless persons.
The allowance for the existing herb collection, including the two-year increase for secondary and rental accommodation, can be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London real estates are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which has increased prices and made it more difficult for first-house buyers to improve their housing conditions later.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “a ghost town” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, when bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in herb fees to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of taking up real estate prices but not using land in fact, and called on Ms. May to abandon the quota of affordable housing in order to remedy the “disgusting housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and an end to unjustified evictions.
It also wishes to give local governments more power to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “I said last year that I had dedicated my Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
This includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as the labour-loving British.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too distant, and the threat to some on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My horse goal is to run Scotland."
Sunderland Club boss Jack Ross says that his ultimate goal is to become a certain stage manager of Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scottishman is enjoying the revival of the North-East Club, which is now the third largest point in the first league, separated from the first three points.
That summer he moved to State of the Right after he returned St Merren to the Scottish Prime League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a hat B, and that's it,' said Ross Sportsund BBC Scottland.
"But I grew up watching my father after Scotland in Hamden, and this always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity would come only if I could become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sunderland were also Dick Advocatat, David Moes, Sam Allardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gas Peyet and Paulo Dianio.
The former manager, Alla Athletic, says that he did not feel too sensitive to such authoritative names in such large clubs, before he turned down the Barnsley and Ipsich Toon proposals.
"For me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Prime League.
This club, by its structure and capabilities, certainly belongs to the Prime League,” says the coach.
“To get him there is not an easy task, but I will consider that I have done my job only if I can get the club back."
Ross has been serving as manager for only three years, first as Assistant Manager at Dumbarton, and then for 15 months at the Hiarts Training Staff.
Then he helped Alla to rise from the third level and in the next season, St Merren left the lower positions at the winners of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than he has ever been during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It must have been a real intersection,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that my management was more appropriate than playing.
That sounds strange, because I did everything well, did well in that post and made some progress.
But play is more difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still under pressure to work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, in doing so, I feel most comfortable like a fish in the water throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for beer pints
The summer heat has increased the sale of British pubs, but the sale of restaurants has declined.
Statistics show that sales in pubs and bars in July grew by 2.7 per cent and that restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting company that received the statistics, says: “Moving excess solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when bull sales grew by 2.8 per cent, and at restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly.”
June’s decline in income in restaurant trade of 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results, comparable to those in restaurants.
The only food-seals have also been affected by the heat of the sun, though not as much as the restaurants.
It makes me feel like people want to jump out just to skip a glass.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars rose by 6.6 per cent per month and the food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impacts of major social or sports events remain critical when it comes to sales on the non-market market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially because the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
Longer hot summers have proved more than ever to be for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, by producing more moderate temperatures, will provide a much needed shelter.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the scrapping of brands.
Monitoring of industry sales by Coffer Pach Tracker on the British sex sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry standard.
Every fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he conceals from his parents
According to the survey, 1 out of every 5 children — some only 11 years old — have secret accounts in social networks that he conceals from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools revealed an increase in PTS pages
This news has raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account known to their parents
However, 1 out of every 5 children — some just 11 years old — creates social accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid rise in the number of Inca fairs, i.e. the Intagram, a photo-sharing website.
This news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty per cent of pupils stated that they had a basic, clean account to which their parents had access, but also a secret account.
One mother, who accidentally obtained access to a secret acupuncture of her 13-year-old daughter, came across a teenager who called on others to “rape him”.
A study carried out by the Digital Security Service UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two characteristics in the social media, half of which admitted that one was usually secret.
Chapter HMC Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that's an alarming fact."
Elyd Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” of Scottish light athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eiled Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish light athletes as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete on light athletes, President Ian Beatty argues that this is a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the vast experience of athletes at the international level over the past decade.
“Alid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Human Life Community, and we are confident that its participation will be of great benefit to a light athlete in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I'm looking forward to becoming the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution to the development of sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters on the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a private commentator on BBC, and after a moved stroke, it has lost its ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter account: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I'm completely cured, I'm learning to walk and I'm doing fishing today!
Thank you very much for your support."
The milkys ’ advertisements, in which nursing moms were compared to cows, divided the opinions of Internet users
The Molotosa Company has caused a dispute over the Internet by publishing ads that compare nursing mothers with farm cows.
In the market, according to Elvie, “the world’s first silent mammotos, which can be worn, the consumer technology company, has published an ad-housing music video showing the freedom that the new breast-feeds provide to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full-time cow girl under a musical track saying, "Yes, I will feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and "If you don't notice, it's my breast."
And then the chorus is, "We bite, we feed, we feed our babies with breast milk, we feed, we feed."
This advertising video, which was published on the Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
770,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the audience, many say it sheds light on the milkhouses.
"It's a bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken from them within days of birth,” says one user.
Molocotos Elvie is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Moter)
Another comment: “It is understood that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise milk matter for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds, “Advertial ads”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great."
"I think that's a great idea.
If I fed a baby, I'd have to buy one.
Smiling really made me feel like a cow.
The ads, of course, are a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
"It's a genius product," wrote one user.
And another comment: “Corky ads based on moms who are breast-feeding (often doing this directly in their workplace or in the toilets) and who really feel a little bit like cows.
This advertisement is not to admire or destroy our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these unmarked milky milkers hidden under the brats.
The concept of this publicity campaign is based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milktros is completely insatiable, has no wires or tubes, is placed freely in a feeding gasket, while unmarked by allowing women to move, keep their young children, and even walk out of the street during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and specialist in early childhood development, says: “Molocoots Elvié is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative publicity.
Through a parallel between women and domestic cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing an incredible sense of freedom in a joking and cheerful way that gives new milkotos.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milktrops get in news headlines.
During the London week fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of the designer Marta Jakubowski using the product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained had increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively constant, partly because the rigid rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be placed in charge.
Usually, most sponsors are the same non-documented immigrants themselves and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking the child under the authority of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential holders and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, witnessed in Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to take care of the remaining minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been previously tried.
“About 80 per cent of the persons who are either the guardians or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
We therefore continue to persecute those individuals,” said Olbens.
In an effort to speed up the process of child-care, officials introduced new regulations that would require some of them to be tried within a month of detention rather than 60 days later.
In order to declare his legal status as an immigration judge, many are present by video link, not personally.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to help will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornilo, where signs that the child is in trouble are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare for or say good - bye to friends can add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Muale also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had been taking place for eight years in the country.
Mualel, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “war against terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and“any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spiratory insurance” that had caused refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens”, he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until a political agreement on the cessation of war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major pillar of the Idlib rebels provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia from targeting three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear time” agreement and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including those from Al-Qaida-related Nasr front, who would “be destroyed”.
The UN Messenger Staffan de Misur hopes that the first meetings of a new committee will soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “considering articles of the Constitution in force”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win his election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal do not prematurely complete his presidency, which is likely to be expected by many liberal spectators.
And that will no doubt be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!”
There's no sign of the weariness of the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, production ratings have more than doubled, up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times that of MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million film stars, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has exceeded the cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million spectators at night during the main news show.
“This is a fire that people are streaming to, because it’s outside our understanding,” says Neil Bair, director of the ABC “Appointed Survivor”, a member of the Cabinet who becomes President after the Capitols were destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skwell, a long-standing comedian writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about entering the Holocaust Boys Club”, offers another theory.
She remembers one day riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
He said, “That's because he's funny! ”
In all this chaos, there is something valuable — joy.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's story lines can determine the future of the Rou v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
Yet when you've been looking at a group of experts for six consecutive hours, you've been discussing the use by Bob Woodworth of the Blue Background for his book "Stach," or Paul Manafort's jacket for 15,000 dollars of ostrich skin (hopsticks warmed with pride," as Washington Post puts it), or Mr. Trump's sharp description of Storme Denis, say yes, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it's already going beyond normal awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“part of his work is to make us feel that the reality is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wehelhouse Entertainment, and the director of the Penn Stars about the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the daily turn of the story (Dr.F.L., praise Kim Jong Yin).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the northern bank of Cauai, and the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during a CNN recording.
He could not escape from the screen, at least not exactly when showing how Britt Kawano appeared to the Senate Legal Committee and how the future of the Supreme Court would be handled.
"I remember when we did all this crazy show, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outseyder money enters the largest interim elections run by the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash from the change of districts in Congress, where two officials participate in the race at the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburg, whose geography has not been changed recently, supports a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamba, who took place in another district during an extraordinary election last spring.
The Lamba opposes another current official, the Republican of Kit Rotfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely at variance with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that as a result of pre-elections, old districts had been imposed on Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has generated a heated debate on financing campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic Campaign (NCCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after the victory with a small difference in the special elections that were held in March in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts have given democracies a small advantage.
The United States ordered El Salvador to support China but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing a negative reaction by Washington.
In June, 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and he was also owned in Panama until his partners removed the Trump management team.
The representatives of the State party decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the “recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognized recognition”, declared, earlier this month, a Spokesperson of the Department of Heser Nauert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received about US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-level representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward, and had in fact stopped consideration of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will be delivered by Vice-President Mike Pens on the assumption that the Administration attaches great importance to the meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any further strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal matters subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the non-adversarial, who is part of the administration, but also spoke on an anonymous basis.
Learn History
The next step could be a presentation by the Special Adviser to Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is now very substantial evidence in public reports.
Mr. Müller was also reportedly beginning to investigate the alleged conspiracy of the Trump campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress was to change the host's office, Mr. Trump would face responsibility in that body, just as he was preparing to speak again before the voters, and perhaps eventually before the jury from among his colleagues.
But there's a lot of "if"; I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as well as the fall of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will have an impact on the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to set up a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened had the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovak forces in Munich.
However, we have not done so, and this has missed the possibility of avoiding bloodshed for years to come.
The course of history is taking place at such points, and an impermissible march of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans are going through some of these turning points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Deputy Attorney-General of Rhode Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the paper, last year he offered to keep secret records of the President's activities and reasoned on his inadmissibility for office.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the data of The Times are incorrect.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Britta Kawano is not complete or true, or if it is still confirmed as a high judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we fail to pass these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to follow them in dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-speaking Jew who had been called at Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials had once occupied an Ambassador's house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later led me to light a Saturday candle on a swastika table.

Norman Eisen, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institute, is Chairman of the Group for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of the book "The last palace: an alarming century of Europe in the history of five lives and one legendary house"
Graham Dorance of the Rangers is designed optimistically in the run-up to a collision with the Vienna Rapide football club.
The Rangers adopt the Vienna Ripid on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians, after an impressive defeat in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take up strong positions in the G-G of the League of Europe.
Travma's knee was prevented by Graham Doranza's paramonic for the first time in the season, with a figure of 2.2 against Villarreala, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a tramplin to achieve great results.
'It was a good moment for us, 'cause Villarreal is a good team,' said a 31-year-old football player.
"We went into a game, believing we could get something, and left someone.
We may have been able to do it eventually, but in general, we may have had a fair result.
They may have played a better game in the first secret, and our success has been on the second point where we have shown ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they've shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of sick people, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been a hard one, given all that has to do with my injuries and my replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautiful, and the kids are really enjoying it; the training has been done for the sur.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and succeed.”
Women are losing sleep because of fear of their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted them to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they spoke to their children on the subject.
“People want to be cared for by one of the family members but don’t try to discuss the subject with them, ” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President Nationalwood for life insurance.
It's what we need to start with.
Talking to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for what they may need to care for you unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Talk to your consultant and family, where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice may be an important factor in expenditure.
Consult with your financial consultant to help you develop a plan to pay those costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by the traditional long-term care policy or the mixed policy of monetary life, which will help to cover these expenses or to protect yourself by means of your own property, provided that you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: rid yourself of legal fables.
Provide confidence in medical care and appoint a trustee who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that the possibility of financial confidence be considered.
A trustee should be selected to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are not in a position to do so.
Remember, too: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to provide information on the medications he takes, and on what he has allergies?
Write down all these pieces on paper to make sure they're ready in case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have financial resources but also to choose doctors”.
“ What medication do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Remove and write down the plan.”
In Ifrakombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle.
On several occasions, a man fired a pneumatic rifle while returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest and hand hit the bullets, for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ifrakomb, Devon.
The police described the shooting that took place at approximately 02:30 hours in English as “loyality”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounding is not lifelong and the police are now looking for witnesses.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and a tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palm on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
As a result of the decomcom generation, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, the area north of Palm, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter by a force of 7.5 points.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated to Palm as a result of a natural disaster.
The following are some of the key facts about Palma and Donggal, on the island of Sulawes:
Palm is the capital of Central Sulawes, which is located at the end of the narrow harbor on the western coast of Sulaves, with an estimated population of 379,800 (for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
The Donghala is a district extending 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulaves.
The district, an administrative district smaller than the province, numbered 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of Central Sulawes, particularly the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important to the provincial economy, but mainly is concentrated in Mortali, the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has been devastating several times over the past 100 years in Palm and Donghal.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghal.
The tsunami also took place in western Donghal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on a Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:

Sarah Paylin's older son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Paylin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice-commandant to President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pailin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in a situation of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up a phone from her.
According to KTU, Peylin is in the Mat-Su detention centre and will be released on bail of $500.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unknowable innocence”.
Pailina faces three minor crimes of class A, which means that he can be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined for $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, falsified with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son's cruel behaviour as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.

In social media, video recordings appear with an accident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
The Federal Public Prosecutor ' s Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old truck reportedly rented a home Depot truck to attack a cycle track on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notification of the intention to achieve the death penalty in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the large federal jury read to Saipov the conviction with 22 counts of charges, which included eight killings for the purpose of reket used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “pretentiously planned and deliberate”, and Saipov carried it out, as described in the description, “responsive, cruel and criminal”.
“Syfullo Habibuljevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to his family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevez, Anne-Lor Descadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlia, Herna Ferpuci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alegand Damian Pakulco”, says a notification of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty in New York Southern District for criminal offences.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The most recent death penalty in the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Eel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy out the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenberges were executed using an electric ceiling on June 19, 1953.
According to the Saipov judicial documents, Uzbekistanan citizen has shown that there is no regret following his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to review the ISIS video on the phone.
He also requested that ISIS's flag be hung in his hospital room, reported to the police.
He denies his guilt at all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipia, said that they were “severally disappointed” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all its participants,” said Patton.
Saipov ' s defence had previously appealed to the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The member of Parliament from Tori said that NAJEL FARRAJ should not be responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during the protest at the Tori Nigel Farzor Conference, an oath was made to “mobilize the people's army”.
A former Ukip leader said that politicians should “feel” Europeans, as a member of the Parliament, Terez May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bowe's Conservator Party member told a rally in Birmingham that Great Britain would be out if Mr. Faraz had been Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, while trying to reconcile her deep-rooted ranks, is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party who are opposed to withdrawal from the EU join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The primer of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, as reflected in Chekers, in the midst of the attacks by the Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite a negative response, and thus force the Europeans and the labourists to choose between her bag and the haos.
Mr. Bown said at the Leave Means Leave (Go out for survival) in Solchilla that he wanted to play Chekers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraja should be levelled and be held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were responsible, we would have gone out, ” he said.
The Wellingborough's deputate added, "I'm going to keep fighting for Brexit, but we need to play Chekers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We wish to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 voting: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to stay is completely wrong”.
Brexit's fan of Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the meeting, giving journalists this comment: "I say: Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Ceckers are not available to the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also open to members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and choosing us first.
Please put Chekers aside and begin to listen to what you are told."
In her strong appeal to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers shall remain at their job if they keep their promises”.
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were to betray a decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they must be forced to “encourage”.
“It is now a question of trust between us, people and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you down."
Referring to the excited crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit's betrayal, to feel the urge.
“We are mobilizing this country's people's army, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Brexit opponents took a demonstration at Birmingham, then holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved the Trey v. Brexit posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the conservators because of security problems in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim to be able to build Canada's IT systems and technologies, for work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one full-time farce.
"There is no good Brexit in principle," he claims.
Warren plans to “research” opportunities for participation in the presidential race
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “recognizablely examine the possibilities of running the President's vote”.
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future at a meeting of a town in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican party Jeff Dila, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got a chance to take up Tramp post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holiok, she held a further meeting with the voters; since Trump took office, it has already been her 36th meeting with the voters in the drawing format.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to compete for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for the women to go to Washington to "open" our broken government, and that it was necessary for a woman to be upstairs."
As a result of the killing of Simsa (straight), LSU player was arrested
Baton Row police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect for the murder (fire) of basketball LSU Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
1100 hours in English, at a press conference, the Baton Row police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video recording of the shooting to help identify the person who had been taken to the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot at a South University computer on Friday morning.
“Wayd Sims was shot in the head, resulting in death, ” stated the chief police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade fought for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to participating in the incident, carrying arms and shooting at Wade Sims.
When arrested, Simpson did not resist and was detained at the police department of East Baton Rog.
A young man grew from 1 m to 82 cm in Baton Pink, played 32 games with 10 start-ups in the past season, and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 hits for the game.
Lewis Hamilton nears the title of the world champion after command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fate
It became clear that the Mercedes command tactics would play a major role in the race, since the Valtery Bottas was qualified on Saturday.
Ever since Paul's position, Bottas had a good start, and he's almost hanging out in Hamilton when he's defending his position on the first two corners, and he's invited Fettitel to attack his teammate.
Fetel was the first to go to a pit stop, leaving Humbleton to do his whole group's tail -- a choice that was decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop one circle later, and after leaving behind the Fate, but Hamilton, after some struggle of a wheel wheel wheel, broke forward, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside space free, risking a double movement to defend on a third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferrappin started from the back of the grid and was seventh to the end of the first circle.
He then took most of the race, holding on his native tires, to quickly finish up by pushing Kim Raikkonen to the fourth place.
As a result, he went to a pit stop in his 44th circle, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight circles, since Rykkkonen took his fourth seat.
The day was hard because Waltter had done fantastic work on weekends and had shown real kindness by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a couple of tricks in the reserve," said Hamilton.
A Language of Sign Language
President Donald Trump unveiled Senator Dainne Fainstein in a meeting with the voters on Saturday for claiming that she had not published a letter from Cristina Blace Ford, accused of Britta Kawano, a candidate for the post of Chief Justice, in sexual harassment.
When he spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony of Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that those events were “misleading, disgusting and lying people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is perfect; it is anger, anger, disgustingness and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Do you have any information?
Remember her answer... did you give me the document information? - What?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it.
Okay, stop.
No, we didn't "sing", he added with the senator's entonation.
In July, Fainstein was sent a letter detailing the charges put forward by Ford v. Kawano, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Fistain denies that the flight occurred in her office.
“I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't confiscate her information,” said Financial to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the expulsion charges did not seem to favor the president who commented on this during the Saturday meeting: “That is what I’m going to tell you: the language of the body has given it up.
Maybe she didn't call, but the tongue of the body was the worst that I've ever seen.
While continuing to defend his candidate for the post of Chief Justice, who had been accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that the democracies would use those charges for their own ends.
“They are definitely trying to regain power by all available means.
We see the subservience, the indecentness, and they don't care who they're going to hurt, through whom they're supposed to push for power and control,” quote the President's words.
British elite hockey League: "Dandy Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Jayants"
Patrick Duyer killed two heads, for James in a game against Dundee.
In the game of Elite hockey League, Dundy Stars paid for a Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants by winning a response match on Saturday with a 5-3 account in favour of Dundee.
James was given an early advantage in two heads, thanks to the blows by Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovilla.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Jaints.
François Bushard was equal to Dundee before two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's foreheads secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the victory over Dundee with 2.1 at Belfast on Friday night, this was a third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties during the James season, which won three previous matches.
The first head of Duyer came for a fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., after a hiking pass, Kendalla McFall, supported by David Rutherford, after which Bovillar doubled his advantage four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned his owners to game 13:10 before Matt Markward helped Couna to level up the account at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that James took the initiative at the first break when he hit the second head for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts were regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the bill with a needle at a numerical height of 27:37.
Kooney and Charles Korcran joined together to help Nielsen give Dundee an opportunity for leadership at the end of the second period for the first time, after which he and his team secured victory by holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
James, who has lost four of the last five matches, is now heading to Milton Keins for the next match, to be held on Friday.
The Air traffic inspector died to prevent hundreds of people on board from being hit by an earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic inspector was killed by the hero’s title after he deliberately died in order to enable the aircraft with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawes on Friday, the tsunami.
Strong underground clouds continue to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palu have been hit by buildings.
Although his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Aung refused to leave his post in the most threatening airstrip of Mutiar Sis Al-Jufrey Airport, the city of Pal.
He remained in his position to ascertain that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the landing strip, had been able to take off safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was breaking, he jumped off her.
Later, he died at the hospital.
Indonesia’s Aeronautical Representative Johannes Sirait said that the decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballikpapan in Kalemantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher had died before the helicopter had been able to land in Palm.
“We are very sorry about this loss,” he added.
However, the authorities are concerned that the number of people killed by the earthquake may reach thousands, as access to the cities of Donghal, Sigi and Botong is limited, according to the disaster management agency.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still in the wreckage and many have never been able to get out of it,” says a representative of the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency.
The waves, which were about six feet [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palm, where a mass burial would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Kuzuma, a 35 - year - old mother, explains Sky News: “Encourage is being brought to the victims every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-marks are everywhere looted."
Jan Helfland, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explains CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross’s colleagues are already in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite a serious scale, but it can be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived in Palm on Sunday and addressed the armed forces in particular, saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?' says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was affected by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niguini reports that one person disappeared after a plane crash in the south
The airline, which carried out the flight of victims of the collapse in the Pacific south in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, whereas it was stated earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had left the manned aircraft safely.
Air Niugini says that, as of Saturday afternoon, she has no information about one male passenger.
Aviation stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and aircraft crews after they fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday, six passengers had been hospitalized and all were in a stable state.
The causes of the air crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Airlines and United States Navy claim that the aircraft landed in a southerly area near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the airstrip.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, says that the plane began to enter the airstrip too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had been able to make an emergency visit to the back of the plane because the water level was running along the belt.
He also said that the obsessors panicked and shouted on board, and that he had suffered a slight trauma to his head.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers who repaired nearby also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they carried people to shore before the plane was under water for about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air crashs in the past two decades, but none of these disasters has been related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rolett, has given long-lasting testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used his mobile phone records to create a general picture of the actions of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rooulette reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to the data, that night, Telis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Stanford, but according to his data, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when that happened, the police questioned Sandford.
Sandford's testimony said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sandord if Tellings was telling the truth, saying that he was in the Stanford truck that night, Sandford said, "This is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Telis said he had met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to telephone records, they only convened within one week.
Rolett also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Telis, he removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," says Hayle.
The defence must begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The Big Breed: What's a "conscious hip hop"?
Three hip-oppers are going to fight the negative attitude of this genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group of Bristle claims that the hip hop content has changed from the original political and social problems.
The group wants to go back to its roots and make the "conscious" hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed a resurgence in Britain, thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York nanny sued a couple for racist reasons.
A New York nanny sued a married couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a communication from a woman complaining that the nanny was “other than black”, which the woman mistakenly sent her husband to the nan.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the action has been brought against “the aim of extortion”.
Linsie Placco-Flexman, a mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nanny offered by the Child Care Service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NENEEEEEET, THAT IS NOT ONE THREE FEAR,” wrote Mrs. Placco-Flexman to his husband.
However, instead of sending a text to her husband, she had mistakenly sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
Aware of its integrity, the "strophy" Placco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny who had become an African American did not do her job, and in general, that they were expecting the Filipino, not the African American, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now applies to the couple and seeks compensation for dismissals of $350 a day in six months, under the terms of an initial oral agreement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand: these things are not acceptable,” she said, "Past" on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination”.
Spouses disagree with the racist charge, claiming that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since they would no longer be able to trust her.
“ My wife sent her, in a message, something she did not really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Joe Plasco, a Post.
"But you would trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were loaded, not wanting it yourself?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
Come on, you're welcome."
Referring to the action of extortion, Placco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and had found herself in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you willing to pursue the man in that situation?
"It's not very nice of you," added a banking worker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence in social networks, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand a walk with a speaking bear, as stated in a new letter
Bonda’s daughter, Karen Yankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted by publication, and she wrote: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the person who reads the work for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also told me that her father had worked as an operator on BBC before writing a children's book on bears, and would have refused to publish with optimism, adding that the 60-year-old anniversary of his books had been “and bitter” since they had not become author in the past year.
With regard to the mother of Paddington himself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud of the fact that his character eventually became known.
“ He was a quiet and modest man, ” says his daughter.
"The way Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud, although he did not really think that success was his own credit.
I think he was thinking of Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also gave due respect to the bear himself."
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Following the landing of her daughter, she was taken to the Nice Hospital of Hospital Luis Pasteur 2, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong, ” says Mrs. Ednan Laperus.
“ Then he called again and said that she would die for the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to function, leaving her body.
She died before she was expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who suffered the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“There was no knowing what was going on, ” she says.
“ My head stopped, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I found this all-enlightening feeling of sympathy for the Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have lost loved ones are prevented from suicide at the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are on the Walsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers on which people can apply for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed and when he was 18 years old, he killed himself.
“ I don’t want other parents to experience what I feel every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leedney, says that her son was a great cook and had a hell of a hearty smile.
"Everybody loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, it's like the lights are lit in the room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was really going through terrible times.”
It happened in 2014, and Tyler found his own brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't cease to fear a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards "that people would know there's someone who can go to and tell you everything, even if it's your friend.
We can't sit still and keep quiet, we must talk to people."
Mrs. Humphries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who had been with him for 15 years, not shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or something of this sort, ” she says.
“ In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his attitude.
He was particularly ill at Christmas; he did not even look at children when they opened their gifts."
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through this, and this event has shocked our family.
It cut her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging on his hair: the FBI is starting an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation that was limited in time and volume — we could bring a little bit of unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was “done out” against the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's time for them to hesitate.
The interim elections will be held in just five weeks, on 6 November, and, if, as it is expected, everything will go wrong for the Republicans, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him for the office of supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavano, who had been working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 democracies.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano would be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his nomination for the post of Chief Justice.
North Korean winners dropped at Kim
Since Kim Cheng Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has been reduced by a South Korean legislator.
Pak Bin Sung, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared to 2,766 escape incidents recorded in 2011, that figure had dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the border controls between North Korea and China had become a key factor, as well as the higher rates of smuggling by people.
The nuns give no public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean exiles are eventually offered citizenship to South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people run through China, the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the securely protected demilitarized zone (LMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as irregular migrants rather than refugees and often subject them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jin in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ry Young Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on this issue by their sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavano “ilistic” and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “unilateral” and said that he was not acceptable to the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Plossey made this comment in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival, Austin, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman were to let herself be treated in this way, she would immediately be called a dyslexic,” says Pelosi, about her reaction to Kavanano’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Bleis Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment allegedly occurring when both were still teenagers.
Kavano was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and breathing, talking about his family and school years.
He also clearly condemned the Committee's democracies, calling him “a grotesque and clearly planned murder of the acting person”, organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election of 2016.
Plosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavano ' s statements merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a biased attitude towards democracies.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he attacks Clinton and the democracies,” she says.
Plossey was upset when asked if she would try to hold Kavano accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if the democracies received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say, if he does not speak the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he is not only lawful for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is present at the moment,” said Pélosi.
Kavano is currently a judge of the D.C District Appeal Court.
Plosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano with regard to the Access to Health Services Act or the “Row v. Wade” because he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing, Kawano’s candidature turned down the question of whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not now time to let the hysterious and biased man go to the office of the high judge, but to cry out, ‘ How excellent! ’ ” Pélos said.
And women have to own it.
It's pure anger, months and years of rage, and she can't go through it without tears.
“When we get mad, we cry, ” Ms. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was working somewhere in a senior position who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her roommate, ‘ You can think I’m crying because I’m upset.
I'm really mad."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed as an exit for anger in part because they are misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office, where men dominated me, was one time I cried with intense anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a heartless manager, who was always terribly scared and threw out on a ladder cell.
“Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
'They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think that you are disappointed, and rejoice in the fact that they have brought you forth."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on some minor incident and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to stop her from running for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me 30 years later.
“At that time seven other candidates participated, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Belonsk and Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was already coming to an end, and she was very far behind in her fund-raising, so she swore she wouldn't be in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It seemed like a totally lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave 1,000 dollars to men, offered her only 250.
“What is for them, a good commodity, what? ” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion that she thanked the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access voters, as well as anger over gender-based discrimination that she was choked.
“You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, ” she recalls,“the way the press responded to it.
“ I could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my monument?
"She's been crying all the way?"
How the trade war with America can be useful to Beijing
The experts believe that the first scenes of the U.S.-China trade war have been ignored, and while the battle is far from over, the divide between countries can be of long-term benefit to Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The greatest escalation took place this week, with new tariffs affecting 200 billion dollars' worth of goods (150 billion pounds) in fact taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing, each time, struck equally, has recently imposed an amount of $60 billion to 10 per cent on American goods.
China has promised that the U.S. response will be equal every time, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to begin to experience at least the smallest challenges in the near future.
To force Washington to resign would mean entering the claims, but to get the US publicly would be too shameful for Ci Jingpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its maps properly, the U.S. trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic power station in either of these countries is actually far more dangerous than the observers had previously admitted,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Analytical Centre of New American Security (Centre for the New American Security) specialized in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria had prepared for the return of refugees
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance for the reconstruction of the country that has been devastated by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valed Al-Mu ' aal said that conditions were improving in the country.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure as a result of progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore terrorist-damaged areas so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, which they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country needed humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for its assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any circumstances or assistance from countries that sponsored terrorism.
Europe forms a victory in Rider's Cube in Paris
The European team won Rider's Cup 2018 by winning the U.S. team from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times on European land, and the European Rider Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown with the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who had gained 14.5 points he needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikelson, who fought a lot of the tournament, took his first long shot into the water on the 16th hole of the couple-3 and entered his match of Francesco Molinary.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1st to 4th players who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American, Jordan St., suffered defeat at 5:4 a player with the lowest rating on the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Justin Johnson, was assigned to 2:1 Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in Ryder's Cuba last time.
The Spanishman Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has been a winner of European history with 25.5 points for a career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It was a complicated year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get another cup.
It's all on the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says emotional Garcia after European victory.
He's sending a torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won a victory on Sunday over American legends, Ralph Tiger Woods, with a 2-1 score in a single game.
“I am very proud of this victory,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France, and his career record now stands at 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange to one of the greatest players of all the time, who won 14 principal titles, only replaced Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. has fought all the weekend in vain, trying to succeed, an exception being Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have shown the hog of the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürick said after a discouraging presentation from his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to shake Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
Take off our hats before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players were great.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Kutka Ryder Committee, and we'll move forward in a successful way.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We should be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news of the concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinlas, Manati and Sarasta
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wild Nature Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay region.
According to FWC, there is a high level of colour in the regions of Pinlas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in micro-organism.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles [130 km] of shore from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
Some 10 miles from Hillsborough, but compared to the previous week, the number has declined significantly.
The red tide is also seen in the Pasco district.
Last week, it was reported that there was an average concentration in and around Pinlas district, from low to high coastal concentrations in the Hillsboro district, high concentrations in the districts of Manati and Sarasta and coastal areas, average concentration in Charlotte District, high concentration on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in the Coler district.
In Pinlas, Manati, Sarasta, Lee and Collier districts, there is still the risk of annoyance of respiratory paths.
No such probability was reported in Northwest Florida last week.
