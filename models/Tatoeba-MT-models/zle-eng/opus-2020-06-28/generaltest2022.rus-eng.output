From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by Balsakovian ladies on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danilsky and Volkonski.
Of course, in terms of the same balsakovian age.
And the psychology and torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev heroin is not so interesting for adolescents.

Mattas Promex Micropackage Prestege 105x195.
"Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The matrase has a different rigidity of the sides: the medium-City surface is made up of latex coconut fibre and natural latex, moderately soft -- a plate of natural latex.
A forward block of 1,000 spring per square metre is quickly adapted to the sleeping body, preventing the effects of the “volals” or “gasmac”.
The model needs to include breathing materials among its merits.
Latex perforated for airtight is well ventilated naturally, like the coconut cosmos.
This maintains a healthy microclimate of the bedroom.
The matras also extend the extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the producer is 5 years old, and the matrasa life is greater.
Protection against dust and pollution is assigned to a detachable chajkol from the jackard in the package.

Germany: The fourth vaccination against the coronary disease is inevitable
A fourth vaccination would be necessary in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final but would continue with a new force.
Despite an active training campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of measles vaccine are likely to be insufficient for full protection.
The leader of the Association of General Doctors, Ulrich Wygeldt, is convinced.
Saturday, 11 December, reports Die Welt.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, at least in the autumn”, the expert considers.
In addition, Wygldt hopes that the fourth vaccine will be vaccinated by a measles virus.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccinations can help combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron Cretan.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of reabsorption of Omicone is three times higher than that of a Delta or Beta strain.
This is evident from a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new version of Omicron.
BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses, the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower: “a neutral capacity is reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that the two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against the omecron-tamma infection”, emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
That's why we need a third dose.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zatzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to the Saltzberger, accelerated vaccinations will influence the spread of both the delta-virus and the micron-warriant coroner.
" Israel's questioning is very convincing," stressed the expert.
Webbler Panton21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silver, 54 mm, 8.5
The Bay-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Panton21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other samples that were originally created with regard to the use for underwater fishing, not just for injections.
These bristles are larger than those of those close to the equivalents, which certainly have a positive impact on the nuances of applying these interesting baites.
Another recognized feature is the upper flipper of a strong and spousal plastic, which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal wires.
As a "smart whizz", a pretty aggressive game is shown in the Bet-A-Vib mark.
Often the most catch is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movements of the blower up and down almost without a pause.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis is not too large, it is convenient to catch in a limited area covered by underwater vegetation, roots and other obstacles for which a string is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant to the catch of a winter ship and a large perch, especially in the middle of winter, when a precise and aggressive bait is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the path, Bet-A-Vib is immediately turned around and returned to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for wintertimes to catch platter trout.
To please it, it can be chosen from or without two modifications: a tumultule (NS - NanoSund).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to blow a passive rat that does not even respond to a human.
Bet-A-Vib capture shows range and accuracy.
It's understood and not caprizen, well combined with even larger diameters of a lion and a gossipy cord.
To catch a rat, a pebbles, a pebbles, or an eye, except for the equally relevant, and a step, sometimes with a hole on the bottom.
If you're caught in the blackouts, you can change the fork to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of a hit.
Among the attractions of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most sustainable in the work and, consequently, one of the most vulnerable.
Both relatively small and relatively deep sites can be used with the same success.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36.

In Libya, hundreds of Russian mercenaries were declared
In Libya there are over 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company Wagner.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 PAC mercenaries in Libya, “Wagner”.
They also have aircraft.
They also play trenches in Sirte and Cufree.
They have 30 jet planes on Gardabiya airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” is the result of his words by Akinlu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries “are trying to capture” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “puting its human person in power” in the Central African Republic.
Save presence
According to the co-chair of the publication, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “restricted in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbasing and the port in Sirte, as well as the Juba airbasing, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities formally deny that the CVC Vagner is supported by the Kremlin.
Where there may be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner is suspected to operate in nine countries in Africa - the Central African Republic, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection to leaders and protection of energy installations.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiary enterprises are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of mineral and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the “warers” were allegedly at war in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not defined in the power agencies or in the Gaulitz register, and its combatants are not included in the uniformed personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that the 27 EU countries had previously approved the "Vagner" raids.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of Europe on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament, with consultative functions with dominant Islamists, writes the TSS.
This body has repeatedly called for the relocation of a single day of voting on the election of parliamentarians and heads of State since 24 December at least for February 2022.
"The election remains for less than two weeks, and the chances that they will pass within a period of time decline rapidly," is noted in the material.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed the announcement of a final list of candidates indefinitely, transmitting the Sky News Arabia television channel.
Outlying politics by Russians ’ Eyes
38% of Russians see the country ' s foreign policy as more successful than failure, 29% believe that failure prevails.
“The signs of success - in Syria, ‘defense, restore the world there,'” “North Stream-2,” “the whole world was afraid that heavy weapons,” “Crime we've given up”.
The main failures are “conflation with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “insclusion from the world”, as stated in the Fund's study entitled “University”.
Dubai's Government has completely abandoned paper business -- all the government officials have also become digital.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete waiver of paper business and digital transfer.
All public services will also be provided electronically.
This is reported by WAM Emirate News Agency.
"The day of the day marked the beginning of a new digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life -- we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," stated Prince Emirata, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Mactoum.
At present, the internal and external processing of all institutions in Dubai will be done in numerical form only through ad hoc information platforms.
The innovation affected everything in the industry without exception: health, CCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to electronic government and the digitalization of the document began in Dubai since 2018.
Since then, the authorities have estimated savings of 336 million paper sheets, representing 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalents.
Previously, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobin, said that electronic services would save citizens two days a year.

Turkey ' s manufacturing and export of vehicles dropped below 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars declined sharply in November, against the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, industrial performance after 11 months was worse than last year ' s results, according to Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Association of Road Manufacturers.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were fired in Turkey in November, an increase of 20 per cent over the previous year.
Some 75.9 thousand vehicles have been exported, more than 25 per cent falling short of last year ' s show.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey ' s road sector has demonstrated a positive momentum by the past year, it has already produced 0.3 per cent worse since the end of the 11 months of 2021.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29 per cent cheaper than the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 ISB entities received a loan delay in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smail, reported on the situation of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, transmitting to the MIA correspondent, Kansinform.
“On the information of the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the request of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 on the approval of a delay in the granting of payments for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises,” wrote Alihan Smylov in his reply to the representative’s request.
He recalled that the granting of deferred loan payments included the granting by banks and microfinance organizations of a delay in the payment of credit payments issued before 1 April 2021 to IB entities, including PPI, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The delay was from 30 days to 90 days by choice of an ISB entity.
The borrower ' s application could have specified a different period of deferred payments.
During the delay on the borrower's behalf, claims-for-payments were suspended, notice of the need to settle the arrears, as well as the borrowing by the creditor of commissions and other payments,” noted the freezer.
In 2021, second-level banks were requested to defer payments for 603 ISB borrowers, of which 553 MB entities received 9.7 billion tenge deferred.
IFIs have applied for a postponement of 131 ISB entities, of which 95 entities with a value of 105.8 million tenge have been granted a delay,” concluded A. Smail.
Pulmonologist Purresev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily bear the strain of the “comiron”
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could experience it more easily than those with strong protective reactions
Pulmonologist Sergey Purresev explained why the strain of a cochmron king might be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the context of the virus’s birth.
Scientists believe that the “comiron” is born in the body of a infected HIV or suffering immunodeficiency virus.
I mean, he didn't meet any resistance to immunity when he was tormented.
That's why he's more aggressive.
Because there was no response to immunity, he became very quick.
Apparently, there's these whites, the thorns, maybe more than it's supposed to be, their antibodies weren't cut during the mutation, and they're commenting on the pulmonologist Sergey Puresev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity could be able to carry “comiron” more easily than those who had a strong protective reaction.
Turns out, the body's strong response to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococs infection, when young people die 30 years of age, and old people, who are 60 years old in the form of cheja.
The immune response of the young man is totally inadequate: where he can only be threatened with a finger, he hits like a gun on a soldier, and he concluded Sergey Puresev.
The doctor also recalled that there are dangerous side effects and that the worst of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and rapidly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only symptoms -- all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is the beginning of the body's intoxication -- temperature, weakness, weakness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, snorkeling, coughing.
The pain on the right or on the left, abominal pain, can also be a sign of a growing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation of 12 to 18 years may be vaccinated before the end of the year.
A virus specialist, MFTI’s director of genetic engineering, Pavel Volchkov, pointed out that this category is heavily affected by coconuts.
Young people who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most active social progeny, like the day-care providers, of "Moscow 24" by Paul Volckov, a virologist, the head of the IFTC genetic engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis on why people with obesity fall victim to the coconut.
The authors studied the fat tissue left behind from baritarian operations and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with a carnirus.
Immune cells in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected and strong inflammatory reactions were shown.
Scientists have also studied the fat tissue of cocaine patients and have discovered carvirus particles in fat that are surrounded by various organs.
HIV and flu virus are known to be hiding in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the response of the immune system.
It's probably the same SARS-ComV-2.
Biologist reported on the causes of dementia
A biological candidate, Simeon Goloshakin, described the reasons for the dementia and how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
Sindress is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and over time, people find it difficult to guide themselves even in a familiar environment.
The Holocaust noted that dementia is most often caused by neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metamorphosis and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, social exclusion and the absence of active cognitive activities could be factors,” he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and low - income lifestyles.
Among the early signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
“The discussion is that hearing loss can be both an early case of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor”, added biology.
In order to prevent the occurrence of disease, WHO recommends that the necessary level of physique be maintained, that the cognitive skills and abilities needed to be involved in memory and logic be trained.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegally removed artefacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo Government has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts to their homeland, which have been smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by the Chief Inspector, Al-Hayat, Department of Returned Ancients, Ministry of Tourism and Ancient Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C., discovered 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gauad stated that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in archives.
The Department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists are “tracking auctions around the world and selling on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums upon return.
He said that one of the returning artifacts was found in Belgium by an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of an exhibition by the National Museum of Egyptian Civilizations in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to assist in finding an auction sold at Pharaoh Tutanghamon in London.
Christie's auction house held tenders on 4 July, where a man over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5,97 million (about 680 million roubles).
Egypt’s frustration was a source of great disillusionment.
The Egyptian side also claims that art was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tuthanhamon, depicted in the image of the god of the sun of Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been traded since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is not known.
In recent years, Egypt has actively sought to repatriate illegally removed monuments of ancient times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling of ancients is the result of archaeological prospecting of “sun-scrapers”.
“Do not take account of Crimean Tartars” is correct, as Crimean Tartars (232,000) are an independent people (nearly to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only a Turkish language group joins them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants personal mobile devices available to staff
Credit Susse requires his staff to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not provide corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or a smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
The current rules allow the bank to view information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to test mobile devices in extremes - for example, when a staff member used it to meet a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote operating conditions, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to deal with business issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline for the staff to consult the new rule.
Formally, Credit Suse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of his life, Sergey Esenin -- 1925 -- has been very productive in terms of creativity, but the worst for his poet and his "hego."
He's already out of the reach of any literary association, and he's been spread to Islam, he's on his own, but he's known, he's taken out, and he's a hard-witting critic at times, even vicious, but he's reading the public is ready to carry him in his arms.
Over 60 poems were written over a year, many of them were paintings, completed by the Persian Motivator cycle, by Ana Snygin's poems, published by 8 books, and the Russ of Soviet.
And the main success is at the end of June 25th year, Hossadt made an agreement with Esenin to publish his works in volume 3.
None of today's Sergea Alexanderic poets have been so honored, he's the first.
In addition, this brought very good money, and under the contract, the fees were 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 roubles per month, engineer 200).
The money was needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married Liva Tolstoy Tolstoy Tolstoy, had to educate his family father, support Katia and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It's as if life would be built, as if to enjoy it, but it's all painted mostly in dark tones, as if it had materialized the nightmare of "The Dark Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind whistled?
Above the empty and desolate field,
It's like growing in September,
Alcohol is sleeping in the brain.
Many acquaintances have noted that Esenin has given up badly, does not look very ill.
It's more and more common to take a break, you're going to have nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
In fact, if such diagnosis -- alcoholism -- Sergey Alexanderovic was treated with someone, there were no reliable documents left.
Say, dated May 1923, when Esenin, at his fourth wife’s urging, the Americans of Aysedor Duncan treated health at Paris’s clinic at Professor Peter Hannuskin (the mother of Esenin will fall two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's posture, these soil scandals, the militia's wires are enough -- they're full of tens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, a terrible poet with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a buddy, an Igsinist, Ivan Starz.
It's amazing, but Esenin never had his home in Moscow or Peter, found him in rented apartments, hotels or acquaintances.
The elders remember:
"I only had to stay overnight, and in most cases I was in a state of insanity.
One day, returning at 4:00 a.m., Esin fell on the stairs...
I've lost my face and I've lost my face.
When he came a bit, he began coughing all over the simple blood...
Esin himself, after fighting for Europe and the U.S. (the United States had a dry law at the time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the cabs and the streets...
At the end of the day, I stopped remembering people...
Well, I'm drinking, of course...
And I was drinking because the toast was full."

Matras Promtex-Oritant Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economics - Modern implementation of the budget model in the line-of-the-line premium.
The base is a block of independent double spring Dut.
A weaker small spring is inserted inside a large spring.
This allows for the even distribution of the load on the mattress.
On the two sides of the matras are filled with an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and spousity of this material enhances the comfortable effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hemollergenic, it doesn't drink moisture and dust.
Matras is a fine couple with a big difference in weight (up to 30 kilograms).
With smart spring, there's no wave effect here, when a light partner runs on the side of a heavy one.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “weapons”
Paul Jablonsky, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, expressed the view that President Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as “weapons” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operations” next year.
A related statement was made by the U.S. chiefs of the MID in an interview with Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “restricted Lukashenko”, but he “are actively seeking new ways”.
A Polish official also believes that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As kp.ru stated, the European Union had previously imposed the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He referred to 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there has been a willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a broad list of products from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

As early as September, he appeared in a barhat raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bondow" girl at the front film "No Time to Die."
Following his example, he was followed twice by Prince William, who first gave the Episcopal ceremony The Earthsht Preize to the royal wood code of green barkhate jacket, and then selected a more classic version to support the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel of the Messiah took the trend.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolsa & Gabbana's barhat.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barachite male jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the services reported in Gasetu.Ru, they were purchased up to 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm baked jackets with pussy and silhouettes, the main colors are black, bearded, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6,000 roubles, and men prefer to buy only pajamas - the set of barhat suits they choose less.
It's not just online fares that can buy them.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In this season, nearly all brands - and Bruni - and Paul Smith, and Entro, and Saint Lauent are represented in the blux pajamas segment.
The most desirable model is Gucci, which launched one of the "Dum Gucci" film of the Ambasador brand Jared Leto.
You can be sure that the barhat is made of silk when you choose the jackets of expensive stamps.
Thanks to the special web interlacing technology, a thick cloth is produced from the voracious outer texture and smooth interior.
More budget options are made from cotton or polymide, but are also less likely to be used accordingly.
A mobile expert, Lomuda Ilya Wakhoskin, warns that, in the case of a barhat jacket, the main thing is not his model or fasson, but its relevance.
"Barhat demands nightlight, so it's ideal if you're going to a party or a commemorative event," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion for which it is permitted to make choices in favour of barhat jacket is the buyer ' s status.
"The language in the barhatting jacket, first of all, must be derived from the right advanced balsam with plenty," they consider the authors of the Telegram-canada on the male fashion of "Kraska Bramwell." --The barhatting players tend to belong to the castes of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to sit-in lighting events, where wood-code is always specified.
Ilya Wahoshkin suggests combining a jacket from a barkhate with the same good stuff: classical trousers with one-to-one shirts, silk ties, ankles and stickers.
Too simple and day-to-day things will look inappropriate.
Mobile experts from Brammel's Grassack are confident that it will also be inappropriate to appear in the barhats of a private employee on a corporation, and that's when it's about “a guide from among those who handle the event, then - yes, to him that's the thing about the topic”.
If the employee is lower and his goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick off the financial bonus, it is best not to wear a barhat jacket.
Management will certainly appreciate this by saying, "Not on the Snow's cap," they think, "Telegram-canala's editors are talking about male fashion.
A very mixed sense of voice.
It's not natural, it's so worn out.
And nothing is associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But I desire good deeds from my heart.
It's all about money -- alternative energy is being released well, so it's paying off.
Milliard investments.
Do they grieve?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy was also not used in oil and gas, and coal was bought cheaper than it was now being sold.
The fuel's out of demand.
The bastard's dropping.
Then who's in the flight?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered as being idiots in the energy crisis.
They've done their job.
For a good match.
I didn't see any beautiful person on the picture in the article.
It's just the middle-class average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are confident of their beauty so much that they decide to show it on the whole car, they will not be able to do so, most likely.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "reds", but it's not exactly because of their appearance.
Kazbek, “a slave conscious of and fighting against his slave status is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery, and who makes a silent, unknowing and unholy slave life, is simply a slave.
A slave whose sledges flow, when he alone describes the beauty of the life of a slave, and rejoices with a good master, there is a cold, a ham.
The immunologist stated that the revacuation in four to five months would help protect itself from the strain of a coroner.
Re-vacuation in four to five months can protect against the new strain of the cancer cancer.
Such a statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very large period."
“In the past, it was normal, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four,” said the expert, calling for a revacuation in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revacation provides a good titanium for neutral antitels.
“If a man made two vaccinations and sandwiches, or he was sick and vaccinated, or was vaccinated, he got “hybrid immunity”, that is, the antitel is rich and neutral enough,” the expert explained.
The Greater Semerka warned Russia of “greater consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G-7 countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, France, Japan and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of heads of IED in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be costly” in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the build-up of the Russian military power and of the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine.”
The Ministers further urge Russia “to ease the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency in military activities”, as President Baiden spoke during the video presentation to President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Norman format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, also stated the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-7.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response,” they caution.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine ' s restraint.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” also stated in the statement.
The head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated earlier that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed the “one voice of the G-7 countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have tremendous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was considered to be 32 times less efficient than omicromma
The effectiveness of the vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech vs. micro-tamnirus is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
This conclusion has been reached by scientists from Hong Kong University and China University of Hong Kong, and is transmitted to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccin was considered less effective by a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of COVID-19 drug.
“We see that most people had a high level of anti-virus activity against Sars-CoV-2, but that capacity had been significantly reduced against micro-diversity”, Professor Malik Peyris told us.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most secure way to protect against the severe current of the disease when infected with measles.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the Caravirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on omicron Stamma.
The authors of the study concluded that the micro-tamma could trigger a new wave of virus circulation and mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The Head of Mines accused the FWG of blocking the supply of arms to NATO in Kiev
Alexei Reznikov, Head of Defence of Ukraine, accused the Government of former Chancellor FWG Angel Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had placed a veto on the purchase of Ukrainian anti-Osperian systems and rifles for the wounding of the pollinators.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Lithuania.
FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier in Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrey Melnick, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholce.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbase, despite the “occupation of Russia” of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, certain diplomat, Germany will remain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Greenski stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in the ship ' s equipment.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to “be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense” to add the President.
It was also noted that, in the spring of this year, FRG co-chair of the Green Party, Robert Habek, visited a republic in which he spoke for the sale of the Kivus of defence weapons.

“The Russian Federation should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, states a declaration issued on the website of the British Government.
The Ministers of the G7 and the EU Supreme Representative noted that “one thing in his condemnation of Russian armed reinforcements and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.

We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine,” she said (TSS citate).
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, the Foreign Ministers G7 agreed that, in order to resolve the crisis, Russian troops on the border with Ukraine must return to the negotiating table.
It was about the “Normand format” negotiations.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normande format”.
The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zaharova, stated that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries had “described themselves to being unable to accept responsibility for their own errors”.

Discovered ways of returning stolen online money
There are several ways to get back money stolen through the Internet and not be a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in interviews with the RBC.
In order to reduce the risk of major losses, for example, bank cards are recommended in the hands of offenders to store essential funds in a map or bank account that are not used in online encryption.
Some savings can be deferred to a savings account and released as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen from shops that did not use defense technology 3D Secure, the recovery procedure could be launched.
“In the framework of the rules established by the payment systems on unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Safety, the responsibility lies with the participant in the chain of calculations that do not use the service,” the representative of Promslink.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecommoy Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require two-factory authorization, the transaction could be contested and returned.
In some cases, it is noted, Internet companies themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the Safety Internet League, Catherine Myzulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received: from selling counterfeit documents to stealing personal data.
She said that an effective solution in the current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints about online frauds.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss “North Flow-2” and EU legislation
The newly elected chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops across Ukraine and the situation of the Russian pipeline, “North flow-2”.
Although Shotz has expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed clear expectations of each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravecki, stated that he would call on Scholz to speak against the “North Flow-2” on which Russian gas is expected to be transferred to Germany on the road to Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia could use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to halt the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the legal reforms of the “Rights and Justice” party violated EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay a fine and its highest court held that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new Government of Germany, which was sworn in on Wednesday despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of “North Flow-2” in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials stated to Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany of stopping gas pipelines, if Russia invaded Ukraine, reported a high-level official to the United States Congress on Tuesday.
German officials failed to confirm these reports, but Scholz warned of the consequences if Russia violated the Ukrainian border on Sunday, confirming the representatives of the G-7.

The money that's found in the church wall is going to pay $20,000.
The Security Officer who found money in the church wall in Texas, U.S. state, will pay the reward.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoopers of Houston.
The incident took place in the great evangelical church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin is preaching, promising that God - fearing Christians would expect wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, the plumber, Justin Coulley, repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and cheques equipped with thermal insulation.
He passed on to the church and, he said, he was not even grateful from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could do," quote KPRC-TV.
The finding seems to be related to the theft that took place in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, some $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cash were lost in the form of checks kept in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no loss.
Nevertheless, information about the criminals was paid $25,000 for.
Justin Coulley could not claim that amount, since the award had expired.
Despite this, a non-profit organization, Crym Stoopers of Houston, in time providing $5,000 and later receiving another $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
It was reported earlier that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Leikwood church wall.

Citizens who have anti-integration certificates have been released from the issuance of vaccination certificates.
Persons who have come from countries where no vaccine has been proven are also listed.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for the holding of new-day, pre-carnative and quarantine parties, as well as other events, which involve an increase in the tourist trade”, Barroso noted.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities had committed the unacquainted five - day quarantines to the coronal infection of tourists.
Open scheme for full protection against COVID-19
A virus specialist, doctor of medical science, well-deserved Russian science Anatoly Altstein, interviewed Ura.ru in a series of complete protections against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved through the introduction of injections and the use of nascent vaccines.
International use has resulted in a large number of immunoglobulin A. In the introduction of vaccines, it does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the slippery shell, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside of the vaccine, we have the biggest immunoglobulins, G (anti-tele) being immunoglobulins.
And if you enter both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but now there's no solution for double vaccination," he told me.
Chief prophylacticist UrFO, doctor of medical science Sergey Tokaev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nascent vaccinations together with injection is the ability to stop being a COVID-19 medium.
He added that this would help in that case the protection of the body was supposed to be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health, David Melik-Gussenov, said that by the new surge in the COVID 19 pandemic, a new coronary infection among children would be spreading.
He said that this is the case in other countries, where the regular wave of the pandemic came earlier.

Many of my hosts were in a hurry to avoid running after the dog, even though they were due to run away, 200,000, straight by the hand, and take the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the host instead of the dog that ran out there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccinations continue
More than 40,000 demonstrators came to the streets in the Austrian capital city of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the cocaine vaccine mandatory.
Since February of next year, the unacquainted will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
The Spanish, who were outraged by the health authorities, had held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some people were holding posters with the inscription "This Is a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital city of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, coconut certification is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by authorities in a number of regions has led to an increase in the number of cocaine infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand Manifestines protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The attack began peacefully but then turned into clashes with the guards of the order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied water.

WHO has discovered a “mikron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new strain of the Crow “Omikron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The pace of strain spread was reported by WHO.
According to the organization, on 9 December, strains have been detected in 63 countries, all six WHO regions.
This is because it has been active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned at the high rate of expansion of the new version of the Coravirus.
WHO experts express the fear that new strains on preliminary data may be affected by the spread of Delta strains, but it is a Indian version of the Caravirus, which is currently in operation in all absolute countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Teddy Adhan Gebreis, stated that the omicro-tams could have a significant impact on the coronary pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also come to Great Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "mikron" in the coming months will crowd out the delta.
And the number of sick people in Britain alone is about 1 million, with an official meicronian currently suffering several hundred people in the Kingdom, estimated to be up to 10,000.
The British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the “mikron” strain, and in peaks, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
The British health system will not be able to cope.
The situation is compounded by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the memikron strain is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the micron is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gammala Centre has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the micron strain.

Israeli Prime Minister Bennett reported on the introduction of vaccinations in schools
Since Sunday, Israel ' s Ministry of Health has launched an emergency programme to increase immunization.
Since the morning of 12 December, there has been vaccinations for Caravirus in schools throughout Israel.

Both the number of downloads of applications and the cost of users showed significant increases between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8 per cent, reaching 140 billion still existing costs in applications: 25% to record $135 billion.
Such data was published by Apple Annie, an analytical company that reported on the mobile market in 2021.

The Russian Federation warned of a new scheme of frauds
The criminals began to look for new maneuvers for video fraud.
“Investment” is written with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products, Ivideon Zaura Aboutalimova, the primary danger associated with the distribution of video communications is dipfy.
In this case, fraudulent video videos are produced on the basis of actual records involving the victim.
As a result, neuroscientists are able to reproduce accurately the characteristics of a person’s conduct.
At Aboutalimov added that by using a dipfy, the perpetrators could call a familiar victim via video link or create a video show involving a copy of a man to send for blackmail purposes.
“These counterfeitings can easily lead to bulling, as a pegged man can put people in blind, dangerous or compromising pseudoscreasances,” said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetlock, in turn, pointed out that psychological people trust more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of technology using video.
David, I'll add.

Five actions to help avoid diabetes are listed
Blood sugar problems are among the most common problems in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to it, nor do they.
Heat diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive interventions play a central role in preventing disease.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime, reducing the quantity of drinks and improving the use of conventional water for it.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when used in excess.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying and keeping things at home.
Not only is eating wrong but habits also affect the occurrence of the disease.
Much movement is needed to reduce the risks of diabetes.
Experts recommend that low carbon dioxide be maintained.
Such a diet will not only help lower weight but will also protect from sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
Many cells need to be eaten to protect them from diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the sense of sittists, the provision of food juices, and the improvement of eating.

Dr. Paula told me about the "mire of the weekend" in the labour force.
Several factors may lead to a deterioration of weekend feelings
The reason for the deterioration of self-esteem after workdays is often a “morning of the weekend”, reported a well-known doctor, a medical candidate, a senior science researcher at the Department of Basic Medicine of the MoU, a scientist at the U.S. General Medicine Department of Zuhr Paul in his telegram-kanal.
She said that it is particularly common for workmen who suffer from headaches, breakdown, and weakness during the weekend.
The doctor of Paul noted that, in addition to a week’s fatigue, there are quite many objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
In the weekend, our lives are changing dramatically.
"We've spent a long day lying on the couch, most likely eating more, and drinking less, has been argued by the doctor.
And because of overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken."
A later recovery is further important.
Thus, if you stand three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called the Jetlag.
It arises from travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which factor plays a crucial role in the deterioration of feelings of self - importance, Paul recommended that the most important changes be observed during the weekend.

South Africa scientists have stated that the Pfizer vaccine against “mykron” is not effective.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine has been declared ineffective against the memikron vaccine.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa carried out a study and reported that the Pfizer vaccine against oxycron-tams of coronary infection was not effective.
It is estimated that he (the level of physique) is equivalent to (the level) of the vaccine's effectiveness of 22.5% against symptom infection, which... causes the vaccine's ability to protect against infection to be questioned, is stated in a study published on the MadRxiv portal.
However, experts have specified that the drug can be saved from the severe effects of the disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that micro-stams of Cavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics with more frequent hospitalization than a year ago in the United Kingdom.
How many hidden sugars do you have in your ordinary foods?
The sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its surplus in diet can lead to second-type diabetes and can also cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that under an unknown word, a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to calorie sugar, composition and glyme index may be specified.
Several dozens of names may be presented on the label, essentially indicating sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fruit.
There may also be other raw sugar, such as dextroza (a corn sugar), leulosa (froact sugar), melassa (a black stream), argili syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and dysaharids, and they can be not only in air products, but also in ketchups, in doctor's bulbs, bread, etc.
According to Russia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and raw products, as well as labels and numerous different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are of taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the produce is syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only is sugar shown by the manufacturer on the package but it is also necessary to consider that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than indicated in the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas loses its importance for the FWP in 25 years.
New chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports were of no importance to Germany, as the country continued to move towards de-carbation of the economy.
He said that by 2045 Germany planned to completely phase out gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
"It is 25 years later that the world will have a different role to play in transporting gas to the FRG and Europe," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is important for energy transition at the moment.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement containing the support of Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
Previously, German head Annalene Burbok stated that the process of certification of the gas pipeline "North Stream - 2 was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should be applied to European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline did not yet meet the requirements of the European Union.

The hackers hacked a Twitter account from the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The criminals were able to publish a flash report.

By referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same outcome as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, most New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the two previous ballots.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France was expressed by 3.51 per cent (2,755) of those who voted, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against”.
It was 43.90 per cent, with over 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
According to France-Presse, France-Pressé, “the departure of these elections left no room for doubt”, as independence supporters called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed the referendum on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID 19 epidemic on the archipelagine was preventing the conduct of a full-fledged and “pure” electoral campaign.
Thus, this non-cooperation opened the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, from 2020 to 53.3 per cent.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last ballot and will challenge them to the UN.
On Sunday, 12 December, at the Palace of Elise, French President Emmanuel McCron was told to speak on the basis of the referendum.
The topic of the independence of New Caledonia has been a source of much renewal of the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for the President expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it was “the last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," repeated Eric Earth on several occasions.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valery Peckrez, who published a column at Le Figaro in late October, calling on the Kaledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel McCron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it was not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire for the Meledan choice to be the choice of France”.

The world's first laser-weapon gun gun gun was tested in Turkey
In Turkey, the world ' s first laser-armed wire has been successfully tested.
The "Eren" BPLA protested from 100 to 500 m away, reports MIR24.
The machine is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance with a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3,000 metres.
Following the relevant tests, the BPLA should proceed with the arming of Turkish military personnel who would use it to destroy explosive devices without using sperm.
The Agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own droids.

WSJ readers have criticized the article on Russia’s and USA’s relations
The Wall Street Journal screened an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision of Russian and U.S. relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly offered Ukraine as a sacrifice of Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and allowed a number of insulting remarks to be addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the day, Hartwell called on Western countries to “go forth with one front against Russia”.
WSJ readers disagreed with the American professor's position.
"This article has quite a lot of false information," brings up RIA News with a reader's comment.
“Europe is not ours to wipe it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," said another.

Magnetic earthquake 5.2 took place in the Kurilla Islands area
A magnetoid earthquake of 5.2 occurred near Shikotan, the Kuryl Island.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 kilometres north-east of North-Curilsk.
The impact was 92.5 km deep.
Previously, seismologists reported an earthquake of 7.5 magnetoids in Peru, affecting ten people.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of jet-plastics
In the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, jet-free aircraft like ANKA will be set up.
On 11 December, an officer from the office of President Alexei Arestovic of Ukraine reported this.
So they're able to act against the airstrips, against the other colorless.
Even against aircraft manned.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish Aviones, and so on, quote its Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA machinery, Arestovic stated that it was the reactive rather than the spin-off BPLs.
He said that this is a new generation of colorless people after Bayraktar who are more than his “in all his characteristics”.
The first BPLA party was to be produced by the plant at the end of the next year, concluded by Arestovich.
ANKA was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a pilot was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Headquarters, information was provided on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rocket complexes during military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern war-frees had begun.
According to him, Ukraine intended to use droids.
On 29 September, Bairaktar Savunma and Ukrainian mortars entered into an agreement to build a centre in the Kiev region to train staff and test and maintain Turkish BPLA Bairaktar.
The Ukrainian leader's office press service called this memorandum “a more real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container airport
Lviv escaped at Changi Singapore Airport.
That's what The Strats Times reports.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that the countries from which they were brought to Singapore remain unknown and to which they were sent.
One of the escape lions to the roof of the container.
The animals could not depart from him because of a nearby safety net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of Mandai Waldife Group, a member of the airport known as all Singapore Zoos.
They set up lions by means of tranquilizer wires and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Previously it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion had fled from his master and was walking around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were spared.
Specialists warned of a cancer threat due to vitamin B9
Research shows that vitamin B9 surplus, also known as phylicic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack phylic acid have less risk of becoming infected with certain types of cancer, particularly lurid ones.
However, the excess of the required dose is counterproductive to the increase in cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin recommends that the amount of phylicic acid consumed during the day be monitored.
The optimum dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if it is significantly avoided to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, having to follow dosage, and avoiding milk cotton and other foodstuffs containing phylic acid.
Previously, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Fein, called pholic acid a substance that slows the aging process.
As it is contained in the Avocado, among other things, Fain has recommended that men, after 50 years of age, be more likely to bear this fruit.
In Britain, about 75,000 people are likely to die because of the omikron bomb.
British scientists have predicted that due to the proliferation of micro-tamvirus, over the next five months in England, up to 75,000 people may die unless limited winter measures are tightened.
The Guardian reported on this by reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), transmitting the TSS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of a scientific advisory team on emergencies within the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 there would be at least 25,000 deaths due to the strain of omykron and about 175,000 patients would be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected every day.
“North response to measles may be necessary to avoid overloading the National Health Service if the micro-tams are more contagious than the Delta option, and the existing vaccines will not be able to prevent infection”, said mathematician Rosenn Barnard of LSHTM.
Formerly, the British Health Security Agency reported that if the rate of circulation of the Omicromma continues at the current level, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, omikron could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,888 cases of micron-tamnirus contamination have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of British Minsk, Sadjid Jawd, indicated that this figure could already reach 10,000.

The demand for superheats grew by a quarter in the world
This year ' s superstate and orders have been beating the world for the next year, despite calls for reducing hydrocarbon footprints and combating climate change.
In the global court register, the number of Yachts ordered was 1,200 - one quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a wish and money for a floating firm for 50 million pounds and above will not decline, says The Guardian.
However, they are growing.
This year, 25 per cent more were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it wasn't 20 years of age.
The first reason is that many who can afford a boat are afraid of land-based contamination and prefer to escape from the pandemic on their own ship.
The second is also associated with the coronation.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with their business partners personally, now the absolute majority of them work away, and the negotiations take place in the winter.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that the shipyards take orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready for a year or two earlier.
"People are just waiting for freedom, and the super-poor could have been able to afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the rich and call it dekadian.
Riches, sociologists say, don't want to realize that in times of deprivation of space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes is annoyance in society because elites don't want to share the responsibility for climate change with all humanity.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the rich, although they realize that with such a mobility of money it will be very difficult to do so.
However, it's only impressive to see the number of super-guts ordered, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of food above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Reckke builds the REV Ocean yacht 183 meters long.
After we get down on the water, it'll be the largest boat in the world.
The boat is equipped with a water pool, as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
In the existing superbs, it was common for helicopters, cinemas under the open sky, and some of them, such as MacGreeor's yacht, a camping platform, a professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, said that, compared to the total number of greenhouse gas samples, carbonic traces produced by the super-poor are not significant.
But it's symbolic, given that there's a little over 2,000 people in the world.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that billions of people have a thousand times as much traces of the average human being on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, Roman Abramović is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissary were hidden on its Eclipice yacht, 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and command him to oppress the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The superhazard owners do not have compassion for other people when, like the richest Australian woman Gina Ryand, who owns mines on the continent, complains through Utah that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels less than 30 feet [50 m] away.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer is defined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
The Daily Express reports on this.
The experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week was associated with an increased risk of oncology development.
However, the risk of developing a disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the precise cause of this type of oncology by simply noting that certain factors cause a process harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, more precisely, would like dogs to know that they are clever.
But they don't even know how well four-footed people really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out how to develop an animal’s intelligence.
Although the vocabulary of a dog is not as vast as human, a new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Science.
Dogs can't play chess or make poems, they don't understand anything about politics, economics and the arts, but they often manage to fool their masters.
Some breeders believe that experts are showing the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for precise conclusions are not yet sufficient.
For example, some breeds are traditionally thought to be dogish geese - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have found that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and that their ability to learn is not limited to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the U.S. and Russia
The US and Russia will “trade” in relation to Ukraine's entry into NATO, declared analyst Alexander Cokekov in their article for the publication “Gladred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were about to continue negotiations on United States assurances that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baden on the right of “to enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something that's deliberately unacceptable, you know, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, you're just going to fly the offerer.
And there's a deal going on against Ukraine," wrote an analyst.
Cokekov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation shall be conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, and shall not wait for the formation to recover and deploy resistance”, he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway industry
The advanced Chinese technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to the 2021 China International Travel and Equipment Exhibition, held in the town of Jozhou, Hunnan/Central China.
The basic technologies developed by CRC Zhuzohu Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and detect technical faults, noted a representative of Hou Zhavian.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with data that will increase the reliability and efficiency of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed “Chinese speed”.
In May this year, CRC Zhuhou Locomotive Co., Ltd removed the first two-stage power trains designed in China to export to Europe.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be guided by the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
A subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began to be piloted in November.
The train will be moving through a metropolitan linking the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
This metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The China Railway Equipment Industry is one of the most innovative industries and the most powerful international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yasoyan, Head of Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCNRIM/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-quality equipment in the world market”, said Feng Yazosyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development activities, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of support tools and large-scale productive activities.
According to Feng Yaossian, the country has the highest level of electrification of railways and of operating runs on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early dementia signs
The candidate for biological science, Simeon Golöshkin, in a conversation with the radio Sputnik, listed early dementia signs.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as concentration failure, planning, reduction of abstract thinking.
It is currently under discussion that hearing loss can be both an early case of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said a specialist.
Goloshakin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabole disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s and atherosclerosis of brain vessels are the most common causes of the syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to start preventing it on time.
He said that the risk of dementia development would help to reduce the risk of foreign language learning and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through play and hobby that require intensive memory and thinking logic
“There are recommendations on the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still discussed in the scientific community”, said the Golshakin.
“World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regularly training in cognitive skills and abilities through play and hobby that require intensive memory and thinking logic,” said Goloshkin.
Previously, a charitable dementia research organization in the United Kingdom stated that the disease is increasing among people over 40 years of age.
Medical experts called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first area of concern is vision problems, which make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing weakness was that experts called aphasia, a state where a person could not find the right words to convey what he was saying.
A neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, in need of psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told Neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the consul of doctors established under the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Sakakashvili] neurologic status is leading to his disease.
Constant problems are problems of movement, coordination, bias,” said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond the normative framework and that the President-electronics must now be sent to special rehabilitation.
“We call it neurorehabilitation and psychosocial rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia”, said Toidze, requiring that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
During the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after the prison officials had subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgia ' s policy was rapidly able to abolish the penalty and to restore itself to former rights.

Protests against CVID-Transports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were carried out against the compulsory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, transmitting the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, there were approximately 3,000 participants.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports became compulsory for going to bars, restaurants, sports stations, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifests came to an action without masks.
In their poster, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, a vaccination passport would also be required to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants of more than 50 persons.
Protesters in this town have announced a medical dictatorship, and the vaccine has been described as an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million coronary infections have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and over 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to impose restrictions on unvacuated persons in Russia.
The draft legislation on a unified QR code system was introduced by the Government to Gosdum on 12 November.
The Russians are expected to be able to visit sites of mass activities, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trades with either a vaccination certificate or trans-munited disease, or a medal from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trains and aircraft.

Big recovery: how Chinese become miners
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help to create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only engage 300 million people in winter sports, which will bring together the 1 trillion Yuan designated by President Cinpin, but also promote the economic development of the backward remote provinces.
The Taw Mining Kurt in Zhangjakou, near the winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being carried out on salinization: workers tend to plant trees.
There are over 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
There are problems with snow in many areas of China, including in Zhangjikou.
The main challenge for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers will become popular.
However, that was still a long way off.
The Games adviser, Justin Downs, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to uncertainty.
An increasing number of Chinese are heading toward the slopes each year.
Fiona, Beijing's sleeper, one of them.
Despite major changes, it would take many years to establish a mining culture here, according to Downs.
Many smokers are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and established in order to maintain the infrastructure necessary for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Makkong lives in Chongly, near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, in Beijing in Chongla, no local residents were unemployed.
More and more shops are being opened to trade in clothing and equipment for winter sports.
National kitchen dishes are opened on the slopes.
There's even a COVID 19 test station in Taivo.
China is seeking to create a prosperous winter sport industry, its athletes must be leaders of the largest international competition, and the Kurrts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may experience extreme poverty because of the pandemic, stated in WHO
More than 500 million people around the world can be brought to extreme poverty due to the Caravirus pandemic, which has slowed mankind ' s progress on universal access to health services, declared it at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the 12 December International Day for Universalization of Health Services, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
Thus, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage had declined, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria had increased.
In WHO and the WB, it was emphasized that the pandemic has created “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, and it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty, because they have to pay for it from their pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronary pandemic had brought more than 100 million people to poverty, and more than four billion people had little or no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister was excluded from broadcasts on the White House Committee for Democracy
Taiwan Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tan's presentation at a panel discussion during the US “Summite for Democracy” was translated into a mode without video, as shown in the YouTube summit.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was off at the request of the White House.
They reported that it was the result of a map on which Taiwan was selected as a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tan, was drawn up by a South African non-governmental organization, CIVICUS, and rank the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan has been allocated to it as "free" and the DPRK, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos and Viet Nam as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a box with a note that the views of the panellists “does not necessarily express the US Government's position”.
The PRC was not invited to the “Summite for Democracy”.
Reuters notes that the map demonstrated by the Taiwan Minister may have been contrary to the one-China policy followed by Washington.
One agency source stated that following the map, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of having shown Taiwan a country.
The “Summit for Democracy” organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the zero-day summit of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the leading editor of the New Gazette, Dmitri Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption was committed to charity.
Earlier today, Under-Secretary of the Russian Federation, Yury Averyanov, stated that the summit was carrying “Antirosian and anti-Chinese charge”.

The College of Children is one of the most extensive and well-known collections of children's silver in Russia.
It contains many fascinating models of silver spoons, squirrels and knives, graves and deserts, Poles and circles.

The spaceship of New Shepard with six tourists on board carried out a sub-orbital flight
The spaceship of the New Shepherd, Blue Orgin, with six tourists on board, took a sub-orbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
A total of more than ten minutes were spent on the company’s site, after which a passenger pod went down to Earth, reports the TASS.
The launch of a launch rocket was carried out from a launch site in the United States city of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 km, and space tourists found themselves in a state of insatiableness.
The launch rocket itself landed on the site of the launch site.
Blue Origin on 20 July successfully carried out the first sub-orbital flight of a ship named New Shepherd with passengers on board.

But how long and when they have children isn't your business until they get these kids to hang on your neck.
And if it's impossible, what kind of right do you have to judge them?
Maybe it's just in education...

The Joint Mechanism for Prevention and Control of the State Council of the PNR issued a circular requiring that the prevention and control of the COVID 19 epidemic be strengthened in cities where the land crossing points are located, in order to further prevent the smuggling of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, persons leaving the cities should provide a negative test on LOVID-19 nuclein acids obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in the cities where the land crossing points are located shall, upon arrival, pass at least one test on the nucleic acids COVID-19.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the corresponding provincial administrative units will determine and publish areas of the cities in question, up to 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID 19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Ministry of Health, a “grid conclusion” was presented between Russia and the United States.
The Presidents of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with the “Investigation”, evaluated the prospects for the relationship between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is a single-sided negative predictability, and there is an entirely unpredictable prospect of a better relationship.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have followed both with the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
“The problems didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is the US's attempt to impose on Russia a set of issues.
The MID chiefs added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts of prospects for improvement and not expected a change in Washington position.
He explained that, except for strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
In doing so, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to reason.
Previously, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with American secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to re-establish dialogue with the United States.
A virus warned of the risk of vaccination by a drug from COVID outside hospitals
A nascent COVID-19 vaccine may cause allergies and will require medical assistance, so the first points for training do not need to be organized at airports and malls.
The TSS reported this to the virologist, a correspondent member of the RNA, a conservator of bionology, microbiology and virology at the Novosibir State University of Sergei Netes.
Vaccines for nasal vaccines at airports and malls are easier, but I would do this only in medical facilities.
The fact is that the chances of an allergic response to such a vaccine are low, but it is desirable that a person will be able to sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antillergy drugs that act literally in a minute or two, sometimes very necessary," said Netes.
According to the virus specialist, it would be possible to think of vaccinations in trade centres when experience gained in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that, when using a nasal vaccine, it was important that it fall on a slippery shell in the nose.
However, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the pulverized nose is released after injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of "Supernik V" vaccine
Satellite V vaccine is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian “Sputnik V” vaccine, told the TASS Minister of Innovation and Technology of the country, Nenad Popović.
“The Torla State Institute has still produced about 2 million doses of the “Sputnik V” vaccine, and it is expected that at least 4 million will be produced in the coming period,” Pozović noted.
The Russian vaccine is said to be the most popular among Serbs.
The Republic is therefore planning an additional procurement of a million doses of vaccines in Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in the production of a visual vaccine called "Sputnik V" and a drug called "Sputnik Light".
The Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin, reported that the RF had placed in Serbia almost two million doses of domestic vaccine from Sputnik V.

In Britain, 1,239 cases of micron-tamvirus - Russian - were reported daily
During the day, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron wall were detected in Britain.
Sky News informs us about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of “mikron” strains were recorded in England, 38 people became infected with new types of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of CVID-19 sufferers from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137 people.
Previously, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine scientists in pessimism predicted that 75,000 people might die in England as a result of an outbreak of coronary fever caused by the “mikron” strain.
Sandkov warned of the suffering of Western countries that had imposed anti-Russian sanctions
President Dimitri Peskov, Prime Secretary of the Russian Federation, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” into the country.
“Some restrictions are imposed on Russia and cannot suffer for themselves,” the official representative of the Kremlin on television broadcasts “Russia”.
Peskov claims it's "understanding everything in the world."
Previously it was reported that the United States was considering the imposition of anti-Russian sanctions on energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington, D.C. and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions aimed at compensating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund.
The head of Sberbank, Hermann Greff, is confident that this is not possible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on 12 December by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5 per cent of those who voted opposed independence.
France ' s independence was supported by 3.51 per cent of its population in the South Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the ballots.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the population of the archipelag were present at the sites.
According to experts, the low level of appearance was due to the call by separatists to renounce participation in the referendum because of the Caravirus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence has already been held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the finding of an archipelagic in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own property.
They live on an archipelagic base of about 270,000 people and have a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration that allows the region to vote on its independence twice as different as two years.

WHO has tentatively considered the “micikron” to be less dangerous than the “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has tentatively considered that the “mikron” is less dangerous than the court 's delta.
There is, however, evidence to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines in a new version of COVID-19.
According to the information on 9 December, the “mikron” is registered in 63 countries.
“Productive data and a significantly modified antigenic protein profile of the strain “mikron” suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
The preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (the severity of the disease) may be less severe than in the “delte”, as stated in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all reported cases of “momicrone” infection in the EU are easily or infallible.
However, the new strains seem to be spreading faster than the “dels”.
In Russia there are two cases of omikron-stam disease.
They were “former immunized”, reporting to the Gammalia Center.
The head of Expandnastor Anna Popupov stated that there is so far no reliable evidence that the new version of the Caravirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for the Green have been named
The ex-deputate of the Supreme Council of Wadim Denisenko listed four developments for President Vladimir of Ukraine in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State might be left without the support of the West and perhaps compromise Donbas.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko presented it in a publication on the Hollywood portal.
The first option that Denisenko called the “ideal storm” implies that Ukraine will cease to support key western countries by reaching agreement on a country's future without its participation.
This development will contribute to the profound crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
" The price of key goods has been reduced in part, which we have traditionally exported " .> internal protests and opposition of power with key FNGs (financial and industrial groups.) " , added ex-parliamentaries.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation - war against all.
This forecast will occur in the event of a high level of concern in world politics, where the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
This state of affairs may give the Ukrainian authorities compromises on Donbasa, which may result in internal fighting.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Green won't be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option of the development of Ukrainian policy is to counter the opposition between the Green and the President, which is likely to take control of the power bloc and to implement the “populist initiatives”.
During this scenario of crisis, the Green will begin “reforming power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn the Green into a father of the nation.
This could lead to some event that would be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger the response of external partners and increase Ukraine's support”, said Denisenko.
Such an option to develop a situation is possible through a natural disaster, a technological disaster or Russian aggression, and is considered an ex-deputate.
The Russian side has already rejected, on many occasions, any possibility of “attacking” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity within Russian borders.
Previously, on 11 November, data from a survey of the socialist group Reing showed that the Ukrainian president's rating fell to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of its Head of State.
The analysts predicted a situation in which only 21.8 per cent of Ukraine ' s 21.8 per cent would vote in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine, while 14.5 per cent of the country ' s e-President.
Among the respondents, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed.

"Teutishko's quote gives 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Walchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A UCE student was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which hashtheg #Pattovossitrochechet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer of Euguy Evtushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the re-investigation of public action was drawn up at Alexander.
For the first time, he was detained on 23 January in Puskan Square, in a meeting in support of Alexei Navaloval.
"The purpose was to draw attention to poetry in general, and now interest in it is unfortunately lost, to the decline of a culture common in Russia, and a little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag on the Internet," explains Alexander.
We have contacted young poets to ascertain the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How did police officers treat you in custody this time and before?
What was asked in the department how your action was commented?
This time, staff members were more adjusted, the detention being as polite as it might appear in some context.
In Pusczynsk, the UONs were taken by the U.S.A.
The reasons were asked standardly.
When they heard, in principle, they saw, if they didn't, they understood.
Except for the four sides of the monkey, it was absolutely correct, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if, after an action under this hashtag, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I'm not going to be blind this 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak the Tumba-Yumba language in private.
In public and official events, people speak the languages of others so that they can understand what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in their mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's a protocol, and nothing more, by the way, Angel Merkel speaks very well in Russian and still uses the assistance of an interpreter.
Also in official events, a transcript on the old author is maintained, and the stenographer is not required to know a few languages.

The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to improved bleeding and lower cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fisholin, folic acid, and pantonic acid.
All these elements help to function the systems of the organism.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age violations.
Because of the high levels of cliché, it is useful for a stomach-to-cycle tract, and regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, it is better to cook or cook the roots for the greatest benefit than to burn on the oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetics, as well as other high - glyme products.
These are carbohydrates that are rapidly growing on sugar, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Comemersant newspaper warned of a possible lack of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in personal subservients and an increase in processing capacity.
The market participants felt that only imports could currently be replaced by a shortage of products.
Lostfilm, lodflam and other pirates will be removed from the extradition of the Endex.
Editable to fly
In 2015, the right-wing owners of the RAEC/Media cluster were listed from 100 of the top 100 pirate sites, and most of them ceased to exist, says the director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazarian.
But some of them -- Kingo, Lostfilm, Flymix -- did survive through the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, the Lostfilm, which is available in search editions of both Yandex and Google, can be viewed as a pirate copy of the Netflix "The Game in the Calmar" and "Lignity" by the film director Anna Melician, the original series of the largest video service ivi in Russia.
Kingo, who is also available in the production of prospectors, is able to look at Ancanto's anonymous news, but, according to the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen.
A TV channel, which is also available through search, is available 10 years later.

Matras Dimacks Miko Ultimite size 160x190
Orthopaedic spring matrár Miko Ultitet.
The model is comfortable with two different surfaces — high fatness and slightly higher than average.
The article includes only quality and default filling materials that have proven to be exclusively on the best side.
Springs: The centre of the model has a block of independent “miraquet” spring.
That means that the bedroom has 2,000 spirals that work completely autonomously.
It's their function that gives us a unique precise approach.
The microplastet is the highest frequency of the total variety of dimax spring blocks, so it has a strongly expressed orthopaedic effect and is considered to be pre-imposable.
Fillers: There is a combination of blankets and natural latex at the top and bottom of the spring.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a coconut.
This kind of tandrum has long been classical since it is not only an orthopaedic but also anatomic properties that transmits matrasa.
If the cyrear provides the right back support, the latex allows the surface to be adapted to the human body.
Chechol: The model is presented in a simple triplicated cheloe of Alle Vera.
If the client wishes, he can be made either as a loan or as a fixed one.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended bedroom load is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: a guarantee period of 3 years.
Matras received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm his full security and reliability in his operations.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reporting on Sunday's “Actual Camera”.
The purpose of the five-year-old missions is to assess the viability of the clouds of Venus and then to look for life there.
For the project, tobacco scientists have offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
To date, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, near the earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of a kind.
A trial from Venus should come during the third mission.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the fundamental question will be whether it's earthly or different.
If it's very similar, it's obvious that Earth's life did not start on Earth.
If it's different, it's probably more likely that life came into existence on Earth," Michael Paulsal, the head of the Estonian team of the Venos Life Finder project.

Metallised to Change Russian Business
The theme for mellows became popular in the autumn of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced his transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this was an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
So business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metallised and subsequent coincision.
Metallville should be seen as a continuation of existing trends objectively.
On the one hand, the trend towards remote interaction in the pandemic is that people are tired of separation and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
From third to third, they are a logical continuation of the digitalization of assets, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.
Ania, you're right, changing nutrition is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat and harmful anymore.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday and a traditional olive oil, and a selkie under our coat, but no one's forcing me to eat all of it right away.
You can eat a spoon, try it, and stop.
After all, the truth of ten days ahead is that you can make any delicious and useful dishes.

And someone who doesn't do just sports or can't imagine all of the hell she's gone, don't take it.
British economist could not predict the year 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict for 2022 because, in his view, such an attempt would be a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Second.
The expert believes that the following year will be filled with unpredictableness and any trend can change rotation.
Inflation, he believes, remains the most important factor.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in the prices of the goods was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the endless generosity of central banks had already outlived itself” and the time had come to return to a relationship where inflation interest rates would be subordinated to the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that, in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of an oversimplified economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new upsurge in inflation.
In addition, O'Neill summarized the issue of productivity growth as well as poverty and climate change.
Previously, the head of the Global Research Division, Mihail Schulgin, reported that the positive expectations of the dollar for the year 2022 remained, with less potential for growth.
Among the risks to the dollar was the monetary policy of the Feds, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the coroner pandemic.
I have to agree.

The Russians gave about 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to motor dealers
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians were spent buying new vehicles 2 trillion 784 billion roubles, an increase of 28 per cent over a similar period last year, is reflected in the statistics of the Agency ' s Russian Automatic Market Research (NAIP).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the Caravirus pandemic.
In the past September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
By income in the Russian market, the Korean brand is run by the Russian Federation.
During the 10 months of this year, he was able to implement a total of 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than the previous year.
Ki'a mark Hyundai's family has grown even more, more than 35 per cent, and the sale of cars is estimated to be 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand was raised by almost 21% in the average weighted car price in the year of Hyundai, up to 1.94 million roubles - only Chiangan, Chery, Galy and Mercedes-Benz were more travel movements.
At the same time, sales from Korean brands have not increased as much: according to the statistics of the Association of European Business in Russia ' s auto-producers ' committee, Kai has been conducting, in quantitative terms, 9.4 per cent more cars in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai is about 12 percent.
Starts three leaders in cash sales by Japanese Toyta, on their Rysian vehicles, spent 27.5 billion roubles in 10 months, an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75%) - the German premiumbrand has grown to 37 per cent and the average weighted price of the car (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million roubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz has also seen a good increase in sales and the average weighted price -- more, for example, than the BMW -- from here and a greater increase in financial capacity," explained the producer of the NAIPA Tatian Arabatji.
China's brands, which have also greatly increased the financial capacity this year, have shown high rates of sales. "
The Russian Lada show the average annual rate of income growth (plus 28 per cent) on her car with this stamp of rose was spent in 10 months of 229.4 billion roubles.
At the financial capacity level last year, there are companies whose sales of machinery fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, among others.
In fact, within 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion roubles on non-roads and pickles, compared with 12.4 billion roubles, a year earlier.
In the face of problems with the supply of motor vehicles and the disruptions in production covering the entire world ' s machinery, the company continues to adjust prices continuously - the same "AtoWAZ" increased the value of Lada 's models seven times a year, the latest travel (800,000 roubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices for their products and other automotive producers are regularly copied.
The volume of the Russian road market will continue to increase in monetary terms, in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of auto-concentrations to play past losses are considered by experts.
In a vehicle deficit, I think that many auto-conservators have even been able, in part, to transfer to the consumer the costs of the past, which they could not afford earlier,
says WTB Capitala, an analyst at Vladimir Bespalov's car.
I believe that in the financial sense, auto-producers feel very good right now, supporting the high marginality of sales.”
Indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the value of cars observed during 2021, the price of new cars increases faster than inflation, clarifying the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but largely by inflation and the complexity of the machinery itself, predicts the Besopa.
As supply increases, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the increase in the cost of the car slows down, auto-producers will be able to earn their income by volume, notes the independent expert on the Sergey Burgasliev road.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profit from each vehicle sold, notes Burgasliev.
The increase in vehicle production is not expected in the next six months, and the air raids are being heated in Russia as well.
In the face of the market situation, the cars were a good investment target - the car purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive than the original value, notes the expert.
Baiden spoke of moving the U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending United States troops to Ukraine in the event of Russian invasion.
This statement was made by Joe Baiden, U.S. President of the United States.
"There never was any such plan," said the head of the White House, answering the journalist's question as to whether the United States had given up such an idea.
Bayden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would experience economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using United States troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Bayden explained that if Russia invaded the territory of Ukraine, the United States would transfer forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovakia).
“We will have to send more American and Natar troops to the eastern flank, B9 all NATO countries to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia”, said Baiden.
Previously, the Russian President's press secretary, Dmitriy Peskov, stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In doing so, he pointed out that Moscow saw a problem in the military use of Kiev's droids by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

Assorty No. 2 100 per cent meridos, wool 4x10
It was very difficult to find the wool as a craft some 8,000 years ago, and the color of the wool was the same.
But now, Voila!
