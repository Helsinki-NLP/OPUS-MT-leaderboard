The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law imposing administrative responsibility for violating the time and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for public and municipal purposes.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of non-compliance by employers in State and municipal procurement.
A further two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to pay for government and municipal contracts already in progress was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia assigned the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take over the problem for special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers who entered into unfunded contracts, they tried to avoid the obligation to pay and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, 97,000 submissions have been made and 45,000 officials have been disciplined, 533 of them have been brought to the administrative authorities for the conduct of the proceedings, 75 of them, and 46 of them have been brought in criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
However, these huge amounts did not come about as a result of the failure to pay multi-billion-dollar contracts.
There were numerous, systematic delays in paying to employers for less modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
A small company leader won a multi-million rouble social transport competition.
The man invested all his working money, fully complied with the obligations, but he did not receive the fixed money for a period of time.
The result is a growing financial pool of wages, taxes, loans that would result in bankruptcy if the business did not seek help from the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017 the total public and municipal debt identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with local authorities where all violations opened by the prosecutors are dealt with in a substantive manner and with measures to remedy them without delay.
Such operational meetings this year have already taken place in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg.
The enforcement of Federal Law No. 189-FZ on the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences by the Russian Federation, which signed the President of Russia last week, will be a significant improvement in the payment of public employers' fees for breach of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works, services and services.
The draft law was drafted by the Russian Ministry of Education at the initiative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The new law would supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article which provided for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for breach by the employer of the time and arrangement for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are implemented in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit issued a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Color has published a warning for people who travel in Missouri because of the discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group reads as follows: “Preventing the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Colorful Populations, which is valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to be cautious in their travels to the state in connection with a number of disturbing incidents on racist grounds that have recently taken place throughout the state and that have been brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Color of the Population, the announcement of a movement warning had led to a recently adopted law in Missouri that made it more difficult for people to win discrimination-related claims and that State law enforcement authorities had disproportionately chosen minority representatives.
“You have human rights abuses.
They are stopped on roads because of colour, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colorful People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often more than ever.”
This is the first warning of this kind declared by the organization against the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished petrol during a state trip, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without having charged the crime.
The prevention also refers to a recent report by the Attorney General ' s Office in the State of Missouri indicating that the likelihood of being stopped on a black road is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The task of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri”, said Chepel.
“People should be prepared in one way or another to take the money for their backs or tell their relatives that they are traveling across the state.”
According to recent data from the FBI programme on hate crimes, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making the state sixteenth in terms of such violations.
Also, the prevention of movement is a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, which makes it more difficult to initiate a case against a legal entity in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued warnings for visitors to Texas and Arizona after new immigration laws had been enacted by those States, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of racially based inspections.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but public organizations have recently resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed in a police patrol shooting in Egypt
The unknown shelled a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isn, reports Reuters, referring to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two persons, including one policeman, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire at law enforcement officers.
One of the evil-doers was detained, the other one managed to escape.
Rosurism supports the law against free luggage for non-retroviral airline tickets
The head of Rosturism, Olga Safons, said in an interview to the TV channel RBK that it was “inspiring” to enact a law against the free passage of luggage in non-retroviral aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one in which the luggage is available," he stressed (TSS cit.).
At the same time, Mr. Safons noted that despite the concerns of the citizens, no payment would be required for the carriage of the upper garment and the mobile phone in the hand drawer.
"It would be right to calm all of our citizens and tourists down and say it's to the upper clothing, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the safeway, or to some computer relationship, to have nothing," said the head of Rosurism.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had previously signed a law providing for airlines to exclude the provision for the free passage of luggage in non-retroversial aircraft.
This means that airlines can themselves determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-retroversial tariff.
Vladimir Putin was commissioned to eliminate the pollution of Baical
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, reported that in recent years large areas of the lake had been exposed to extreme pollution.
It mandated sources of funding, plans and implementers to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned a full recovery of contaminated territories.
"We must also deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-ups of most of them are worn out," quote the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Russian Attorney General ' s Office should conduct an inspection of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with regard to the occurrence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreation organizers.
"I would like to emphasize this: not everything to be checked, it is also necessary to know, but it is illegal and environmentally friendly activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, he had reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of ecologically monitored sites.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territories of a special regime of protection.
He was informed of the problems of economic management by the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Minnature, Sergey Donna, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the limits of the Baikal Water Area, but in the Government of Burundi, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, since restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Minskes had proposed a solution to the problem by changing the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple Will Come Up in the South
In the village of Xosawa, members of the community of indigenous small indigenous peoples of the North, Rahtina, together with residents of the Berez region, are participating in the construction of the Orthodox Temple in honor of the clergyman Nikolai Miracle.
Its location is a rivershore, and the temple will be well-known from a distance, so it will serve as a footlight for fishers.
According to members of the community, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed, and church bellies are in place.
The Igmian WEB of the fleet provided transport escorts.
The Temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miraclemaker, since he is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a patron of dragnets, including fishermen.
In the East, fishing provides jobs for settlers, feeding them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in their school essays as a kind of local attraction.
Disnaland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore respect its laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a biting open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but he carefully stores an iron box in his office.
After the interview, a businessman goes to the nearest morning, a hundred feet [100 m] away and throws the bulls out there.
The public garbage burden is $500 local, reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex. You can't throw a fan away from a closet on the bridge, and you can't just get it.
Right now, there's a whole video.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son drew a graphite of the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a bar.
What?
Imagine.
He got ten strokes from a wooden stick over the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of physical punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the most severe laws, the AIF is at the site.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains counsel, Victor Lee Hongg.
The Government has long been concerned about both the European Union and the United States.
If a person carries or trades a large consignment of drugs, he is lynched.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defence, threatening with sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy finally hung up.
After that, the drug dealers are making a careful trip to our country.
The following is the case: Singapore is bound by laws that are binding on the EfE, not just on the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter whether you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a well-known artist, or a resident of Europe.
Option one: if you find a piece of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warnings, you just wonder how many prohibitions you have in this city-state!
For example, the chewing rubber is sold only in the pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by the prescription (!) of a physician.
The beetle will not be taken away from the visitor, but it is wise to put a cut in the subway, and the fine will be added to thousands of local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on their neck, "I'm trashing."
Over the abandoned urchins, eyeglasses, in addition to the fine, are often sentenced to "salk in the palace" — a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 roubles pay for "the perpetrator" to lose his water in the public toilet and, in an attempt to get a small need in the elevator of the living house, pulls down a special detector, locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are prohibitions on food for pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive water of room plants.
In order to avoid fires, smokers cannot carry incendiarys in the subway or will be fined by 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
Anyway, there's this idea: no matter how hard you try, you're always breaking something.
That's not the case, but it's trying to overthrow me, Mohammed Kabari, who owns a local tour agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past 20 years, I have not seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why do they keep?
Don't let the citizens relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor gets sold in a pump of cigarettes, they'll be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender will be hit with sticks at the back, and the seller will be put out and put in prison.
It is because of such harsh laws that violations in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
As early as the seventieth year, we had chaos on the roads, motorists ignoring the lights, driving as they wanted, and sitting drunk for the wheel.
After a year's fines, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, he's drinking a whiskey, knows if he's stopped, the police officer won't let go for a bribe, he's going to pay a fine at the cost of the apartment, and they'll send him for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia feel like a concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson described Singapore as “Disnaland with the death penalty”, a visitor from the United States was terrified by the general wealth of the inhabitants, the “pure airport” and the “cultural nature”.
They're not natural, they look artificial, they don't have to be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're right, you're scared to throw a boom on the sidewalk, and you're gonna get caught in the ice cream subway.
But then you come to the area of Little India, and then you're going to break the pattern, and the bus stop has plastic glasses.
"How's that?" you're surprised.
And here we go, and the Singaporeans smile.
Everything happens.
Every such crime will not be seized in place, but you must know that if you are convicted, you will not be dispossessed. You have violated the law.
Most often it's enough for a person to behave normal.
Of course, Singapore's power is completely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Hoshimina, I moved on very precautionary motorcycles often to extract smartphones and photocamers from tourists.
In the middle of Paris, there's a lot of dirty bums and beg-ups.
Similarly, not everyone in our streets is trying to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the safest, clean, safest city on earth through the recruitment of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll take your time.
This is human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one followed the driving until they started to fine.
Although Singapore’s main focus was not fines, it was voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, no trash in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who use elevators with public toilets.
That's the corporal punishment, thank you, don't do it.
In the rest, Singapore's laws, at least, cost to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
The White House of Trump now targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts to fight statues.
Americans understand this as far as everyone else is concerned - this is why they deliberately demolish the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Plain of Frados in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Government of Trump, was sure to know what he did when he took a symbolic look at the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with the journalist CNN Jim Akosté about the President ' s proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
We'll be honest, Miller didn't take the statue.
Cleaning up the owners of pleasure boats and artisans who portray the Statue of Liberty would leach him if he tried to do so.
But he got the sense of it, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the plays.
As Miller broke out on Akostu, "I don't want to go deep in history, but the Freedom Statue is... a symbol of American freedom that's exacerbating the world.
The creation of which you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Article of Liberty."
Miller correctly presented the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about the story.
It is about Lazarus, the only one in whom the State invites, not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your statutes, your poor, / your crowds, who desire to breathe freely, / the indigent discharges of your vast shores."
Never before have we seen "unfortunate discharges" on our screens.
Miller didn't do the literature, he made it clear that in America, the Trump people aren't waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to place her words on the floor of the statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing an entirely political act.
The design was to mark the link between the French and the United States with a banal classical figure, a female image of the Freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the woman’s poems — the woman’s figure is no longer abstract; she has a voice.
And she's got a different name: the mother of the missing.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist march and a devastating attack against American nationalism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, even though he was right to change it.
The Gromous Rasch Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who brought about the Trump, reasoned in 2010 that freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early non-conservator of America's flame in the darkness of the world: “Freedom is coming forward.
She's carrying a torch of freedom from the United States of America to the rest of the world.
Falkel doesn't need to light the way to the United States."
It really came to the point against Limbo's usage.
The mind of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus ’ great creative achievement was to see her, as she would have been seen by her exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of the ship after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who look for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Its statue responds with the words of hope and hospitality that they want to hear.
And of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch needs not to shed light on the path, but to fuel the hatred that is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom Assembly.
Elyd Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scottishs in the United Kingdom.
Neil Blake, director of the U.S. Federation's Games for Light Atlas, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Cup would make “a significant contribution to the team's game”.
A rare number of Scottish light- travelers were selected for the London Championship on Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland there is “a special thing coming up” and the Federation of Small Atlantics of Great Britain should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand it, and we will maintain it while they have the potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Atlas thinks what they've done is to work.
The British Federation of Light attics: with what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things are so good, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some Scottish athletes claim to be medals, including Laura Mör and Andrew Archert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Eilid Doyle, the team elected its captain.
"Elides is being modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many light-wings, whether Scots or not, and from where they live or exercise, have left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings Eiled put into it were wonderful."
The owner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth champion who, at his fifth World Cup, is going to break the distance of 400 m, says that 16 Scottishs in the British assembly are "unbelievable."
The previous record, by the number of Scottishs in the World Cup, was seven, 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muer is on the way, a middle-range nationalist and has beaten five British and two European records last year.
She'll win 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who's going to be running at 1,500, is another Scottish man who needs to be brought to the attention: behind his back, he had a successful season, where he won a British pavilion competition, and an annual competition.
Doyle remembers her first championship in the world when, apart from her only Scottish on team, Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says she's "unbelly proud" because so many of her compatriots have not only entered the collection but in some cases will claim medals and fight for final entry.
"The collection team chooses other team members, so it was an honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were elected, this is a very special thing for me," she added.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scottish people who entered the assembly.
This shows how much we've done.
And they are all light-litts who will strive for a playper's honor.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I was just drawing attention to the fact that we were very lucky to take home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from sick people and take advantage of what we're going to do again at the Olympic stadium.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and get involved in the competition, and the atmosphere is going to be great."
Locking on Facebook critics: You don't have to move to public office unless you're willing to listen to the voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticize him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The scream of him was, of course, annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "We can take out freedom of speech, and we, deaf and dumb, will lead us as sheep to battle."
Now I'm going to move to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and wiped out a minimum of 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The subordinate governor called this claim a null one, and a comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "us and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's important too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a Hogan guy.
He's an amazing republican governor in the state's democratic advantage.
He's second in the rating of 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reacter.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the management of the state and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary way of communicating with his voters and with jokes, showing his face on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, to block people who come to the governor's page -- who are declared to be an official public forum and are being paid money by the administration's taxpayers -- is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the Washington Post interview, Security Secretary Amlia Ches defended the Governor's action, claiming that blocking comments is just a model.
But it's too easy to use the image of the trolls, the spams and the gamers who abuse the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls -- the teacher, the businessman, the pastors who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not harsh.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to Hogan’s Catholicity.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramán of Bowi, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary to the article in the Post.
“I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it's a so-called tough thing, instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens.”
What subordinate governors call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "active living position."
In Facebook's age, it's easy to falsify your image by simply blocking your critics or washing your negative comments.
It's much less rougher than ever before when it took people to do it, to collect and burn newspapers with critical forebearers, or to arrest and shut down the protesting mouth.
But that's exactly what's going on now, just in a figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were caught in his Twitter account.
One of the first decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Cheris, the chairman of the Laudon County Observatory, violated the First Amendment by getting the elector into his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin made claims by the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
That must be not so hard.
At the time of Washington, D.C., the available postage costs were roughly the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely disturbed his credibility.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
The people under the pseudonyms of Turricola, Valerius, Belisearius and Porcius wrote letters in a newspaper mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online paper, his office was filled with petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very foundation of our State.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronne Rafferty hopes for household convenience at the Renaissance Club
The former European championship Ronn Rafferty looks forward to a comfortable home for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotan will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf coach for senior athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who was in the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsu, attached to the new location, and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Gerry Sardadi Club.
“I saw the renaissance club build up, and we see it come to a successful conclusion with this event,” said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at his best, it's in excellent shape.
Jerry did a great job doing this place.
He has a strong commitment to this game and prides himself on his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils is looking forward to the first time in the championship despite the fact that he won his 32-year-old career at the European Tourna, and in the European School of Justice.
"This is indeed a special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I was unable to replay Extremadura Open," because it was removed from the schedule one year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a beautiful golf place.
Last year's memories are returned, and for me and my wife, Sharon was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returning to battle on native land of Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour for senior athletes after he had attained 50.
This event will be the first to appear in a public in Scotland, with Aberdeen Asset Management Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to be good, but you feel that extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed a good golf.
I'm pleased with the way everything's done."
In the field, three will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Wesem, and the tuner champions' champions' champions, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former captain of RadioCup Sam Torrans are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the rest are Andrew Aldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmeir and Ross Drummond.
It's free to participate in the tournament, and the parking lot costs five pounds an hour, if there's one person in the car, and ten pounds if there's two and more people.
All income goes to the U.S. Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads are learning to absorb harmful emissions
The own tunnels over the highways that can absorb carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the British roads.
The transport agency of the country, according to Autocar, reported on the positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests installed on one of the highways in the north.
A tunnel of 6 metres is made up of some of the latest polymers that can absorb the harmful substances contained in the car exhaust.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tonnages is only part of the massive measures the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English are going to expand the network of power stations for electric vehicles, carry out a number of activities to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial transport on electric power lines and upgrade the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgord changed the penalty for a fine for a disabled mother
Mosgord imposed a fine of 200,000 roubles on a disabled person, Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment.
The TAS reports on this.
The Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the term of detention by explaining its request that Mamev's disease “restraints him from prison conditions”.
28-year-old Anton Mamiev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving a sentence in the general regime for the robbery of which he was the victim of a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man at a visiting meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesia ' s Golden Land
When he's ready for lunch, Bardin Degei doesn't use a stove.
She doesn't even look bitter.
In its village home in Enarota, the capital of Paniai district in Papua Indonesia, the housewife usually simply contains sweet potatoes, which is called a note, right into the hearth.
After a half - hour period, an icy tuber is picked up and eaten with impatient, impertinent hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – the furniture doesn't exist – and it's here that she's doing her work in the house, like a cloth of dim water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is rampant here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk the village after five o'clock," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highland colony of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by raising their hands publicly before the occupying forces.
The existing movement in favour of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strong control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea is located in the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotas are as remote as abandoned; the road includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, an administrative centre of the province, in Nairobi, and then a five-hour crash on a hired car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with corrugated roofs painted with rust in a variety of red and red.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, papuas mahogos were worshiped by a god named Uga Tamei.
Other changes have been made.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degay, pointing to her bright, straight-hand turban, dark soup, and a bright shirt.
"The sooner we wore only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live below the poverty line and the rates of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest gold mine, Grasberg, located in Fereport McMoran, is only about 60 miles [60 km] from Panay, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015, Freeport obtained some $3.1 billion from gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest stocks worth $78 billion.
These riches, however, lead to one misfortune for the papuas, guaranteeing that Indonesia ' s powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation into the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demand for greater autonomy on the part of the papuas threatens the existence of this gold house and is ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventieth year can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 9,300 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the British diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electrical defeat – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to count the number of victims because there are events every week,” says Andreas Harrisono, who conducts research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyanas have been prolonged, as Papua ' s resources have attracted resettlement flows from other parts of Indonesia.
3.5 per cent of the province ' s population is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulaves.
The Javan laurgi sells roasted chicken and a mixture of vegetables called Gado-gado, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand competition.
“The migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables at a traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 20-year-old Paniai, who moved to Jayapuru, the provincial administrative centre because of his work.
"Because of this, the indigenouss of Papua, Mam (women) Papua have lost their marketing market."
Indonesia's President Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter engaged in the support of 27 of the 29 Papuan districts, including Paniai.
But Papua has not changed much, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokov, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says Joo.
In fact, just two months after Jokovy Paniai’s inauguration in October, she was in a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and were singing Christmas homings at the Lobby in Enarota when two Indonesian soldiers escaped from the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should include headlamps.
According to local pastor Jávet Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended at their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, the drunk soldiers followed and beat children with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was so beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone buried a nearby government election committee building, and the next day the situation got worse.
About a thousand Papuasian men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows, and they carried out the Way, the dance of the papal tribe, the pagoda, running in circles and painting the bird’s drink.
Some protestors have started throwing stones into the police office and military base.
When the situation struck, an order was issued for the soldiers on the inside radio link: “If the crowd is to resist more than three times, shoot them,” he said, in an official document that was seen by the correspondents of TME but that was not published in the local media.
The 50 - year - old Eremías Kayame, head of the Kogo Koto area in Enarota, felt threatened and called for calmness by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist,” he told the magazine TEME, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayma still doesn't know who shot, but says the bullet came from the shering of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
Three times in the local resident of Alphaeus, as reported by his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," he mumbled out a magazine called TEME, which, as many Indonesians, use only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Jotge Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papua Police, told the reporters that his officers had only “protected” their base because they had been attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us”, stated a police representative, Papua Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more wounded.
The murder news only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a dusty speech in Jajapur, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future”, he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately, there were objections.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the virgins or at the beginning of the zero.
The point is, of course, we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to go through," he said.
Viranto then gave up his word, speaking to TEME on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will be determined through judgment."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 East Timorese bloody vote for independence, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including in Paniai.
The families of the victims from Paniai have met with such statements with a grim lack of confidence.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johanes.
“I am tired”.
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, afraid that I will be shot."
His brother Jacobus also felt that the Paniais were afraid to discuss the accident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at village residents in a nearby Paniai district of Diyai.
During a clash between villagers and the building company manager, who refused to help take a man without consciousness to hospital, killed one person and injured 17 others, including children.
A man, 20th - year - old Ravianus Douve, who disappeared while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The disheartened villagers protested in front of a building site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian specialis) started shooting at the crowd and killing one person.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” reported TIME’s 20 - year - old Domingg Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded arrive in a hurry.
"I hid at my house for two days."
The Diyai Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade withdraw from the region.
Drinking has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development has been causing frustration on the part of the Mee tribe, Mony, Dany and Dalla tribe, scattered throughout the territory of Papua ' s green-covered central highlands.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuas by carrying out sporadic attacks and flying with kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Judas Khoia.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and allegedly detained by the military under the pretext of “defense of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered a “genuine, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases frustration.
The small portion of the rice sold in Enarota is too expensive for local residents.
The bread is not exactly available.
People here are growing up everything they eat -- mainly the notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most crops for the family, and the rest is sold locally.
Ten tubers are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have increased between indigenous papaas and new migrants, who have arrived in large quantities since the introduction of new flights at Nairobi airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually won by more educated and wealthy migrants.
The papas rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Little people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no job or money here,” says John Gobay, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escuudi and Basel Lonchen were deported from Papua for “unsolved consistency with the organizations concerned”, even though they were rarely allowed to carry out the video.
According to Felim Kine, Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi election campaign have not been met to lift restrictions on the media to promote transparency and development.
“For now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are facing new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, the six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “a variety of and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting at Paniai.
The same countries have in the past been supporting the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanta Nasir, waved the statement of the group, informing journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights abuses”.
The locals want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kis van Baar, visited Ja 'pura on 4 May, the locals violated silence by praying: “We want freedom”, as the source claims to have also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will take place in 2019, but the papas say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokow.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobay, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, except that they live in the shadow of threats from the Albanian army, are in poverty, and that education and health are in poor condition.
Gobay says that the people of Paniai, like the rest of the parrots, consider their voice to be behind Jokow's, the debt he must pay for.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting led to the execution of the last symbolic act of disobedience by burying the body of one of the victims at the site of the land in front of the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is likely to never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"The members of our family were killed," said Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else should we do?"
Fire for the second time covers the oak skyscraper Fakal
The fire seized one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday morning, forcing hundreds of people to leave the 750-day-story structure at 337 metres high.
It's a second fire that's been hit by a high building - called Fakal in two years.
The building had been evacuated and human casualties had not been reported, nor had there been any prompt news of the fire.
“ We slept and woke up from fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to drop off the 50th floor,” reported the Reuter, a non-scene resident named George.
According to Dubai’s Civil Defence Authority, firefighters swept fire at about 4:00 local time (00 p.m. to Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The event can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the display sites of high buildings around the world.
An investigation by Fakala administration after a fire in 2015 revealed that the most affected was the crying — the outer panels used for formalization and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believed that the isolation system and the crylet panels of the Grinfeld Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire that took place there in June, resulting in the death of some 80 people.
The increase in tourist flows in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, 125 persons or 0.6 per cent more than in the same year, were employed in June 2017 by hotel facilities in North-East.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and foreign tourists have increased.
For example, foreign tours increased by 7.3 per cent in June (544) to 7,794 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 in comparison with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 persons from the Russian Federation stopped at hotels in Ida-Viruma.
Andrei Malakhov gave an understanding to worshipers who were responsible for his care
Andrey Malakhov showed his worshipers at Instagram who was responsible for his departure from the High Channel.
So far, he hasn't commented on rumors, but today he put a fragment of the article in the Home magazine for 1 August.
Malakhov's picture was signed with "Pyssus Psychos."
The article on how to prevent the worker's “heating” and to draw attention to his condition.
If you remember a lot of reports that the lead couldn't find a common language with a newly arrived producer who was about to reform "Store," it becomes clear what he's so transparently hinting about, writing "Cr."
The television broadcaster Andrei Malakhov was reportedly currently on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First Canal.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when a car exploded
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, passing over RIA News.
According to the police, on the eve of the night, a mined car blew up near the military in the Girishk county.
Twenty dead are known.
On Friday morning, a new CP took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Dyver filmed a video of his shark camera.
Dyver and researcher Greg Skomal recorded a video of a shark that bited his GoPro movie camera.
A Roll has been set up on Facebook by a unit of the American Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is a staff member of the Socomal.
The incident took place on August 2, off the coast of Cape Kod Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Nicn portal.
The man, during the underwater voyage, tried to remove the shark on a camera held on a special stick.
Seeing the human being, an animal over three feet [3 m] long came up to him.
Akula began to bite a camera without trying to attack a scientist.
He explained that the predator had done the same way to determine if it was possible to eat.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that such a sea animal’s behavior proved to be a news item for scientists.
The cause of the fight in the Ural war centre has become known
A working group of senior military officers of the Central Military Region visited the Alan Training Centre to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this slaughter have already come to light.
According to Mash, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, contractors in the Hungarian military part of number 316112 were severely beaten by an unmanned bed.
It started with the fact that a private Sayan had demonstrated his rejection of an officer’s order to order a flimsy simple.
Military personnel from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Saina supported her first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were hacked into a barracks of bed and sinking, and glass was knocked out.
More than ten people were affected by the fight.
IT WAS denied information about the nightingales.
The study found that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items into the aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air travelers deliberately or accidentally carried banned items on board aircraft through the United States Transport Security Administration inspection sites, including a minimum of 6 per cent on board, to avoid being seen carrying prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found themselves carrying firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study carried out by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more inclined to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were million compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The most common dish and water are food and water.
More than 3 per cent of the respondents admitted that they had been specifically carried out through the examination of sensitive items, while 2.2 per cent of the women ' s respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried banned drugs on the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport inspections and how much they had done.
It is expected that, most often, consciously or unknowingly, smuggling by means of searches by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of ATB are rather complicated and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry and how many.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATBs might be considered prohibited by the passage of books.
Jews are allowed on inland flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the Obama emission reduction regulations
The following day after the action of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama Regulations to reduce emissions of air pollutants leading to education.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a suit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The battle began around the period of 1 October, to which states must meet the 2015 ozone standards at the land level.
In June, Prutet announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year in order to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “responsibility to local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who was appointed President Trump for his current position as Attorney-General of the State of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental norms.
Following the move to Washington, D.C., Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations against the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The sudden change in course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the Pittt course in return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA chapter had exceeded its authority in an attempt to postpone the implementation of the Obama Rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Prute proposed that, by dramatically changing the course on ozone standards, he simply complied with the EPA ' s obligation to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of implementing the new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to meet the target date, then waiting for action from groups of activists and others, and discussing the time frame for the settlement of the case,” said Prüitt, who filed more dozen lawsuits against EPAs at his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the time frame seriously.
We also take our statute and the authority that it gives us.'
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prüitt may at some point once again use its “loyals for delay and other statutory powers” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdphys on a clear course and on all available information”.
Republics in Congress insist on a broader revision of ozone regulations.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney-General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that week's action against EPA, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
“The change in the EPA course, after our lawsuits, is an important victory in the struggle for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who were able to directly affect their cities,” said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C.
Ozone at the ground level arises when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources are exposed to sunlight.
The result could cause serious problems in breathing for people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the sudden change in the Prute course.
"It is hard to think about how much pressure has been needed to achieve this quite logical step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute air and their special interests”.
IAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russia Federation of Light Atlas
The Congress of the International Association of Astroletal Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the removal of the All Russian Federation of Light Atlas (WFLA).
In this way, Congress supported the WFLA IAF council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be retained.
At the extension of the suspension, 166 people voted against 21 and handed over to the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions established by the Council for the restoration of membership, but that the conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of VFLA ' s disqualification of the World Cup in London, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
There were 19 people admitted to IAF.
VFLA was subjected to indefinite dissension by IAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Panda, which described numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes, was then published.
For more information on the latest IAF report of the IAF Board, see IAF's “IAF extended sanctions on VFLA”.

Within 3 of the Vinbet-Prime of Russia, the new Khmick TFL teams conducted a visiting match against the Kluga FK.
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played between themselves in Russia’s cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
"Hymick" never gave up on the opponents, but a second relaxing at the top of the match led to the wrong head and thing.
After a recent defeat from the Kalshogan, with a check of 0:3 many prophesied in advance for the easy victory of their masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the newcomers had forced themselves to be considered and acted by the defence, but from the position of force.
In the 1st week, the calories were more cooperative and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very qualitative match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who on several occasions reflected dangerous blows and gave the partners confidence by his actions.
Unfortunately, Chimik's attack lacked effort and effort to put the Kalugi's defence impasse and strike the first head out.
After the break, the game began to run at a meeting course.
Newcomers were more active in the attack.
The alarm calls to our team were a mistake in the defence, which allowed the calgoans to create a number of acute moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemick took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the Kaljan's experience has played its part -- they've done a little bit more literacy and cooler, they've spent their time at the gate.
Following a dangerous attack, Chemick moved the ball to a corner, which the masters of the field, without resistance, moved to the gate.
The nud was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Chemick showed a good game, but suffered an injury.
Our team is on its way to another exit - on 11 August, at the Torpedo stage in Moscow on 19 August, the newly-soldiers will fight the Kentre group "Arat" of the FK "Arat", which includes Roman Pavlüchenko, Marat Izmalov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebco.
Come and support Chemick!
The site and meeting time of the newcomers is 18.30 minutes at the Mangolia store (Eastern, D. 2, Corp.

According to published telephone conversations, Trump published Mexico regarding payment of the wall on the border
The Washington Post newspaper published telephone reconciliations between President Donald Trump of the United States and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone interview with the President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nyata Trump insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President was running him for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to the reports, said to him: “You cannot speak to the press.
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia has also been published.
Trump told Ternbull that an agreement requiring the U.S. to accept refugees who went to Australia, “sympathy,” “deceptive”, and insisted that, because of an agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot, because it intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation, saying Ternbull that “this was the most repulsive conversation of all day”.
The bodies of travelers killed in Abkhazia were sent by aircraft from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to Russia, on board the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia's Rossia, left at 20:15 hours in Moscow from Sochi to St. Petersburg, passing over to TSS.
At the site of the end-point, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City City Mayor, would meet with journalists, including the Deputy Minister of Curtors and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
The representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs had previously stated that the Government of Abkhazia had taken over all expenses related to the removal of the bodies back to Russia.
In addition, it is the official intention of Sukhumi to provide the families of the victims with compensation of 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the authorities of Abkhazia expressed their willingness to pay for the families of the victims of the bombings to overfly and reside in the Republic, but the relatives sent only the confidence of the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at approximately 16:20 a.m. in Moscow, two explosions were found in the village of Primorsky Gudadout district at the rocket-artilleric weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defence, followed by the detonation of large-scale weapons and other ammunitions.
As a result, storage facilities were burned, causing uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
As a result, the PP killed two Russian citizens, Elena Polakova, born in 1970 and Elena Timofev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a serogenic source.
64 persons, including 35 Russian citizens and 29 Abkhaz citizens, were brought to medical facilities with various injuries.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the remaining ones being discharged.
A study of the Russian influence on American elections will take over a large jury
The Russian prosecutor Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to examine Russia’s influence on the election of the U.S. President in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The big jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be studied by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The summons of a large jury gives Muller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son, then a candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalai Wesselska.
Müller himself has already promised to check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Junior had expanded the staff of her lawyers.
Trump, who had previously told him that he had been waiting for a staff member from Dipartia Hillary Clinton to meet with Wesselska, but that no disclosure documents had been submitted, and that this was the end of adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that the Trump Jr.'s statement to meet Wesseltica had literally been inspired by Trump-old.
In the White House, it was said that the president wasn't saying anything, but just using his authority, what any father would do.
Pensa Vice-Mier was detained in the workplace
The Deputy Chief of Administration, Penza Irina Shirshin, was detained for 48 hours on instructions from the Investigation Committee at his place of work, reports RIA News.
Official reports from law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been received, but the UK press service has assured that they will soon be followed.
There's no comment on what's happening in Penny's mayor.
Irina Chirsin is one of the five deputy heads of the Pennsylvania administration.
She has been in charge of urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
Until then, she had been working for a long time with the head of the State of the State of the State of the State of Pennsylvania.
Irina Shirishina raised three minor children, noting that she had remarried her mother a year ago, refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there are no cosmodrome or carrier rockets in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of the tower of Yuria Gagarina is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are taking place in some countries, Hagarin monuments, on the contrary, are “wheating by the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was installed in American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space mission.
There's a ghagarina monument in Germany in the town of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited 1963.
A monument in Carlovy Varah, Czech Republic, escaped the demolition in 1992 because of public protests and was moved from the city ' s centre to the area before the local airport.
The 70th anniversary of Hagarin in Riga was a monument to Jurius Gagarins.
That's how the name of the first cosmonaut is called in Latin, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Murder at Mores Ford: activists lose Linch Courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Merkuri, in 1948, we drove through the sights in the village of Monroe, in the state of Georgia, and waved to the little bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with rifles blocked its way.
The main male middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip was drawn up with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people sitting inside were trembling from fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" called out a man.
Get him out of the car!
As the young black man was dragged out of the front seat, the prognosis were broken.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is just an incest.
But when the Roger's neck was put on a loop, almost all the spectators were actually holding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Seas Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when the dollxclads were lynching two black couples Roger and Dorota Malk and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It's amazing that no person has been arrested in all these years -- although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the situation.
"It's a spot in our history and it's a rock on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who has always fought for human rights.
For him, the show is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must have justice," he says.
“We cannot turn to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice”.
A coroner covering the simple body of one of the leaching victims at Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI obtained by En-Bi-News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in leaching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two of its motivations: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling allowed for the first time to allow black citizens to vote on industrialism, which was to take place that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester, a white landowner, for the apparent reason, a woman.
Brooks says that, according to the hearing in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Doroti's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorota and their cousin May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and came to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lazy people surrounded the car.
“What Harrison has organized and commanded,” is the conclusion of one of the FBI reports.
“It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state law enforcement agencies and cities that not only participated in the killings but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt at electoral rights," he says.
"They all were killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city, and if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene is running an annual show that reproduces the leaching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
It's watched, it's captured by the audience, and it's talking about the deep racism that many people would like to think there's no more in America.
It's hard to watch and it's even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's the most important thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch's courts because they show us our own deformities," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear that I've been through."
This year's performance was launched in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors, a dozen whites, the other blacks, gathered in a room and listened to a play that had been swept over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role did not make it easier.
"I feel as if I'm getting scared because it's not the man that I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the placement of the Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon actors playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, they repeat their roles.
It starts with Malcolm sleeping with his wife, Dorota, screaming and pushing him.
'I said go to hell, get out of my house.'
The Rascon screams in reply.
There's a blow.
And at the same moment, all (at least all black actors) are cut off by the hospital.
Green laughs more like everyone.
"What's that," says Asuna.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I winning?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the white people used to say nigg."
"Yes, yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to carry the hard "p"."
And the energy in the room is changing, and the discomfort is changing with the sense of friendship.
All must do what is right, not just for the sake of play, but for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascon speaks the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
Spektock ends cruelly and rapidly.
Screams, shots, then silence.
A woman in a surly black dress stands over the bodies of the actors and plays the sad song of Billy Halliday, "Strange Friit."
Her voice is interrupted by word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat out of their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Sota, New York, to see the performance; many live quite nearby.
They had endured almost eight hours of George’s hard spirit while Brooks led them into pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolms and Dorsey.
Until then, the murder had remained a story, but now that they are at the same place where people were lazy, it seems that their ghosts are hanging in the air.
When the last song is choked, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch blood paint, and live bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy fighting, as if reminding himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green gives thanks to the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors throw ropes out of their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the lead doll.
Nick Rascon embraces two other actors and, suddenly, weeps, falls into their arms, and the emotional load of the playquet finally hit him.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You have had reasons for that."
Later, the audience will sit down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta discuss the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Dalplinski is hard to find to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible words, horrible words, and acts... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the liquefy is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police call the shooting."
In another corner of the room, the general attention was given to Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender behind him.
He says he's already started planning the next year's presentation.
"The stop is encouraging us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't draw from this lesson, it might happen again.
Those who do not know their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalov for violations on the “Aguitation Sub-Bull”
The court of Simons of Moscow fined Alexei Navoval 300 000 roubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20, paragraph 8, of the CPA of the Russian Federation, “Practical breach of the order of organizing a rally”.
Previously, the Judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hiszir Moseskaev, completed the administrative proceedings in respect of Leonida Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the opposition, Alexei Navalov, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navival.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets in the “Aggitation Sub-Bull”, which was held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitarys following the members of the Saturday, the police believed that the organizers had deliberately hidden his true substance, a public action (which had to be previously requested from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Jedanov and Alexander Pomazouev filed an application for termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and indicated that police officers had failed to produce a protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the “Agilator” itself, but he received an agenda that required him to appear in the police station to report an event with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by the Navnal and another speaker of the opposition, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, the shot bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The Mordoviya court arrested a local resident who shot four people, including a bride, at a wedding.
This was reported to the National Investigation Committee.
The incident took place in the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, 42-year-old Saranska shot several times at a gathering in the village pond.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings were initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (“Hulgany”), article 30 (3), and article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (“Trafficking for the killing of two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner from hooligan motives”).
According to InterFax, local media reported that a man was shot because the wedding guests, when they decided to sneak out, had taken him to the water station.
Minergo tightens requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the regulations for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines are launched, HEC turbines, oil transfer facilities and equipment suppliers are required to share data on access to it from Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government regulation has already been prepared and has been made available for public discussion.
The new requirements would address only “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as receiving information and access to the management of foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
On 4 August, the EU Press Service stated that anti-Russian sanctions had been increased by a scandal surrounding the transfer of Siemens' turbines to Crimea.
This has been reported earlier on "Tunings of the Week".
The EU Council Press Service stated that sanctions against the Russian Federation had been increased owing to a scandal against the Siemens, which had allegedly been brought to Crimea in violation of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries to expand anti-Rosian sanctions.
Previously it was reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and that was the decision that had been taken, the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pirson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to get business back into life.
On Friday, the British Education Group, Perison, announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce preliminary dividends by 72 per cent owing to the launch of a regular restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems faced by their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to John Felon ' s head, will occur mainly at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, occur in addition to 4,000 jobs reduced under previous restructuring.
Pererson announced that it planned to reduce the cost of another £30 million ($394 million) during the third cost reduction programme in May to try to get back to a business that was hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Beersman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after she announced an increase in the sale of the main product by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to $2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldiers died as a result of the suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and interpreter were injured, as stated in NATO's communication.
According to unverified local data, three civilians were also killed in the Carabakh area.
The explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday, as a result of a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people at the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
According to NATO, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint convoy with Afghanistan's army was attacked by “a man driven by an improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and to be treated at the United States Military Hospital at the Bagrama airfield.
Respondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IG) in Carabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to United Nations reports, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent were in the capital city.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing on a vehicle caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had attacked.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a powerful explosion in the center of the city — the most serious number of victims of terrorist attacks in the country since the Taliban had been removed from power in 2001.
Violence is emphasizing the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States assesses whether an increase in the U.S. military support needs to be made in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the Government, its course of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following judicial action, cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Act, which requires States to limit emissions from air pollution one day after 15 states have sued the Agency for this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone 2015 measurements”, emphasizing that this step was an expression of the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in and respond to dialogue with our state partners”, said Scott Pruitt, director of the Environment Agency, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced in order to comply with more stringent air quality standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a complaint alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to push back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at brilliant economic growth, according to Trump.
But actions in this direction have led to the resistance of democracies and natural organizations, concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of ozone-free air for air breathing “may increase the function of light and respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
The European Business Association has opposed new anti-Rosian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The Deputates ask the police to restrict movement on the beach in Pscow
The Szach People ' s Elects sent a petition to the Chief of the Ministry for the City of Sergey Sorin on the issue of movement along the Great River.
Drums Constantine Bolotin, Grygory of the Lesnikov and Valeria Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the Territory safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the "Pedestrian Road" and ride freely along the coast.
Capital repairs and improvements are expected to take place.
Sports and children's landings are becoming unfriendly because of cars.
According to the Pscow Information Agency, during the evenings, the central coast patrol is provided by members of the PPS and the wife ' s Motoratorium.
They reduce the number of vehicles travelling, but they continue to move completely.
Putin demanded that the investigating authorities not remove hard disks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, proposed that the investigating authorities should not remove the servers and hard disks from the operating computers in the businesses.
The Head of State reported on this at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary “to exclude the use of measures for the purpose of investigation leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from computers and servers”.
Putin noted that, if the investigators had such a need, it was “to remove, assure and use copies during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible to “determinate the conditions that prevented the business from continuing to the extent that taxes could not be paid”.
Olga Buzza told me how much she wanted to call her ex-wife.
The television broadcaster Olga Buzov admitted that she wanted to call a former soccer man, Dmitri Tarasov.
At present, the fame is located in the U.S., which deals with business issues.
The previous day, Olga was visited in Las Vegas, where he decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not made new tattoos, nor had she named her former spouse with the words that he had ruined her life, even though she wanted to do so very much.
Buzza said she'd remember this trip forever because she was having a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelias Faj's Minister of Magic in a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the 92nd year of life.
The Independent reported on Thursday.
The actor was told by his relatives about his death.
He said that he had lived a "lost life, successful in film, theater and television for 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltham.
In 1959, at the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in "Trigedia about Koriolan".
Hardy also remembered the repeated performance of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's roles, including one of the screens on the works of Agata Kristi about Ms. Marvel.
He was awarded the award of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-si "Winston Churchill: The Worldness Years" 1981.
Robert Hardy also had to act as president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something missing in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henry Marie Jean Andre, Count De Labord, refused to be buried with her vetous wife, Queen Margrete.
This year's four is a gold wedding, but the couple's agenda is not about the preparations for the celebration, but a heated argument.
His Highness refused the title of the Prince Consort, and he dropped the queen's name, which he never complained about before.
Henrik lives in France, although she remains officially queen’s wife.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Washington to stop coughing Moscow.
In Russia’s MID, they responded to Mike Pens ’ remarks that accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement by the foreign policy department was circulated some time ago.
In its commentary, the MID pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold-war images, which are inadequate today ' s realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop coughing the Russian Federation.
As Argments of the Week wrote earlier, U.S. vice president Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vassili Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive mate
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily toward holding the most exciting boxing match up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They held separate rooms at ESPN office premises in Los Angeles while Garcia, an unconvinced champion in the light of the World Bank Council, was walking through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Cooperation Organization champion in the second half of his weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former championship of the world in the four weight categories, Airian Broner on Saturday, on the Showtime channel, both boxers are in the fifth of the best fighting groups regardless of the weight categories.
Zechariah stretched out his right hand and said: “How are things, champion?
Good luck with you."
Lomachenko defends her belt alone with Miguel Marriago on Saturday afternoon at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers asked for a picture, Manager Lomachenko Egis Clymas noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would be the very first time.
"I used to be in a half-weight," said Garcia.
"I went to a category for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I don't have enough for 140.
I want to get down to the lungs.
And he has to get up to a half [up to £ 135], and then we'll be alone.
That's what sick people want.
Let them do it."
Lomachenko agreed.
Bocksa needs this alone.
Climas asked whether the fight should be carried through PPV services as part of the strategy he had followed to ensure that Lomachenko would carry out its debut fight in the weight of 135 later this year in order to appoint, for the next summer, a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who was also interested in fighting the winner between Jorge Linárez and Luce Campbell, after they had been fighting for the title of the world champion in light weight at the Fram on 23 September.
"The battle may be on PPV, because all the sick people have asked for it," said Garcia, expressing her willingness later to impact on a channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
Once they're ready ...”
Garcia said she thinks Lomachenko is a "smart boxer" and might be visiting his Saturday party.
But Lomachenko didn't sleep right away on Garsey's commendations, and he said that in his opinion, a champion in three weights from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the impact and then the boxing.
They both said they feel the tension in front of their own privacy.
"This battle must take place.
No other battle is so interesting and interesting.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: “I was expecting one of the topless boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great battle."
On several central streets, Moscow will block traffic on weekends
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will restrict in the capital the movement to a section of the Tver Street from the Nastasin crossing to Triumpal Square, as well as to a traffic in the 1st Tversky-Yama Street.
In addition, travel will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yam Street.
On all sites, closures will operate along both lines, reporting to the Transport Information Centre of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The police will close from midnight from 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their improvement.
Also during the weekend, traffic at the Moscow coast site will be shut down.
The construction of the Zabbiye Park is ongoing.
Putin commissioned the Genprocture to check out Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, instructed the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of Baical territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please check the Baikal Territory for illegal and ecologically harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for action if the violations were identified.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who had been subjected to a new medical assessment method of age, showed that more than 80 per cent of the protests had been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all believed in the accuracy of those results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migationsverket) criticized for not having been able to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far Migationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the tests were evaluated as 18 or older and in 25 other cases the forensic medical agency estimated that the tested “probably 18 years or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the judgement stated that the person “is likely to be less than 18”.
The test shall be conducted only in cases where the age of doubt is doubted.
According to Johan Guernsson of the forensic agency, the results corresponded to the results of past months.
“We don't see much of the difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate”, he said to the portal, “The Local”.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of the 581 test and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely the age of 18 years tested or greater”.
However, after having considered the 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, an individual had openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of carrying out a medical assessment of the age of making X-ray teeth of the wisdom and the typeography of the knee joints and of giving them to dentists and X-ray scientists has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have gone through sex earlier or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think I should take advantage of the methods of measurement that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to pretend we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Guernssen of the Judicial Medicine Agency argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk can be said to be wrong when a child is taken for an adult.
We are faced with the greatest risk when a person is 18, then he's about 10 per cent.”
I'm wondering if you're going to run for president.
During a working visit to Burundi, Vladimir Putin said that he was willing to think if he could stand for the presidency of Russia in the 2018 elections, he passed the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request made by the villagers of the village of Nasmuk Bourtsk region.
During a video conference on the destruction of the fire in Burya and Irkutsk region, the interviewer told Putin, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you that, when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to stand back for this post."
"All right, I'll think, thank you," said the President.
On 28 July, the Russian President's press secretary, Dmitriy Peskov, commented on some media comments that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by the head of administration of President Robert Wyno.
The singers called these assumptions "not on the basis of the hypothetic reasoning."
"As long as there's no headquarters, before there's a headquarters far away, before the election campaign," said Pekov.
"As long as this isn't on the agenda," Pekov said.
Governor of West Virginia said he went to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justins, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Trump, which is going to another party.
“It is or not, but the democracies have moved away from me,” said Governor Justin.
“I am speaking to you today with many prayers and many meditations,... today I am telling you, the people of Western Virginia, that I can no longer be of any benefit to you, being the governor of democracy.”
Myting blew up with applause.
"That's why I'm going to change my registration for the Republican tomorrow," added Justin.
"As coach, I'd tell you that time is different."
Trump had earlier promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia meeting.
Trump won 42 per cent of Virginia in Western Virginia, and Justin did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justin, who according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic Party issued a statement that “The move of Governor Justin to another party is another blow on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to hinder than it works to make our country great again”.
“In considering only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justin's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leader and is unable to find a positive message”, reported a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna Macdeniel, in the statement by CBS News.
Mr. Krasswick found a house thanks to the social media
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Cravesczka weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous because of the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a cat photo was published in a pet account in Facebook asking to find his host, because "he's obviously been fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's face could become a new memorial.
The publication gained more than 3.2 thousand lamps and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people have expressed their desire to hide Mr. Redbowk.
As a result, he was put in the hands of Angela Frazey, who promised to take up his weight.
In an interview on the WNCN radio, the American woman told me that she had had experience like this: she took a cat home weighing about 10 kilograms, and now she weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to Australia's cat with unusually long paws.
A post with a picture of an animal collected more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she would be able to make a career in a model business.
Kou praised Russia's “surpassing” apology for the Doping Scandal
On Thursday, the International Light Attaché, Sebastian Cough, commended Russia for calling sincere apologys on the ground of the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is no time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Atlantic Lights, Dmitri Pathin, reported to the Congress of the International Association of Light Federations, which had been held on the eve of the world championship on light athletes, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was just and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen in competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Autonomy Federations voted in favour of retaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a record of evidence of the state-funded use of doping.
“I felt very sincere today’s response,” said the report president of the International Association of Lactial Federations of Coo.
“All the council and all the Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself would admit that it had been a very hot time and was now doing its utmost to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Kou said that he also felt that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” said Kou.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was that we want to separate the clean athletes from the debased system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, in accordance with the strict criteria of the International Association of Automotive Federations, will participate under the neutral flag in the Peace Cup, which will begin on Friday in London.
On Monday, the head of the special commission of the International Association of Auto-Federal Federations, Runne Andersen, stated that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
As he reported to the reporters in London after a report on the Council of the International Association of Autonomy Federations, drug testing is still not conducted in sufficient amount, and the remote trainers are still quietly carrying out their work.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of having been hospitalized
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (UMS) is sending a journalist, Vasili Muvaritzka, into custody for two months, to the SBU.
The web site officer, Gitomira, is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian sites and attacking the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
However, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering this to be “war policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the flow of illegal migrants with the CPA.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which does not, however, control most of the territory of the country.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobukru accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Foldmarl Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, it was stated that they did not believe in these threats and that they intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Paolo Jentiloni and the head of the recognized Libyan Cabinet of Fiza Saraj, Europe.
The Italian authorities have undertaken the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegal migrants from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
In the Government, it was stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A major crash occurred in Skype
The global failure of the Skype service has been recorded today in several countries around the world.
Users started sending complaints to programme developers on Thursday, 3 August.
In Microsoft, experts were already actively working to address the problems faced by Europeans and North America, clarifying the RIA's News.
Recall that in June of this year Skype also crashed.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the collecting Ukraine on light athletes have been suspended from participating in the CMM
The Earthk and Oleia Poss, who are specializing in short run, are excluded from the collecting Ukraine at the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the site of the Federation for the Light Atlas of the country (FLAU).
This decision has been taken by the executive in connection with the establishment of the International Association of Auto-Trafficked Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings for light-cells.
The Ukrainian delegation also excludes trainer Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
The poach is a bronze winner of the 2012 Olympics 2012 and the 2011 World Cup, a Europe-2010 champion in the Estaphete 4 100 metres, and the Earth is the winner of the European centenary in 2012 at the Estafé 4 400 metres.
The World Cup World Cup will take place from 4 to 13 August in London.
How football financial rules will affect Nima's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record of the Neimar transfer from Spanish “Barcelon” to the French “Pari Saint-Jerman”.
Whatever the effect may be further on the chain, for Parry Saint-Jerman by WEFA, the governing body controlling European football, whose authority prohibits teams from participating in the prestigious Liga champions.
From the FIU rules introduced in 2011 by UEFA, it is clear that SFJ will eventually have to show that the Neimar transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Nemara’s move to France.
The SWG can definitely split up to hire Neimar and add it to the other stars ' galaxy, taking into account the team's funding from Qatar's rich energy of the ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the cost-effectiveness threshold of their football business.
FOP led Michel Platiny after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French football player felt that clubs that were hugely indebted in their pursuit of success were, in fact, stinging and risking destruction if banks or owners had ceased to finance.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on debt clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this business model change, which was originally used by Roman Abrahamovic in Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with good potential and then to spend heavily on improving the team and creating a global brand, it became difficult to meet the plan.
During this three-year evaluation period covering 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite the disgrace that Platiny had been removed from the presidential office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive costs.
FOP is alive, and as we move forward, we are going to tighten the rules, saying last week to Associated Press, Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP in UEFA.
While SPF will pay the price of Neimar's contract, it may, for the purpose of counting, distribute the amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Nemar signed a five-year contract, so transfer value can be shown annually as cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the “PF” as well as the Abu Dhabi “Manchester City”-owned “Manchester City” imposed the most severe sanctions.
A fine of Euro60 million (it was $82 million) was imposed by SPF, which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and it was ordered to limit its team to Liga champions during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to intercept its financial inspections by spreading their income against companies associated with owners of the club.
Although a Qatari company could offer SWFs, if the amount of funding was considered to be higher than standard market costs, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of SWF on the part of Qatar's Tourism Authority was inflamed.
It was reported that part of Neimar's income to SWF could have been paid by the organizational committee of the Peace Championship in Qatar.
But SPF and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the world champion of the championship, and such a manger could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SWF mean that UEFA will be more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, those who were familiar with the situation did not have preliminary discussions with SLG about the Neimar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of SWF.
According to the latest reported report, in 2015-1016, SPM earned more than 10 million euros at a rate of €542.4 million.
Reporting for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
SPF expects Neimar's arrival to be a propitious ground for sponsoring, selling attribute cards and team logo T-shirts.
At the club, it is assumed that trafficking will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably angry at leaving one of the best football players, the Spanish league tried to prevent Nemara's transfer, claiming that SPF would violate the financial “fair plume”.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” stated the Spanish newspaper “AS” to President La LGe Havier Tebas, in view of Qatar's final owner.
Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnet, shares the doubts of La League over the financing of the club by the State.
"It's all the implications of equity, and it's completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years," stated Thursday Hungarian.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to keep up with the financial fries, because countries can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and place of oath
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law has drawn up the State Law Committee.
A week ago, members planned to directly determine the procedure for the oath of law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those who are not effective, will be released from the final text of the amendments to the RF Citizenship Bill, which the Committee will consider at its second meeting on 11 July.
President Vladimir Putin supported the undertaking on 6 June of an oath to join the Russian Federation's nationality in lieu of formal signature of documents during a meeting with Speaker Gosuma Vjaceslav Vladimir.
The Deputates have amended this idea in the form of a second reading to abolish the decision on the extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 2, para. 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for the flight of aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 4 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill is that when a person forms citizenship documents, he is signed in accordance with his promise to comply with Russian legislation, which he has set on the path of extremism, he is in violation of that promise.
In April, the bill was introduced to the State of the Rudmir Vassiliev (Edinus Russia), Gennady Zughanov (CPRF), Vladimir Girinsky (LDP), Sergey Mironov (“Just Russia”) and HD Speaker Váceslav Vladimir.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Hospitality and Legislation approved the second reading text, but it has now been revised.
It now says that the order of oathing will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Previously, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, indicating that the ceremony was to take place in a solemn setting before the State herb and the flag of Russia, in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - the list of places where the Federation herb could be located was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of government of the entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal executive branch, etc.
Most likely, it could also be the Clerks.
A solemn oath to obtain the nationality of the Russian Federation will be made once the officials verify their documents.
But a person’s Russian passport will be obtained only after the oath has been sworn into, and the text that has been finalized should be finalized.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn into oaths from 18 years of age rather than 14 years.
The rule that the oath will be released from an invalid or restricted capacity, as well as from those unable to make, read or sign the oath by hand.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and from “other persons”,
The updated bill also describes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainians who are considered to be Russian.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian nationality by making a declaration to the authorized authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notary certified copy of the statement would have to be sent to the Russian officials.
Absolved from “extraordinary” nationality, as it is now, would not be necessary if provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-President, GD Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Phonsky, Paul Krashennikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all of whom are “One Russia”).
I think many of you know that it's not possible to get a statement from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a great deal of people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding the nationality of the Russian Federation, explaining the previous day to the head of the think about the hospital and the legislation of Paul Krashennikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on certain posts for foreigners would not extend to those who refused in writing “other” nationality and had issued an earlier passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond the control of it” did not cease to be a national of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office in the municipal service, being recruited to work at facilities and organizations that are linked to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or residence permits of another country may not become a member of the Gosduma or a member of the Council of Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017, and the necessary regulations must be prepared by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a waste in the American summer and the Detective's Terre détat.
The current repetition of history is nostalgically similar to that of the '80s characters; the '90s border era (about the time when eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Savuter made a billboard for the MTV); and the year 2001 itself, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Radd moved to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both an exaltation and a reflection of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a rosy, she seems to be anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original history of the coffee bank spoken by H. John Benjamin).
The result is a doubling of the main joke: middle-aged actors are playing sexually concerned children, who have just reached the age of majority; thus, it is impossible to get back into a joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have played, has less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more sloppy and includes rigs from steel film-making in the 1990s, like "Rocking Scurvy."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled cokes, and "whispers of other things since 1991."
Many staged moves are the same.
Good-natured Koop (Schoouler), now writer, has yet to gain reciprocity from Katy (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still with virginity.
And there's also a mad and mean conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (then Shawwater) is now incited by George Bush, an old man.
As always, the best part of the fransy is the retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radda snooping around Matt Dillon's song of "The Single One" whose character, last big man Andy looks old now.
The success of this french could be random madness in a kind of recursive series called "Seven Up" until it comes to what I think would be the logical conclusion: "The U.S. summer is 20 years later," where in the last scene the entire company would go to a movie at the Prime American Summer."
"The detective of the Amazon" refers to another type of nostalgia: the cold war memories of "American", "Blonde", or even "Blesk" with its images of fighting the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Director Riz Thomas, portrays the TV show: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheistism and the Marxist-Lenish road.
The main role, the vision of Gregor and the idealist Joseph, are played by Florin Pierresic Jr. and Cornelia Uly, and their dialogues were presented in English by Chining Tatum (on the other hand, the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levet.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are some visual jokes (Police spend time watching chess games like Americans could watch football).
A team of famous people -- including Jenny Slate, Nick Offferman, Mahershala Ali and Hloa Sevini -- makes it interesting to play "up to your voice."
But "Tursue Detective" is so holding back for the truth of an uncluttered propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which is often what she looks like.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not very, very often.
If it were to be done in a short time, the "Pharaoh Detective" could be better able to cope with his sweater in the spirit of an aggregator; for example, whenever Gregor and Joseph arrive at the American Embassy, two fat men sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To think of the Communist figure, this image says that Western culture is capable of doing whatever you want to do with it.
This isn't exactly the wrong thing that the Romanian film writers are making: we're doing that with our own recent story, and so are theirs.
The Russian Super Bowl Cup T-shirt between Spartacus and Lokomomotive would be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian soccer Prime Minister (RFPL) Sergey Poldkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFP, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there are almost no cards left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomot will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
As the TSS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion and Lokomomyt is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young physiques cleaned up the furniture chains by 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old official with a furniture firm called to the police the other day.
The man claimed to steal expensive tools from the tash, which caused serious damage to his production.
Productive wolves became tools for the total cost of almost 200,000 rubles — two welds, a perforator, a hydrate, and a winch.
Orders were wanted and soon went to the inhabitants of the Badkortostan region, who had been friends for 23 and 24 years.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices entered the company's territory, broke the entrance door and removed the tools.
Immediately thereafter, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first lost car service.
They have already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement officials have succeeded in returning only some of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
Gosdep commented on Medvedev’s words on the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hiser Nauert, in response to the remarks made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dimit Medvedev, concerning the relations of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FF a full trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert recognized that Russian-American relations were at a “low level” but noted that there was a need to seek “opportunities for interaction”.
"Look at the armistice in south-west Syria that's been being observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of the good cooperation of the United States and Russia," cites the words of RIA News diplomat.
However, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The new sanctions bill for Russia, Iran and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in the past.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "growed" rose rose from amethysts and quartz
A French fashion house unit named Dior - Dior Joaillerie - joined Rose Dior Bagatella and Bois de Roce.
They have five new wheels and three cols on barhat tapes.
Two new rings and amethylon of amethysts, rose quartz and diamond were released in the Rose Dior Préttlán line, which was carried out in the fabric of the glyphics (hand rubber on the rock) and the gauze on the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joalerie Viktoire de Castellan was inspired by the rose that grew up in his estate in Granville by the fashion designer Christian Dior and the Paris Gardens of Bagel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deteriorating relationship with Russia
The U.S. President Donald Trump made a strong criticism of the Congress.
According to the leader of the United States, their actions had led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia has been very low and dangerous.
"Maybe thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
On the previous day, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea.
In particular, they affected Russian banks and power companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to enter into beneficial transactions and would further bring the RF, China and North Korea closer together.
A Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter, Sberbank
Viktor Procopenja, an employer from Belarus, withdrew a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary unit of Sberbank.
The business leader explained to the RBC that it was intended “to focus on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
According to Mr. Prokopokeni, such a step will be a “better investment of time” despite the investment attractiveness of buying a daughter from a sberbank.
Mr. Prokopokenia became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after, in July, the NBU rejected the application of the consortium of NorvikBank Grigoli Guelnikov and the Belarusian company Saida Gucerieva.
The Russian banks began leaving the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Petropotenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to the WTB and the Unsheconombank, Sberbank became a member of the financial community.
The new name for the blackout in the Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation called it the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, explained the situation.
He said that the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck that hit the accident set up electric transmission lines, resulting in the removal of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
The disruptions in the electricity supply to major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists removed the problems for several hours.
It was initially reported that the blackout might have been an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakened inflation have caused rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain poor, leaving interest rates unchanged from growing pressure on family incomes.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) representatives voted with 6 against 2 for retention rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer members in favour of an increase in the rate this month, because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that increases in rates over the next few years would be needed to control brezzle inflation and said that it was likely that the cost of loans would have to be higher than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the complex economic development measures launched a year ago by the bressing.
Since next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, which it provides to banks in cash, although it has reported that it will now have another 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds in this plan.
In the decision-making protocol on rates, the bank said: “The growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is in the near future slow, while pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for a “some tightening of financial policies” of a few more than the market expected.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all increases would be “flexible” and “limited”.
The Bank's projection of an increase in this year and the following year is lower than that in May, which was 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
A pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rates had weakened the expectations for growth; GDP had increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth would likely remain 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it would start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The latter account of the inflation bank gave little reason for the joy of households affected by high inflation and a very small wage increase: the Bank said that pressure would increase before lowering.
The Bank added that the financial policy “could not prevent” was successful in the next few years, but expected that wages would be recovered “significantly” by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also driven by the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low rate of pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent in the past August, following the shocking results of the referendum on withdrawal from the European Union, which had led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its last decision at the rate, there was a noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly pressing on strong household pressures: three of the specialists in the committee asked to raise the rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, with 2.9 per cent in July, although the Bank reported that the fall was expected to be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher figure than the planned 2 per cent is the result of a low rate of pound.
Andrew Montleik, director of the Korean Supply Brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent fallout of the raw courses, it seems that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors demand business capacity and expect a good end to the year.
The market is especially favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, since refinancing, often with no commission, and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The public health service will record a controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on financing a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-expositing HIV (PREP), a pre-sexual pill that had been proven to reduce the risk of infection among persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service within the initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld last year's High Court decision, which stated that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay the PEP, despite her claims that it was to be financed by local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by England’s National Health Service, Simon Steven Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Agency (NAT) called it a “backpoint”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, the veterans in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Scheffilde will begin to register the people, and even more will join the programme in October.
Pre-transmission prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV-positive drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to studies, PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
At the adoption of the PEP before sex, a sufficient number of medications are available in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dyspercers will withdraw suitable participants who have agreed to the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practice doctor in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and England ' s National Health Service signed a drug contract this week after the international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the potential of the PPI for collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, how it is recognized and applied on a large scale.
“This critical innovation must complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone over three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PPI, if properly directed against people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk for HIV will be able to access a new, open-ended tool in England without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is rapidly launched throughout the country, and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we receive a PEP pilot drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The Tennei Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodjson, said: “We very much welcome the start of the PEP test, and it is very late due to months of Government delay and delay.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of the PPI.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect those at risk of HIV and move us a step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatar and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (TAC) adopted a resolution that noted the importance of preserving the presidency in Tatar.
According to the document, the post is “a strongly recommended form of the organization of the supreme State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the distinction of powers between Russia and Tatar.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnic, socio-economic and social and political development of Tatar and Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that since 24 July 2007, the treaty between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the deputies of Gossovet Tartarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the name of the head of the region.
At this point, Tatar is the only member of the Federation who has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called the President.
In Russia, difficulties arose in obtaining international driving rights
GIBB units face a shortage of international driving permits (IEDs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait in turns for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to leave the country on their car or rent their car.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has been introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on a particular police or traffic office: some require an IDP, and some people have sufficient national rights.
In order to be careful, drivers of international law do receive international law, but it must be borne in mind that the non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Mexico, Indonesia) have the right not to recognize national rights or the IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all HGDD units, reports the “Commersant” by conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, the HIDD units are simply not issued, and the forms are not sufficient for four months.
You can register for the guest service site, but it's in turn that it's already stretched out to mid-August.
In the Krasnoyarsk region, it is impossible to obtain “for technical reasons,” without being in detail, honestly saying that there are no forms, similar to those in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already experienced problems, and social media reports are increasing:
Irena Burmistrova: " Guess why international law can't be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all HIBDE offices have completed their forms.
Elina Podkolzina, "Ask to those who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time, they've been killed far ahead, and there's no tablets in the place. (There's a button, but there's no table.)
It's like a public service portal that shows in Spub of time free to figs.
Has anyone ever tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the State Department for the State Inspectorate.
That could be a deficit, but it was not clear what changes were being made, and it had not been previously reported.
Blanca buys the Special Road Safety Centre (TSC) of the IWAC, and then supplies them to the HIDD units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the AO “Ginick”: almost 200,000 forms of ISS were manufactured in 2014-2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the GS for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that CSN just failed to run the tender on time, which has caused the deficit.
However, there are other instances of lack of form: the crisis has caused many people to travel on their own, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so forth.
What rights are taken there until the end is clear, and so people are re-protected, and so there is an overwhelming demand for international “creatures”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made this suggestion.
The new model has been in operation since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, said that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he told an interview to the "Ospital" portal.
No respected international company would even put a bolt or a hook in it because it risked losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan -- in countries that had joined sanctions against Russia on the Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project do not really exist," said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia is also unable to construct smaller sites.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stages of destruction have already begun.
"For this reason, I think the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that are so short-sighted to join the project," said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a set of Krima Bridge roadworks.
A huge assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed on the Locking Bank, with a set of 45 metres from the base of the building.
“Simultaneously, bridges prepared for installation at the fairway pillars of the railway arch”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, Head Mintrans Maxim Soklow informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was well ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
A ten - year - old official was dismissed from Spain
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) did the chief Spanish official Carlos Recio have?
It's been a ten-year permanent walk.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
Not his direct boss.
What's going on in the world of bureaucratics?
The fans seem to have long been used to all the charms of "the servants of the people."
And yet officials are always able to impress those whose taxes they live well on.
This time, the “sension” complained from Spain.
There, an officer in Valencia Carles Recio's archives managed not to go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular compensation.
It's worth 50,000 euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's "great times" ended.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the course of the investigation, it became apparent that a vicious walker had come to the office every morning at seven o'clock to observe the electronic system.
And I went home.
Once again, he appeared at 4:00 a.m. in the workplace to celebrate again in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years old.
It also became known that all the time a walker devoted the drawing of comics to the home.
Representatives of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think about how to punish and direct Mr. Resio, who could not have known how to “exertly work” his subordinate in his workplace.
Judges are invited to protect themselves from the presidents
On instructions from Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts should be limited and that their election should be introduced.
For the courts of appeal and appeal, the HRU wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential commission.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
The work of the HR Committee was conducted on 3 January 2017, on instructions from Vladimir Putin, which the President gave following a meeting with members of the Council.
During the meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016, discussions were held, including individual cases of arbitrary justice, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see “Illa” of 9 December).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that dealt with both the independence of judges and the identification of errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If a judge was successfully selected and supported by the judicial community, the President of the Court would, in the opinion of the HRC, have to present him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to sit between judges.
To do so, experts may be allowed to do a specially written computer program.
The HR Committee also considers that the President is not entitled “to specify the results of the judicial qualification, to initiate disciplinary action, to decide on additional payments”.
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed to the “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and to “give them authority for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are now appointed President for six years to represent the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressures from regional administrations, the HRTF proposes to re-establish appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the FF.
The HR Committee states that “several courts of appeal and appeal bodies should be organized, not at the regional judicial level, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judicial districts”, which do not coincide with the administrative division in the FF, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using telephone law.
The HRC proposes to strengthen the people's hearings to consider, with their participation, some “cities of civil and administrative affairs”.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on the restoration of work, on the protection of honour and dignity, on the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained the PHRC member, the Constitutional Court judge in the resignation of Tamar Morzzova.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only confined to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (VC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still a time to carry out the assignment of the VC (in the middle of the perpetrators - the Genprocurature and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the FF in ensuring the independence of justice, President Vjaceslav Lebedev is due to be held before 1 September.
To live well: Half-strates and clever designers have turned this little apartment into a simple home
Joan Lee, a former banker involved in real estate repair, moved from a simple house in Naytsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the sympathetic typical house in Queen Anna's style, and for the sake of new design, it says that Joan didn't gather his things and didn't move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment to Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price of the same day."
Since the first inspection of the apartment, a total renovation of 1,000 square feet of square feet had been carried over.
It was originally an apartment with one bedroom of complicated planning - to get into the bedroom, had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage spaces and half a century to get the most out of the generous ceiling.
"I wanted tall ceilings, big windows, lots of lights.
These were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Herfan Azadei from the Notting Hill architectural and intelligence studio "Duck & Shed" to use the ceilings 12.5 feet high and create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be useful to Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to house two buildings one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-story, where full growth could take place.
Erfana had to think creatively to cope with the reef.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to make room for them to be alone, and we did not have to bend down.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to burn the structure so that it would be at the right height and allow for the use of the top and bottom spaces.”
This decision allowed Erfana to build two full-time rooms each over the other in a remote area — and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-circuit through the ventral of the copper light window from the "Rétrovius" opens a view of the steep sitting-room below.
Green furniture with a golden compartment, silver accents, and veneer lighting instruments from Serge Muya apply to the project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of vision, space and light.
The short corridor is marked with mirrors to make it look longer.
On the kitchen, the mirror shield looks like a window into another room.
In the entrance, mirror closets are used to store the entire container of Joan.
To create a sense of luxury, the beauty of the living room may be a barrier to the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving door up like a garage.
"The art of engineering has been used here," says Erfana about an armed steel wooden shield door.
"She's made with a counterbalance, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slide."
With reasonable utilization of storage spaces and sites, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be," says Erfan.
“The real estate agent will come in and calculate on the basis of the sex area”
Here they have been able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that give the spread of luxury.
"The mothers are what we touch, so they help to build an emotional bond with the house," says Erfan.
"No one likes an electric conduction in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt our hearts."
This is evidence that with good design and an enlarged apartment floor, it can become something of a general sense of shock.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decree has been published on the Government's website.
According to the document, the commission ' s main task would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, define tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
A Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed by the Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitriy Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy policy by 2030.
The Plan includes 193 activities and measures to enhance the influence of Russian culture in other countries, the preservation of a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of a culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to an eight-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in G20 countries has fallen to minimal in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OED estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent, lower in October 2009, when the price index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a decrease of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
Thus, the department registered the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation Targuet in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
Miners, however, believe that the focus has already been achieved - according to the agency version - is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal cut-off of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development in natural Baikal territory.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donno, noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
He permits deforestation during firefighting, and the Government plans to take it in autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that “not everything will be cut off in a row”.
Donne noted that this bill involves monitoring by MTS and oversight agencies.
Media: The UPU members are in secret from the command and agree with the Donbass militia
The Donbasa armed confrontation has established regular telephone calls.
Contradictors communicate on mobile phones constantly, and they are not aware of it at headquarters.
The WSO and the Donbas militia have established communications on cellular phones in isolation from their high command.
On 4 August, “Strana.ua” refers to the participants in the Donbas military operation.
According to the publication, team commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some sort of tactical arrangement.
In some cases, the result of such talk is a reconciliation at a certain part of the front.
Journalists were informed of occasions when an officer was congratulated on the day of his birth because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
The UPU and the NAM and LNR militia sit in the trenches on the line of separation from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against the Donbassa.
MID has resented the blocking of UNSC allegations of attacks on the RF Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy department, it is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the United Nations Sobbezia in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the FF Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry.
It was recalled that the Russian Embassy's territory in Damascus on 2 August was subjected to mortar shelling on the part of terrorists by Hayat Tahir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat Al-Nusr, banned in the Russian Federation) and Makak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and UNSB resolutions call for the opposition to this structure, the IID REF noted that “it would seem to be obvious that the Nusra terrorist attacks should face universal unequivocal and strong condemnation and that there should be no ambiguities in the assessment of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as emphasized in the dysedia, “the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine before the Security Council, alternately with the tone of objections, covered by the arguments of the alleged lack of necessary information, stopped the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital.”
Failure to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain in the conscience of those delegations.
“The most disturbing fact is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity” stated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “the barbarians do not wish to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is at the same time with them.”
Vladimir Putin spoke for limiting the number of out-of-planning business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, stated during the investment project meeting in the Far East that the number of out-of-plan business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, and said that it was necessary to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Non-planning checks shall normally be carried out without appropriate coordination with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent shall be agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office; the rest shall go on their own”, quotes President TSS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prevent investigators from removing servers and hard disks from businesses.
Furthermore, according to the President, business integration should be entitled to defend the interests of its members in court.
“It is my hope that I will take some position in business-related cases or in breach of the law in the business sector,” said the Head of State.
Other types of business inspections are increasing because of the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, at the request of the Russian President, Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, which revealed that the actual replacement of scheduled checks had taken place out-of-planning (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and civil statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (1.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details about business audits in "Plaim" "A Little Business" came from the other side.
Brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in the state of Victoria in real estate trade worth more than $500 million -- forty years after their Italian ancestors established a dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton football club and founder Colin de Lutz live in Turka’s palace, three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him before the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a bitter divorce dispute.
With her mother, Anna’s brother owns 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars since his family bought a shop at Smith Street in Collins in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and De Lutz's family list of property includes today office buildings, construction sites in Brunsvik and Sorrento, gold bank apartments and Mount Butler and shopping centres in suburbs.
According to an agreement with the late father Colin, whom Paul describes as “the main driving force and dominant identity” of the De Lutz family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin ' s property is 316 million and Paul ' s property is 176 million.
The property and money section was a stone to Paul.
"The division that Colin proposed gives him, in my view, the best of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings in the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who's going to control the existing business, which in Paul's view, Colin excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but blames Paul for the incompetence of the management of certain sites.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he said he looked forward to resolving the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs grow as a snowmight: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Parts and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides attracted the most well-known lawyers, including Queen's lawyer, Allan Meyers, and the best.
Mrs. De Lutz and her late wife, Luigi, were Italian immigrants; they had run milk bars and gastronomics since the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunei in the early 1970s.
They bought a Collingwood store under financial guarantee, where Collingwood opened Colin's first family pair of jeans.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was a boy"
Anna De Lutz says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their possession to sons without conflict.
"Luji often told me that she didn't want the brothers to meet in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutz; Colina has received 10 million when he got out of business and Luke is 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “satisfied with the financial conditions of their branch”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGhir's biology published in 2015, the best friend of televisions.
The Frankfurt Media on Friday was contacted by Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied in a text message stating that since the case was not yet before the court, “I don't really have anything to say”.
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and to touch the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote statements that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "the conflict is still in the hope of resolution."
On Friday, that hope must have been scattered.
"The decision in our case will soon be delivered by the court," wrote Colin.
The new head of the Trump office plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
“Political” reports that the new head of the White House office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the chief in a more calmer state.
That's what the reporter Josh Dosie reports.
“At a meeting held by John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House office, with the head of the office on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he hopes to resolve: the bad channels for getting information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it, in paper or in briefings, because the President would be better to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is quite true, but others have failed in trying to put down Tramp by tracking the information.
President Trump's relationship with television has evolved a few decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Trump, a candidate, complained about the unjust coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he was given fair coverage in publications that could have been overcome," said Sam Nanberg, former Electoral Staff Adviser in February.
Tara Palmerie wrote in Political, that “as six former members of the electoral headquarters said to be in control of the Trump habit of writing to Twitter, there was a need to ensure that there is a constant flow of praise in the personal information coming to him.”
Okay.
But the idea that the Trump habit of writing Twitter was ever "under control" was just funny.
Maybe these election headquarters members know something that we don't know -- for example, if they didn't, the Trump Trump cables would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn't publish.
If his staff kept him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one could always hold the Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
A part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump material that is reliable or not, which confirms their views.
"Politicus" -- just to this story -- wrote in May about the propensity of the advisers to keep giving the President questionable information.
Here's one example, described by Shain Goldmaer, reporter:
"The new and former Trump staff say that Trump can respond very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not be calmed down until they find who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone put an article with GotNews.com to the president, the Charles K. Johnson Internet relations site, where the deputy head of Katy Wellse's office was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson was always wanted in Twitter for aggressive behaviour, that he didn't present specific facts, or that he started false accusations in the past and then turned his back on them.
Trump read the article and began questioning the staff about Wells."
Goldmaer adds that the then head of the Rance Pribus apparatus and the secretary of Rob Porter “was trying to build a system to manage and document the currents of the paper received by Trump.”
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
Maybe he'll be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Tramp's still has a spirit of momentum, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office is struggling with HIV.
The Public Prosecutor's Office challenged the Kalininin City Court order that the criminal case against a local resident who had lost a young daughter from HIV died.
It is alleged that the child was killed because the mother was a HIV-positive woman who refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability for reconciliation with the victim father.
The Public Prosecutor's Office believes that the crime cannot be left impunity without creating a precedent for other HIV-didents.
The case concerning the Tümen woman was initiated after the 3-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman was not treated alone and refused treatment for her daughter, believing that HIV infection did not exist”, explained the Tümen District Prosecutor's Office.
A criminal case was brought in the Kalininin City Court of Tumen, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The application for this was made by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “the wife, the claims against her, had no harm and apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and filed an appeal asking that the decision to discontinue the case be reversed and that it be referred for further consideration.
The girl died and could not make up for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the doctors' recommendations, refused to investigate and treat the infant against dangerous infection,” reported the Office of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
According to the oversight body, she should be punished, otherwise she would be followed by other HIV respondents.
According to the Tumen Centre for AIDS, about 12 children living with HIV are currently in the Tumen region because of parental denial.
“And this situation has already improved - one year in the work of a special group, half of the parents who have categorically refused to treat their children with HIV, has changed their opinion - has allowed them to perform diagnostics, take drugs,” said Elena L.
She said that it was not possible to have a legislative impact on parents and that not all HIV-positive children were able to be detected, mothers were unable to trace, hide, and run away from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV/AIDS?
At the end of last year, Pyerburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV dividend movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and who refuse to take drugs.
Health professionals and AIDS-care activists call these views anti-medical, and their dissemination poses a serious threat.
A gruesome photo session that ended in the tragedy occurred on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greeka railway station in Hmelniksk.
A busy company of raised young people was walking along the rail road, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective selphs on the roof of the wagon, reports FACTAMA in the police communication sector in the Kmeltsk region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness, he got stuck behind the transmission line and was hit by a current.
Fortunately, it became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called the "rear."
Before the doctor arrived, the victim ' s doctors were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized to the Khmelniki Regional Clinical Hospital.
Men were diagnosed with burns of between 1 and 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
The rule of law reminds us that transport is now becoming increasingly popular in recent times, with extreme selphs on the roofs of multi-strateges, bridges.
The police called on people to be vigilant and to avoid such photographs, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of the oceans in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus, the oceans could exist.
French scholars made this suggestion.
Professionals have developed a computer model that demonstrates water formation on the surface of the planets, says Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans with 10 per cent more water than is currently on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were wounded in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were shot and handed over Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a significant number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them seized the gun and started shooting at the people.
The appearance of the evil-doers could not be considered, since they had everything but the eye.
Another was treated, after which he was released.
The third shot is a minor, there is no details on his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a night club in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
A rock band in Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The Luna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album, “The New World”, which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The college is preparing a conceptual show that will become the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"The Second New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous opposition novel O. Haxley, "On a Strange New World."
The new songs do not tell us a book, but they tell us about a society that lives by the law of anti-topia, "a blind belief in propaganda and imposed values."
To collect money on the album, the audience was helped by the project supporting more than 1,200 people on the Plata.ru website.
The first album, "Make Gramche!" Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the X time plate, and in 2013, they recorded the album "We're a Louna" (2013).

The group has won a number of times in different hotels, the "Chert Dujin" company.
The Tsgans crossed the lair and returned to the Millionaires
Some of the richest homeowners of West Midland are again in conflict with the strong Roma who have crossed the moat of the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field near their homes.
They parked 20 houses on the wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solihala, which had been called the “millionaire street”.
Having brought horses, babies, and numerous houses on the cols, they returned after being expelled from their homes no longer than in May, and they did not interfere with the moat that had been dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their incursions.
This tactical company found a gap in defence facilities and contrasted its vehicles with a section that was not protected to leave room for the trip.
The distended inhabitants attacked the municipality of Solihala, saying that it was “incapacity to solve the problem”.
An anonymous local resident said, "They came here this evening after they were driven from Bentley Hit, where they threw stones in the passersby."
Municipality should be pressed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Roma were here in May, they were driven away, and they came back again.
More Roma have arrived last night, and today perhaps even more.
"Municipalate Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Stratsbrook, and I don't like the fact that I'm continuing to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even end it."
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsy leave the previous time, and please, this attack is going on."
This time they became more and we even saw the horse falling on the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solihala said: “We know of the illegal camp on the ground near Stratsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihil police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour on the phone to the police.
This makes it possible to understand the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
The Crimea is operating the champagne wine plant The New World.
The Group of the Republic of Crimea has decided that the “New World” should be adapted to the “New World” at the AOO for the “New World” vs. Crimea,” followed by an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Crimea Anuhuina.
100 per cent of the company's shares will remain in the Crimea State.
The equity equity equity capital will be $595.5 million and will consist of 5.955 million customary shares at a nominal value of 100 rou.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that unless funds are found for the upgrading of the plant over the next three years, there will be a threat of halting the plant.
The contribution of the principal to the enterprise is about 60 to 70 per cent.
The modernization of an enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles. Because of its institutional and legal nature, it is required to devote 50% of its revenue to the budget.
What remains is insufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"It's difficult to get money from the owner, to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations," said Mr. Frema Sergey Patelin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament has incorporated an enterprise into a 2017 privatization plan.
It was suggested that it should be shared and traded.
Interfax's source in Crimea authorities estimated the possible cost of selling an enterprise to 40 million, investor investments in modernization - an additional $30 million.
The “New World” in 2016 increased the production of needle wine by 2.8 per cent, compared with the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golitsin as a factory for the production of a spark wine in the name of the New World that he acquired.
The plant is 11 acres [11 ha] of land.
The following third graders have destroyed more than 40 gravestones
The staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the area below established the identity of the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Laskono.
The third - grade disciples were malicious.
The first statement that the gravest plates were damaged by unknowns was made to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on 27 June.
In all, 24 people were sent to the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Cessation, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police had identified the suspects, and they had two students aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments falling down, and that prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is increasing the tone vis-à-vis the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to tell whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minnit, in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Sattap.
Warning was made the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettt on suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked all year, has refused to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
“The salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority for us, so we are very sorry we cannot continue to work in the area of search and rescue now,” says the organization's statement in the social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges put forward now only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following a ship named Juggend Rett since October.
His crew were suspected of having carried a lifeboat on board migrants whom human traffickers had sent directly to them, and of allowing smugglers to leave with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have taken up only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, so the prosecution records, which were published in the Italian media.
Equipat is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in the zone, rather than humanitarian routings, than for any other reason.
The code of conduct implies, primarily, that the justice courts will be equipped with an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three out of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code “Stay Children”, the Maltese MOSA and Pro-Activa Pro-Activa Disstrictions from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they would not result in any “significant change or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Mining said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans to continue negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently increased their policy in the Libyan direction, and visits to Moscow have been slowed by delegations from opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on the Internal Settlement of the MID of the Russian Federation and the Gosdumaté, Assistant Head of the Republic of Chechnya, Leu Yongv, described the goals of Moscow in this region and of whom the stake is made.
The Libyan contact group you're chairing is almost unknown.
Here, let's say, a contact group on Ukraine, everybody knows about it.
And here's the curtain of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the FIED and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Mikhail Bogdanov's Foreign Minister and Adam Delimhanov (Duma's deputation from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan side by the Speaker of Gosuma Vávicław Várávezin.
At the point of setting up the group was the detention of 11 people on board in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanic Chebathev (September 2015, on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, the Gosumatian representatives, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramsan Kadyrov.
How did you manage to lead her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to chair the group.
Our work was not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanica.
We were able to reach out to all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and Tripoli (which is based on the UN-recognized Government, led by Faiz Saraj. - “Kill”), and Tobruk (a parliamentary residence that opposes the Government and supports the March of Khalif Haftar, which controls eastern Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Premier-Prime of Libya-Ool), we were able to quickly agree to release Russian sailors.
It was then agreed that a contact group should be established to make better use of those contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, and we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya?
There are now five persons in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in power structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to introduce into the Team of Specialists on the Region, the representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of Iran.
There is no permanent need for us to stay in Libya from our staff.
Whether there are Russian military advisers in Libya right now, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All conversations and publications on this matter do not correspond to the truth.
But your contact group includes former military men...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed to a certain point for us as the city of Misurata (where militia units are based), played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi in 2011 and markedly intensified in the years to come.
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, they told us that the Islamists, the terrorists, were all at war.
But it was important for us to assess the situation ourselves, to examine the real military potential that is responsible for why such rumors are being heard, what is the role of Islamists there.
In Misurat, we met with all members of the authorities who were engaged in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken from the militants of the Islamic State, which had been banned in Russia, “Obby”).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they were the ones that played a crucial role in the destruction of IGs in Libya, and not in Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to themselves.
And to what conclusion did you come?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar's been operating on another front, Bengazi.
And IG in Sirte fought the structures that were subordinate to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who had done this anti-terrorism operation to Russia.
And they came, the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, in Duma, MID and Rosgwardi.
You have come to realize that you are in all Libyan regions and that you are likely to feel the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreement, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, again, as it has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to a further meeting was a good signal to us, not too long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
Many write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many of whom believe.
We were faced with this situation when we were in Misura, and Haftar was on his way to the Russian airship, the Admiral Kuznets.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
They said, "You must be very courageous people who have come to us today."
But our challenge is just to show that we do not support only the Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level make it easier to learn twice from the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he learned certainly makes dialogue with him easier.
And there's more to between.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak Russian beautifully.
And pulling to Russia, to some degree, you're experiencing nostalgia on it.
Do you think that Libya's arms embargo could be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the delivery of Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict and we would not want to arm one another at the expense of others.
We would like to see everyone in approximately equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow improve its withdrawal.
The constitution-making process is now progressing actively in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach a compromise solution and achieve an internal consensus.
The election must then take place, which was also referred to at the Saraja and Haftar meeting.
If elections are held and the legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has such a status), then the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, and this will only lead to an escalation of conflict.
During the day, the media reported that Italy, which faced the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their ties with the Libyans?
How, for example, is it realistic that the Haftar authorities will control the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers sending immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need support from Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with Haftar and Saraj and Misurat and the south.
In that regard, the tribes in southern Libya played a major role, and they were ready to cooperate with Russia.
It is a question of preventing the flow of migrants into distant areas of concern to the south?
I mean, literally, they're turning back the buses where Nigerian migrants are going?
That's what we're trying to do.
But that's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows on track.
It is our hope that we will be able to join the south in the process of negotiations between Sarajam, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist in favour of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to building a relationship with Russia or the West?
I'll give my own opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he is of the view that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by countries that do not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is the legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in getting us out of there.
And we mixed all the cards together and started talking to Tripoli, and Tobruk.
And we are reaping the results of this work: Rosnephti concluded an agreement on cooperation with the Libyan State Oil Company - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Head Rosnephti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Resnephite took place.
What will Russia do to her?
I think I'm resold.
And what economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In plans to re-write the contracts concluded at Muammar al-Qadhafi.
These include previous transport agreements (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And what do the Libyans have to pay for?
Well, they've got oil.
So it's a "oil-for-service" scheme, as in the case of Iran?
I don't know what a scheme there is, I'm not really dealing with these questions.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not important.
We're essentially engaged in peacekeeping there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and driving terrorists out of it.
Do you have any records of the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Committee for Security, who said that to date no Russian-Russian member or other countries of the former USSR has been there.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of members of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya.
And from which States, then, are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into that details.
Then we'll have a different question.
How many Islamic fighters in Libya are the Libyans?
There are practically no Libyans, not more than 5%.
The rest are lucky.
Could Moscow negotiate in-house Paris for example?
There are plans like this.
We are engaged in intensive negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have expressed their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations be held?
It's hard to say.
There should be several visits, and then hopefully there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, gardeners collected money on a expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old Sasha Maczol, who has DCP, a hydrocephalian brain and a complete blindness, will receive a special escape route on 5 August.
A useful presentation is introduced by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosareva and the director of the Museum, Constantine Bobkov.
The trainee's money was collected during the charity marathon, “Don't stand up to do good,” which went to Melchiv on 15 July on Chekhov's Day of Memory.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, they got Sasha, who lives in the village of Manukino Chekhovo, and he wrote, "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get on a gift of a runway so my legs will become strong, and I'd learn a little bit to walk."
Sashin's dream has come true!
After being served in the museum, there will be "Concept Postceptrum", a well-known Piastist, well-deserved artisan Alexander Gindin of Russia, who will take the panoramas of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melkhov was played by the curor of the Renaissance David Desert, the bells of the Ilya Drosdachin workshop, students of the P. I. Cekov and the Russian Academy of Gensinski, the artists of the Chekhovian studio.
There were auctions for visitors, a book fair and a charitable sale of gift products with a marathon logo.
On 15 July, the Misichovo West Museum took the initiative to make Chekhov Memorial Day the only day of charity in all the Podmuzka Museum.
A 30-year-old resident in the Zhitomir region, near the local football stadium, shot several times against the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was exposed to noise, reported to FACTAAM in the Gitomir Police Communications Division.
The man then entered a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict in which a man used rubber bullets to shoot a man, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim is given the necessary medical care, and there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooting had escaped.
The law enforcement officials identified his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He has a rubber bullet shooting device removed and sent to an examination.
On this point, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (Holiganism) of the Ukrainian Criminal Code.
The detainee would be in danger of imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev, on 28 July, a shooting attack took place in Lukjanovk, in the area of Tatar Street.
Michel Carter's sentence for reports that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
Massachusetts's woman was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for using text messages and telephone calls to encourage her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will be required to serve 15 months of his term behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of having killed Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the Thursday hearings, "My family is killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She was facing a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and marble blouses, listened to the sentence by standing, burning his hands, and giving up his eyes.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor's court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But counsel Carter said it was a "traggic case that she deeply regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a marked effect on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out the statements made by Roy Linn Roy's mother, saying, "It's not one day that I would not weep for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I manage -- I try to support his sisters, despite the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that she was constantly pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"A person who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law providing for the responsibility of counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with carbon dioxide poisoning symptoms, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been pushed into suicide by Carter.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, kick yourself with a knife, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in several messages that were sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
Just a few minutes before she was suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just need to turn on the ignition, and you're going to be free and happy."
Judge Monice said Carter wanted attention with Roy's death, and prevented her from associating with the press to prevent her from getting the desired.
The opinions of lawyers on this were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Nox published his particular opinion at Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugeny Godchev, "I've let Langford go like a tall fly."
One of the best basketballists in the Single League of the WTB, a 33-year-old Catt Langford, left the UNIS.
The American defender of the “Investigation” commented on President Eugenius Bogchev.
Kit made this decision on family circumstances, told Eugeny Bogchev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UPC and showed a high score in each match, 100 per cent.
That's why I let him go like a high flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him a successful family life and a game career.
Kit Langford played the Kazan Club for three years, winning the Single League silver 2015/16.
During the 2016/17 season, he was awarded the most effective player in the Euroliga season.
He won 21.75 points on average for a match.
This result has been the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of Euroliga, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Schenchheng, informing Europe.
An American is expected to enter into a $2 million two-year contract.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroligi star after July to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Jannis Bouruss had moved to China's CBA.
A sun-lit tourist from Poscova was evacuated by a helicopter in Adiga
Today, the Adihei rescuers evacuated from the mountainous region of the Republic a backup tourist with the greatest sunburn.
The man was resting in the Fish House at a height of 16,000 metres.
The 27-year-old tourist was under pressure, and breathing was difficult.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The leader of the group came to the rescuers and told them that he had been burned by a man.
Audios are to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW stated that it would be proposed to update the software in over 350,000 vehicles.
The President, BMW, stated that the company considered that “there were more intelligent ways than the limitations on entry”, referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW - which considered the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler stated on Thursday that he modifies three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a withdrawal.
European auto-producers have actively advanced the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides, which release diesel engines, are considered concertos and can cause asthma.
The cost to auto-producing equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust gas is also increasing and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German auto-producers are under close attention, the chancellor’s government, Angela Merkel, has also been accused of following powerful motorists and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the error of Volkswagen, which has hidden the use of so-called “measurement” that during testing, they can adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and are excluded under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former director of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zakqueo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore is not immune and may be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation with Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to bypass European emission regulations and expanded the investigation that had previously been concentrated on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the producer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately high income for Volkswagen.
In Astrohana, the kafa traveler paid off false money
A bank office officer was reported to the police to find 5,000 roubles of money transferred from the hospital.
A study carried out at the Expert-Criminal Centre showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrahan region, a bank account was paid by one of the coffee visitors who bought the closet.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with an instrument to determine the authenticity of the merchant.
At present, police officers are identified to be involved in the manufacture and sale of a well-known counterfeit CF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the Astrahan region to be sensitive to financial transactions; it is recommended that traders establish instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "Adian" planet on which even iron can float
For the first time, after studying the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts pointed out that water molecules are so hot with light that they release infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has sealed down water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the earth's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121 (b) refers to the so-called hot yuctres - gas giants, sizes and masses comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but situated ten times closer to the parent star.
As a result, only 1.3 “earth” days are spent on exoplanet this year, and its gas shell is up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C.].
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provans and South France, but there are fears that it is in danger of climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and insect - borne disease, causing the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Scheez, an expert from the agricultural research institute in Provenza, said: “Lavanda in Provans is really at risk because in recent years it has felt the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn, the rains have been much smaller.
This affects the life expectancy of the lavender.
And there are also little cicadas that jump down the leaves of insects carrying microbacteres, and there's a lot of them going up in the very dry weather."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda is not only attracted to vacationers; lavender oil is used in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shees says, "We have very small, undeveloped, weakened, or absent from us, instead of a very long ball of large numbers of flowers.
So we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The decisions that are under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as leaching of mud and water-protected plants and disposing of varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador Winter Universals-2019 met with Ukrainian students
The world's two-fold hockey champion, Ambassador Winter Universal-2019 Alexander Simeon met on the eve of the hokkelists and distributed autographs to the sick.
The meeting was held at the 3rd Winter University-2019 during the thematic week devoted to the chess hockey.
Any shuttle visitor could walk on horsebacks in an artificial iced area.
In addition, estaphetas, Victorians, and games were organized to play with the gift products of the student games, as opposed to the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty school students attended the event.
Alexander Simeon advised the boys to do as much work at sports sites as possible and emphasized that the most important initial step was to work hard and to have a great desire to engage in hockey.
"It's sad that there's a site in Krasnolarsk like the Winter World-2019, where athletes are able to ask directly questions to team coachers," is the championship.
Note that the Ambassadors of the Winter University of Germany-2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles.
The University Shater will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the press service to the Winter Universals.
Medvedev’s words were commented on in Gosdepe
The official representative of the U.S. State Department, Hiser Nauert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dimit Medvedev, stated that there was a need to find “opportunities for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found in order to “improvise bilateral interaction”.
Nauert cited Syria's armistice agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia must be able to work with each other," said a diplomat.
Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, she has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the Hosdep.
Formerly, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of Government of the Russian Federation Medvedev stated that Washington had declared a full commercial war in Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be imposed for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister considers the United States clean play platform to be Trump.
The missing bodbilder in Poscow found a foreign tribute lost in memory
Boybider Shamil Hanmetov was missing on the road in Noginsk on 25 July under very peak conditions: he left the cabin of a car to go to the bathroom.
For seven days he was found unsuccessfully looking for the familiar and the natives.
And Shamil was on a foreign gift in Ramensky.
He was completely naked and found master in his bathroom.
The Danish athlete was unable to explain what happened to him here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was gone.
The identity was helped by the announcement of his missing identity.
On the phone, medical doctors recorded partial memory loss and brain injury from Hanmetov, reports Mash.
There are other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The perpetrators of Shamil’s kidnapping were probably already in his apartment, and his keys were stolen from him.
July's oil revenues exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenues earned as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reported by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The overstatement, as explained by the agency, was mainly by a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to rouble compared with the average monthly value of June used for the evaluation, as well as the actual volume of gas production and the level of export of petroleum products at projected levels.
“The deviation of federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimates in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 in the amount of +40.2 billion roubles.”
The total amount of foreign exchange flows to the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is therefore 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, foreign exchange purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles per day.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currencies by Minphine of Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will make purchases of foreign exchange on the arranged trade in the Moscow Exchange evenly during the commercial day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to Federal Treasury accounts in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist stresses that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Staff members from the weekly Riodos newspaper usually meet in Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight the latest violent crimes in Sinoloa State, related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office that had already been thrown into the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - evidence is not necessary, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in the Government or of cartels, a whole list of teenagers who have become dangerous in Mexico's chaos education work.
Violence is no longer common, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses in the country: according to the Journalists Protection Committee, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nyeto took office in December 2012; 589 people were under federal protection after the attacks and threats; and at least seven people had died in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, the founder of Radiodos, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The great mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is widespread, with a large photograph of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters over the years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have T-shirts that depict his smile, face in points, or branded man.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, their sleepless and paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalism cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Journalists ' Protection Committee.
As with most of the thousands of killings each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Journalists Riodos insist that they'll write about violence in Sinolo, although they're killed by grief, even though it's much more dangerous now.
Without information about killers, there was little use in talking about security at meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdés left the Riodos office in the capital city of Kuliakana.
He was able to travel only a couple of blocks before his red Toyoto Corll was stopped by two men, taken out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Fifty River."
The shotman drove away on his car and hit her nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Hearings usually break through Kuliakana quickly.
But there's almost every silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinola has become one of the bloodiest battles in the country, as rival factions have fought to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that every day in the streets of Siloa one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with two-strated masons of drugs, more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "satisfaction" is just one of the cartels taking control of the maritime state with important ports and roads leading up to the United States.
Despite this, Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohrkes, the 60-year-old co-founder and the director of Riodos, was overwhelmed by a sense of guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder's been helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel faction that is fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication could have become angry with sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not make Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been captured who had written about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as an ordinary milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Nooreste, and in 2003, he sold his 50-dollar shares together with five colleagues.
In Sinloa, “it was impossible to be a journalist without affecting the drug issue,” said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publications, sales, and advertising.
The journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but readers were attracted that they could read about something no longer dared to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Radiodose received a prestigious award from Maria Murs Cabo for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for Boldness in investigating the Mexican drug trade wherever it goes.
He frankly admitted he was scared.
"I want to go on," he said at the PPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Siniloa was “this way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Romanviento TV.
"You have to do things that fall on you, whether you're a journalist or you're a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what's going on?"
Riodos' employees miss Valdez, a joke who ran like a truck in the port, a friend, generous in arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to get into the living.
They relied on his order.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Did he lose love of one order?
His death caused them to doubt in their calculations how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like you going to their wives, children, their legal business and underground airports for the carriage of drugs.
"These things were behind the hell," said Bohorkes.
The result, even at best, was a high level of self - censorship and self - preservation.
We should trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Andrés Villareal, editor of Radiodos, is that "the notion can be deceived... and then what happens is what happened to Habier."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer apply in Sinloa - like in Tamaulipas, Veratrices, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling roads, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The Landshaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodosa staff met for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cellular telephones: a few days before it was known that spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
The two police officers are hidden in the shade of a tree of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to protect the Riodosé office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Kuliakana.
Some journalists asked whether these policemen were not part of the 50 per cent order office, of which the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under the de facto control of drug gangs.
In the nearest issue, Radiodos relied on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinilo's brother of a former champion at Julio Cezar Chavez's side.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the governor’s home city.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kulican, a quarter of the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or how it had happened, so we had to be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling institution-revolutionary party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the last century.
Recently, a number of governors against PRI have been accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when his son, Al Chapo, Guzman, slipped from military raids.
A few months ago, readers would look for Valdez's column with the most reliable information on abduction.
"We would have known before what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic expression, El Flacco.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and skirmishers protesting journalists' assassinations because the staff have become what they never thought they would become: activists who speak on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went to the next morning to a local prosecutor ' s office demonstration dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adams disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west three days after Waldense was killed.
We found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was him on the basis of DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, to protest and to write SOS Press on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohrquez was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinoloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused them of spying for journalists and ordering their murder for what they were telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give more to the Government ' s coverage, fearing that anger would harm its objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico have been “involved” by organized crime, their accomplices in government, and a indifference society.
In his last book, the National Journalist wrote that reporters are not merely killing drug gangs; they do so on orders from politicians and security forces in contact with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Committee believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were directed by police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you shut up," Ramírez says.
Of course, the killings make people nervous.
Everyone remembers about the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulips.
She found a note on her body allegedly written from the face of cartel Zetas: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphone were lying next to her cut head.
Some publications have chosen to close up, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was murdered in March.
Others continue to hold back as El Maniana from Nuevo Laedero after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, "Diario de Ciudad Juárez" publicly addressed drug cartels with a drafting article on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even a country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and they continue to look at dangers in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to a photographer named Ruben Espinosis, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico, three months after he fled Veratrics.
Those who remain and continue to work balance each day between the risks.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - recognizes that he's scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico hits hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, midnight, when the latest release was ready for press, the publishers of Radiodos sat on a sidewalk next to their office and drank beer when their phones suddenly rang.
A series of gunfires between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 bodies, confirmed.
The war continued to burn, as was promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
They were sitting on the sidewalk, putting news through the mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, I had to reframe the first page.
Not far from here were the sirens, another gunfire in the vicinity.
Bohrkes has seen whether the security police are ready to defend.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sealed under a huge portrait of the late founder of their paper, whose middle finger was put on the suspicion of the whole of Sinloa, his staff, Riodos, continued his business.
"How can you think of being shut up," said Bohorquez, "if the very day Javier was killed, the woman asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used the cod to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though he's terrible.
The researchers reported that the first found remains of an incredible size of the rhino found by the Canadian miner were preserved so well that the experts called it Mono Lisa among the dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of its scholastic skin was red- brown - and to say that it had, in some way, a “dark past”.
A report published in Modern biology described it as “the most well preserved of Tyrophorus in the history of the finds and one of the best copies of dinosaurs in the world”.
It's a fossil -- a newly found copy of a nodosar living in the middle of a small period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well-being has come to the attention of researchers, who call him “really remarkable”.
This herb is the best - preserved fossil in the history of discovery, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millenium Mine Company Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the rock, and he decided to look more closely.
The fossil was shipped to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
The next six years, work was done to detect an animal inside the ground mass depth of 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“The only thing to do is to feel a little bit better, and you can almost believe he's asleep,” said the leading author of Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrelults Museum, where creation is shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
In studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was a herb, even though it was covered with a podium and was reminded of a walking tank that seemed to be exposed to considerable danger from dams.
This powerful threshing dinosaur used a red and white stone to hide from predators, and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would enable him to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting his enemies, experts say that he was hunted down by larger dinosaurs.
This is a 110 million-million-year-old family of the Nodosaurus family that was widely publicized in the press in May and is now in the exhibit in the Royal Tyrelble Pyroontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitchalli in honor of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours in his passionate digging.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the figures and the shape of cherries and palsy plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a widely distributed method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the substance was darker than the lower side.
Although protective colouring is widespread, discovery has become unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is far greater than the size of existing protected animals.
It may be assumed that the dinosaurs were so actively hunting the dam dinosaurs that evolution chose to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern protected animals — such as deer, obsoles, or bronze — are much smaller and are more affordable, indicating that nodosars have had a serious struggle to survive.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful threshing of a dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of Meln’s period were,” said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the thorax of the dinosaur also indicates that its skin was supposed to be red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the continued contents of his digestive tract, to find out that he ate during his last meal.
They think that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he had sunk and backed down the lungs on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was as warm as he was now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to be far deeper into dry land than they are now.
“This nodossadar is truly noted to be completely covered with the remains of the scholastic skin, and at the same time remains fully in three dimensions, while preserving the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did at the time, during the minor season.
We don't have to use the imagination to re-establish it, but it's just a little bit more, and we can almost believe it's asleep."
The mellow period is an era where giant terrors, carnivorous dinosaurs, on two legs, wandered around the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant of the river, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors could have been hunted by a titophone.
These include acrokanosaur, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons long.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mamified.
The site was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum officials, this is the world's best-reserved tyrephorus, together with the skin and the shell, and it's a whole, from the face of the femur to the femur bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic sign was two twenty-day necks from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herding tyrephorus was hard on the fact that Canada was now in the open sea until the icy river had taken it down to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossils of this particular copy have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the purplish strips along the dinosaur’s shell.
As Michael Grench wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of preservation is “a thing like winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The exuberant remains of the skin are still covered with purplish strips that glisten the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is stretched out along his side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count necks on his ass."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to reach Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then of the Odessa region in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documentation confirming his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili reports the Polish edition of Telewizja Republica, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili addressed the commemoration of the Warsaw revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since a politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched on the theme of Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as on Ukraine.
That Ukraine ' s migration service had deprived him of his nationality, an opportunist learned that he was in the United States.
How he managed to carry out a transatlant flight without documents is not yet known.
Previously, the former Governor of the Odez region, Mikhail Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the Ukrainian citizenship questionnaire had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled any questionnaires.
Duration of investigation in the Weinziher and Olkhovic case was extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renov Group, Euguy Olkhovic and Head of Energy, T Plus, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the issue of extending the house arrest of the accused is being considered at the Basman Court.
The representative of the UK, at a meeting, informed of the decision to last extend the period of preliminary investigation.
“The complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to remove and conduct a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations within the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation,” said the investigator.
He added that suspects were regularly bribed by Comy’s leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzheer, Olkhovik, and the former director of the OA, Mikhail Slobno, who led Vampelk on 5 September, transferred bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Comie to maximize the benefits of heating and electricity tariffs, as well as to create a favourable business environment.
Weinzicher and Olkhovik were detained, crammed into Sictivcar and arrested for two months, Slobnomy fled the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the depths of his heart.
Just a day after he arrived in New York on a tour of St. Louis, he was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking for a flashboard tape on the phone.
She bumped into the post of anyone from high school.
It said, "Police has just killed a 18-year-old, and he's still in the middle of the street."
Noticeing that no one else in her tape was able to download this information, it was insolvent, it closed the Facebook and it opened the Twitter.
She had a lot of user posts with @TheePharoah.
Rutherford, from Big St. Louis in real time, saw in the Twitter the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black youth who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown’s lifeless body, which was spread out in the street for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't new to her and her circle.
She put her phone away, and then she went back to the tweet that people were coming to Kenfield drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and shouting people and a man who claimed that he was Brown's father, the stateman, saying, "Police from Ferguson has just killed my unarmed son."
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a scooping dog.
On another video of another policeman, she said, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
"It's a non-standard situation," according to her own memories, then Ferrel said.
"It's not a murder, like the ones we're used to and who can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry, and I cried."
She took her ticket back and left home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father's house and decided that both of them would go to Ferguson for the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next nearly three years was the theme of a new documentary entitled “The Streets?” which will be released on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Fairrell was on his way to Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in flowers and flowers, they remembered a conversation that had been spending countless times before this morning, “for the experience of blacks and their situation”.
She recalls: “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
'I couldn't take her,' Ferry said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She must know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well understood in activism and organizations, but also understand the different levels of experience and position of blacks and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel as though I would give her a bad service if she had given birth from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop was made on South-Florisant-Raud, on the road from a police station that was sort of a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the innocence of Officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrere and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They were collecting packages and helping to distribute them to protestors.
Later, in his mind, Ferrel took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-General Louis, she was President of the Association of Sanitary Students, National Minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
“I didn’t have the experience of an organizer.
It came to pass by itself.”
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Saaba Folayan, one of his fellow countrylors.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrar, “just wanted to document” events.
Ferrel came to the mind with the question, "Do you want to document, or do you try to find a story that you can play on?"
This scepticism has been directed to many people, often white people who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and persistence.
As Folayan recently explained, “We heard that the voices of the people born and raised in Ferguson were out of focus and wanted to do otherwise.”
By that time, Folayan had already joined with her co-consor, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
He was very sympathetic to the Ferrel project and to the six local residents with whom the team of the “The Streets?” had been in contact for years since Brown's assassination.
"This documentary doesn't have anyone talking about us or us, it's us who we're talking to," said Davis.
"It was most important to me, as these people will be represented, because this is how I will present it myself."
Although the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience, in an attempt to show that the movement “this is not about the guardian leader, but how the community unites,” as Folayan said, was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, the “Whose Streets?” shows unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel's life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, mockingly talking about the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do such work and restore the blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement are those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social networks after the murder of Trevonne Martin's black youth in 2012 - attributed themselves to homosexuals.
“Cheers of homosexual women in leading positions support all of this movement,” says Ferrel. “That's because we fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black women have had to carry all of this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this assertion, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by a multitude of homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is no positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who cut down that energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it was on the front track because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, Ferguson no longer has a movie camera, but it remains a difficult racial link between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for the closure of the highway during the demonstration two and a half years.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home simply, "Bardak."
She's still holding up the story that she learned when she went to Ferguson Street full of three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadorian football players disqualified for bites of U.S. players
The Fertballists of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have been given long-term dissension for irreconcilable behaviour.
During the fourth final game of the Golden Ballies of North and Central America’s and Caribbean soccer confederations (CONCAAF), Salvadorans have bitten American players.
The first was the defense counsel Henry Romero.
The El Salvadorian bit the attacker, Josie Altidore, then pinched him into his chest.

Controversy: The artist creates portraits with the help of the Chelsea Manning DNA
At the centre of the hall in Galerei Friedman in New York, people's faces whistle on the wire -- white, black and brown, all of which are inconspicuously similar to each other.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Hiser Dewey-Harborg of carcases and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Lewenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year term for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on the Wikipedia website.
The new exhibition, which was released on 2 August, is called "A Controversy."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics and arts, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama softened the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Using a computer DNA program from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult, visual, manifesto on not only the plasticity of DNA data -- different ways of interpreting them and the insensitivity of these interpretations -- but also a concept of identity.
Manning, born with the name Bradley Edward, but since his teenage years, he has openly claimed to be a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spies Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her pictures were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: the grainy black and white self, where Manning, on the platinum wall of the wig, obviously felt awkward, was sitting at the wheel of the car; that photo was associated with her and associated with her.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his draft of 2012 entitled “Obsirings of Stranges”.
In it, an artist created portraits of unknown people by means of court records of the type of skins and the chewing rods, removing DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an electronic letter from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg on a preliminary presentation of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made from her DNA.
So unusually, an artist and her musa in prison became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of the comic book entitled Sufficient Images, illustrated by Sholi Kanungo, which illustrated how in the future the President would soften Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released in the light proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and powerful that the exhibition opens right now when Donald Trump declares war to the people who reveal secret information in the government and invents new ways to stir up in Twitter the hostility he's called upon to soften.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about this all-timely match, she said that "no matter what happens."
In a statement by the artist on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning on the bottom (with a heart instead of the point of "i" in her name) calls for an end to the "automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other side is its mitochondrinal DNA, a long caterpillar of pencils C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist suggests, Dewey Harborg hoped to show how we all look, in any case, on our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine how much we are, how much genetic data are opened for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video "Low Memory" was also exhibited here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in comics.
On it, Manning appears in the King Kong style over the United States Correctional Casar with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"Why don't you ever lock this up."
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ant on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - like it was shown in comics - but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by masks in the middle of the room, her own genetic simulations, gathered together like a crowd of protestors.
This is also done deliberately, as everyone on exhibition up to a height (5"2, Manning's growth), on which the pencils were drawn.
"I'd rather put them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a lot of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of North-West University and associate at Oxford University looking for police officers for murder
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on Professor Northwest and Professor Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects for having been found killed in the luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook Court Court ' s reports, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for alleged murder without the right to be released on bail from the 40-year-old Windema Latem and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Dyranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell-Dyranlo died after he had been injured in many ways.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says that the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Dyranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and the detectives are now investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latem held the position of associate professor of microbiology and immunology at North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice-President of the University of Relations, reported in a statement by e-mail that Latem was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from joining the Northwest University campaigns.
“It is now a criminal case, which is investigated by authorized persons, and the Northwest University cooperates with an investigation,” said Kabbah.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in a statement by e-mail: “We have spoken to the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative bodies”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to give up.
The chief of liaison of the Chicago police, Anthony Gulhemi, said that he strongly advised suspects to surrender.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” said Gulmelmi.
According to Gulmel, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulmelm, the police called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a secret report about what had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene horrible.
Gulmelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself had occurred on 27 July.
He said the video camera records confirmed that Latem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latem and the victim have been connected”, said Gulmelmi.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued an address to the permanents, stating: “At this point the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of motives, including the possible domestic accident”.
Russian Vice-President Mutko: "We are meeting the requirements of the VADA road map in the near future."
The Russian Vice-President, Vitali Mukoko, said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Prong Agency (RASADA) would be implemented shortly.
“A certain step in meeting the requirements has been completed, RSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests jointly with UKAD (anandioping Agency of Great Britain).
WADA Road Map has been updated accordingly," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for restoration of conformity to the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of RSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, she contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
“All has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and VADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that the Russian andidping structures must publicly recognize the results of the WADA investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLarren, which alleged that the Doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
In this regard, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit what we didn't have."
The words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission must be repeated.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication “Rsport” Smirnov acknowledged the earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without reservation," said Smirnov.
VADA suspended RSADA from doing pre-ping control in November 2015 after a pre-stop scandal.
However, in June this year it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of WADA, Olivier Niggly, stated that RASADA was “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
79-strate firefight in Dubai
The great fire that took place in one of the world's highest residential buildings, the Tower of The Torch, the dead, is passing on to Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters managed all fires by 4:00 local time (3.00 mz).
Local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
During the cracking fire, the streets adjacent to the sky were closed.
The reasons for what has happened so far are unknown.
It has previously been reported that Dubai has a 79-strated residential skyscraper The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unsolicited knockout of fans: pants that don't cover the rabbits
Olga Buzova, a Nordic realist, struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live Dancing Festival in their rabbits.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly introduced singer with Nastas Kuudre did the song "We'll Be Hot."
Both girls went to the stage in provocative bunnies, squeezed in such a way that the underclothes of the singers looked like.
Buzova and Kudry were inscribed on the trousers.
Previously it was reported that changes in the appearance of Busovov commented on a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Tabletenberg recognized the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service referred to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia could, and that further escalation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at dangerously low levels and accused the United States Congress of doing so.
The Metro Ekaterinburg is refreshing a new way of paying
In October, travel to the Ekaterinburg Metro would be able to pay for the bank card, and the director of the I-Sset, Pavel Vedernis, told the OA in an interview with the White Paper.
Our goal is to introduce a system of subway travel to the 2018 World Cup as well as to other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want sick people from other countries, visitors to uniforms, to use a metropolitan with their bank cards, not acquiring new protons or standing in line”, he said.
The startups who will help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among staff members of his e-commerce startup, but no interviews were conducted.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, indiscreet.
And even though she promised anonymousness, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective”, said Errettt, a company run by a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, engaged in electronic commerce in the area of hair care.
She therefore turned to others for help.
A new type of start-up in the area of personnel is now being created to help companies find out how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, whose purpose is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to do express inquiries, to consult certain teams and demographic groups, to offer an anonymous and hot line for complaints to staff, and in some cases to enable the informers to pass the top management and direct to the derequiry.
“Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and President of the Global Starter of Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure the involvement of staff.
Errett said that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of the use of Glint.
In addition to the express and command interviews, the product offers the company's heat map and shows in visual form where more complaints are made and where managers have a low rating of approval, which allows them to understand why.
Companies realize that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they become another Uber, who became involved in a scandal, when a former staff member published a post on a blog describing the aggressive environment in which those who expressed grievances were punished.
For startups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation -- an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal “Let us talk about pay,” dedicated financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and conformity industry can cost over $111.7 billion by 2020.
The Corvercent Star of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the fall of the image of Ubera.
"Convercent" has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Mayrosoft and Tasla.
A Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like "Glint", "Convercent" allows companies to send individualized interviews, collect confidential real-time responses and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the resolution.
“The Court of Public Opinion took over the powers of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president, “Convercent”.
If it finds that the company does not treat the staff or behaves unfairly, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly effects of boycotts by clients, outflows of staff and legal actions, reports Quinlan.
Ruby Tensday, a network of restaurants where 500 establishments employ more than 25,000 staff, has been using "Convercent" for over a year to make sure that the staff members are aware of the rules and procedures and to suggest a simple way to go to the company's main office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a Mail of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, says James Witrano, Head of Legal Affairs, Ruby Today, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that a company uses the "Convercent" service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, chaos and unfair pay – can be found and addressed more quickly.
“I can draw close to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation”, said Vitrano, who is leading the risk management team of the Ruby Today network.
“And we protect our shareholders from trials with employees”.
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously into account the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the accounting firm Artur Andersen failed because of ethical irregularities resulting from Della Enron.
But only when the “social networks were spread out” did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry from getting viral on the network.
“Wherever people used technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy”, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging regular fees for use with companies.
This is a business model and an opportunity that was welcomed by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, "Convercent" received $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tala Capital, which resulted in the total capital of the company totalling $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Vency Parts, bringing the total capital of the company to $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing amount of research has shown that staff members today expect more of their jobs than they used to.
In hard competition markets, such as the Silcon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
The staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, feel they're being heard, and that the work they do results, they're more likely to make such a company successful,” says Nina McKuin, Vice-President for Global Benefits and the satisfaction of the staff members in LinkedIn, where both "Convercent" and "Glint" are used.
Investors get income when companies from their portfolio go well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it may give the impression that change will come.
And if change does not come fast enough, or if change does not happen, there may be frustration, and staff members will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you're going to be ready to have 4,000 interviews," says Russell Rat, president of the Corter International Management Advisory Office, who had to see companies make a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
“Why, if you don’t go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘ Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem through Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from staff members who were upset about the decision-making speed and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams inside the company and introduce a communications training exercise to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to retain its staff more effectively in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
If you're losing people, you're losing customers.
And if you lose customers, you're losing company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened on the Redoarmeaya Avenue.
In Barnaul, fundamental measures were taken to address the causes of the asphalt failures on the Krasnoarmeaya Avenue.
The place where the pits were created twice on the newly embalmed carriageway (traveling the streets of Youth), it was decided to “open up”.
Recall that a small part of the road near the tramway was broken because the land in the area of an unexploited unexploited network was inhabited.
A detailed survey would be carried out for detailed survey and destruction of the prerequisites, according to the vice-chairman of the city ' s road safety, improvement, transport and communications committee Ivan Garmata.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the recovery and concrete of the debris will be required.
This is reported on the official site of the country capital.
Commander Bruins has to do longer work because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
Time is approaching 11 p.m.; a football team from the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to get on one side of the new training fields of teams on the track.
Some of them dragged their T-shirts, hugged their backs brilliantly from the sweat after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many players, teams have been doing this idle break in the middle of the day.
After three hours of training, players will go back to the dormitories to prepare for final examinations and return to Wasserman’s football centre next morning to meet at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned to Tuesday, Bruins Jim Morea, coach, said, "These guys are waiting for a meatcut in the next three days."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the load for players, in fact extended their working hours — at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the first three training sessions at the University of California, Los Angeles, were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already hot schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings per day has increased the number of days with one training, and Breins is moving the camp for almost a week compared with the previous year, and is conducting training during summer school for the first time in six Sea seasons in the West.
It is estimated that they will have 18 training sessions to be conducted until 20 August, before starting formal preparations for the first season game against team A&M at Texas University in September.
Mora said that she supported a change in rules by the National Student Sports Association, even though it had created another point in the players' busy schedule.
"In three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious trial," said Mora.
"And they've just overcome it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we survive until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is a difficult task, as its fields are directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighbouring Lasquin Center, a expensive hotel, which has already been bombed by football balls that have crossed the security network outside the gate.
Bruins players have to keep hotels from this weekend, but Mora assumes that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have protection," said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of anyone taking a room, sitting there and recording the training on the video.
If you have a video record of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security at parking number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
All those affected by the terrorist attack in Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All those affected during the attack in St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service by Governor Anna Mintina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in the prisons, and the TV Centre is transmitting.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metropolitan was in progress on 3 April this year.
A suicide bomber, Akbarjón Jaliv, blew the bomb.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abroar Azimov, were arrested.
We recall that on the eve of his earlier experience, he recommended that the Petersburg Metropolitan to review the plan of transport security activities, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is increasing fact-finding in the fight against fairy-news
Facebook will more frequently send out texts suspicious of the miscalculations, independent experts, and show their findings under original posts, declared on Thursday the largest social network of the world that is trying to combat so-called fairy news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use advanced machine learning algorithms to recognize possible capabilities, send them to check and possibly show the results of the fact-finding under the entry post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy news that many believe has influenced the United States presidential election of 2016.
This issue is also being discussed actively in Europe after the French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and Germany, in front of the September elections, expressed support for a plan to fine social networks, unless they quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook announced a test of a new fact-tackling algorithm launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context in order to reach reasonable conclusions about what they are reading and sharing”, wrote Facebook tape manager at Sarah Sue's box.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of the “linked articles” and work on other changes in the news tape to address the problem of flash news.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video Squezee, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it served as a shelter for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his comfortable place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a rough story around him, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a horkshire with a copier hair and a propensity for historical documents, a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with inspiration.
"You feel it in person when you keep this letter in your hand."
The English Castle covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evaryan era and tells of families living in Scotty; each story illustrated one of the young British artists, Isaac Lencevic, Brian May Smith, William Equili, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote "The Dead Man and Other History" -- a compilation of British Library documents -- and this project suddenly touched it to the depth of his soul.
"I could just print my finger on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the anchors," he says.
"This is a fingerprint of his finger."
And the letters always smell like smoke because fire lit at that time for lighting.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how much I love archives!"
For a person covered by this passion for old paper, it seems too good to be true for the National Fund and the English Arts Council to live in the castle for four months.
Rhodes studied Victorian Castle all day, walked through the archives, and considered the numerous treasures of names and old things -- such as the heads of hyena on walls or bottles of centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, spoke to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then, at night, he said, "He drank a whisky and sat down to write."
Scotney's castle history is not very clear, because the National Fund has only been fully accessible in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just starting to deal with an archive that he described as "the fact that the aristocratics had fallen to the attic for centuries."
The days, the letters of the British Empire, the cards showing who owned what they said, "You think land disputes are boring,' says Rhodes, but there are two families fighting for it.
That's how it happens, guys!"
In some stories, the castle is becoming a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in "The Workbook," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Cretan Revolution of 1381.
“There is evidence of the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called Kent and Sassex Royal Families,” says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt began in these places, and I thought rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were bound?"
Other stories are closely related to the story of the castle, such as “The Priest”, which tells of a priest whose family, Darrell, had been hiding during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or "Contbandist" about the 18th century smugglers Arthur Darrela, who is believed to have staged his own funerals, stoned the tomb (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrells, the beloved Rhodes family of all Scotneys, "Jentlmen seem to have been perfected, got into debt forever, and spent money on something they couldn't afford.
In a number of generations, male Darrells have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women, and I imagine them as a company of sympathetic guys who are capable of caring for the heirs of a large fortune."
Following the end of work in Castle Rhodes, other possibilities for unique written experience are sought.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish gloss, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyamaki, a place where the sanatorium was at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew back into the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this, damn it, I have to get back to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose "Russia"
The conflict with the Russian Banks Association (ARB) is developing: following the Suberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Roselchsk, Binbank and FK Open, and seven other credit organizations are going to leave the public organization.
Therefore, organizations that have left the ARB will have at least 80 per cent of the market.
But it's not just an exit -- all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another community organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Axkov, the Chairman of the Financial Markets Committee, who is recognized, by the last session, and the most effective head of the thinkinal committee and a member, by the number of drafts that have been prepared.
The intra-ARB conflict was initiated during a discussion in the Council of the Federation, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, including new classification of banks according to the size of statutory capital.
At that time, Garegine Tosunian, President of the ARB, said that the bill was adopted for the largest banks, who were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clientele.
Other claims were criticized by the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, was not always justified in withdrawing licences from some banks, which were actually the subject of opposition by the representative of the CB: many leaders of trans-shipment banks, in particular, were part of the ARB governing bodies.
This exchange of mutually exclusive views seems to have begun in a highly sensitive relationship with the main bank manager and has become a visible excuse that the 15 largest banks, in opposition to the ARB policy, have begun to prepare for the accession of the “Russia” association, noting that “the efficiency of the RAB's work is low and that there is virtually no constructive dialogue within the banking community”.
The investors will be better.
What's going to end up?
Let us answer directly to the main question that arises in the smallest disruption or conflict in the banking sector or in the vicinity of the banking sector: the credibility of the banking system is more likely to increase.
She is headed by Anatoly Axakkov, known for their sympathy in all matters relating to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all CB leaders are present at annual activities of the association, and all relevant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through regional expert assessments.
In the human-organizational sense, there are also no special shocks.
There is no doubt that the ARB is falling into a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants have lost their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest, established in 1991, has considerable potential for banking and monetary services in general.
It is not possible to say that the Russian Association, with its extended embraces, is prepared to accept, on any terms, new members, judging from the response of its leader, Anatolia Akskova (“maybe too much) who, on 21 July, at a briefing in the parliamentary newspaper press centre, said that “the next day the representatives of the banks leaving ARB asked me to consider increasing the potential of our Association Russia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the bank voice of the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, proposals from both parties are being examined, an agenda for an extraordinary exit of an association is being prepared, which will take place in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum.
We'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Axakkov, stressing that “the chair is not holding back,” referred to the possible new leader of the updated Association “Russia” George Luntowski, who leaves in September as Vice-President of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakkov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend one day of leave and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the extraordinary convention of Russia.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The Deputy Head of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia had not yet been restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our vision is to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there, the concept is to move immediately to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for it.
The question is, what year has it been?
It's the same at the level of slogans of the phrase -- let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know if this may happen," brings "Prime" to the words of the Minister.
Previously, the newspaper “Investigation” reported that by 17 August, the Vice-Premier, Anatomy Dvorković, was mandated to examine proposals for possible options for electric cables submitted to the Government by PACAS Gentor Sergey Koggini.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars from DAF in major cities and resorts.
Washington, D.C., mollusk.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving the grinkart.
The plan aims to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save the taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing how the United States issues the parking cards to nationals of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace current patterns.
The new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates and have the money resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and that should be our concern.
We haven't thought 2017 could no longer get worse, had a new report on technological successes in sex work.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now the focus.
The Responsible Worker Foundation (FRA) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Shaki, a well-deserved professor of robot and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffild and co-founder of the FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users can choose the color of the robot eye, the shape of the juice, and the type of fingernail.
"People are snorkeling about it, but firms are sending them to consumers on a large scale, and we'll soon see them much more," said Charki at the presentation of a new report.
Modern sex-cocks have evolved from their superpowered robot gatherers with a silcon skin warm and almost human raps run by artificial intelligence.
Users may also “feel” their robots in their own taste, choosing everything from eye colour and the shape of the nipple work to the shape and colour of the fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" that Stepford Women would seem very progressive is a matter of even greater concern.
Modern sex cocks have become silencing robots.
For example, RialBotix trobot enables users to build quality that they find attractive -- for example, complacency.
There's also Roxy Gold's sex robots, developed by the True Company, which are associated with an already programmed individual -- for example, the Cold Farm makes an impression of a shy, and Decia Vandy has a "silence" character.
"The Roxy Gold has a character that's good for yours," says the article, "The Truth Company."
So she loves what you love; she doesn't love what you don't like and so on.
She's having a change of mood for the day, like a real man!
She might want to sleep or talk, or she could be "in the mood."
There is much concern in the appearance of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but more deeply concern the subordinate woman, the rape associations that cause the cold.
On the real Company website, Roxy is compared to the electorate, for men only.
"If a woman has a elector, why can't a man have a Roxy?" said on the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift away from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex and subjugation as an option supplement.
Most men, of course, won't buy sex robots, and while the HRR notes their growing popularity, they're still on the consumer's border.
But what comes to us from the outside may be very edifying about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complicated sex robots have come into existence just when women's rights around the world are threatened when the White House has a president who boasts of what comes to women.
The worst thing about the TV series "The Certificate of Servants" is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the eyes, which is just how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Galad is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The goal of the sex worker industry is to provide physical image to real women (only with the proportion of porn) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like humans to dig the movements of the human body.
But it's your "haracters" robots that don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with or withdraw from their partners.
They don't have their own lives or their biographies -- nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could ruin the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
L.A. Eugene's brother-in-law, Jeter, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team on the Basketball championship of Europe, the final part of which is launched on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, Andrey Swanev, general manager of blue-yungs.
We tried to make arrangements with Jette, but unfortunately, he won't come on family terms.
We're going to Europe without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for our young players to develop," he said.
I recall that with the direct involvement of Jeter, the collecting Ukraine took its sixth seat in Eurobasket-2013 and was first hit by a basketball championship, where a yellow blue was unable to cross the group phase, and a U.S. refugee took on an average of 15.4 points, did 3 hits and gave 5 gears.
Jeter ceased to speak for Ukraine from the time he left our national team chief coach Mike Frantello, who left the post in 2015.
The male Europe-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold a promised group tour on Earth.
The Trustee of Eugenia Murzyn in Group B will have five individuals, with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's assembly conducted two check-ups in which Dutchs and Belarusians went.
A big feat of Trump?
Pictureing Mit Romney is pretty smart.
In the Trump era, the general place was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate had hit some families at the micro level.
Between the Day of thanks and Christmas, American newspapers sang in columns about how to deal with the terrible families voting behind the Trump.
Looks like we're all tense enough to kick up soon.
Less talk about the ability of the Trump to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, left-wing poet from Chicago, who was a long time on knives with Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining in the fight against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trampa in the White House, all she knows, including her estuary brother, whom she argued about the policy of decades, suddenly and oddly on one side.
Over dinner, this is definitely good; but I can't help but think that, in the broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Tramp's inhaled forces in the left flank, but the distorting effect of his control can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization”, we mean the little chance that one day we will no longer be hurt by his outputs.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans who, in the face of his standards, suddenly become a model of common sense.
I realized that I really miss Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-per-cent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax statement looks like) -- compared to Trump and both, it seems like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with our children to the central park, the largesthouse in the New York Park Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass - fiber pictures on the central drum - balling clowns and animals that look terriblely on their backs, are extremely ominous, and the music scene is strange.
So many well - known things in this city are disappointing: species from the skyscrapers get tired, silhouettes of buildings have come too far to stir up the trembling, and the reality of the city is not successful at dreaming.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I found out that the Suissecotage area is not actually a Swiss shuttle.
And the central park was still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a 11-year-old child and two women in 40 years could spend a great time.
If I could make a carousel's assessment, I'd put a five, but fortunately no one asked me to do that.
And in the departmenthouse this week, I was asked to evaluate my "test" buying on a scale of one to five stars before I did a terminal card.
In a coffee shop at the corner of my street, it's still the same plus the option of escorting an estimate of teas by 15%, for ordering them to stay.
As a result, not only is this kind of dialogue slowed down, but it also has to make a personal contribution to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller in the store smiled steadily while I was tired of evaluating my experience in giving her a credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorus was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pythorus leaves prison because he visits a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which he claimed were the result of falling in a cell.
Pythorus was convicted of murder after an appeal from the Public Prosecutor's Office for an initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Stenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the toilet room's door in his home in Pretoria.
Pythorius said that he accepted his friend for a night's thief hidden in his toilet.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General's Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that an appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The NTV journalist suspected of having been beaten was chosen to sign a non-execution certificate
Capital law enforcement officials have chosen to take the form of a signature for a man who has attacked NTV television journalist NEC during live broadcasts from the Gorekov Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TSS with reference to the official representative of the MVF Irina Volk.
“In the context of the criminal investigation of a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code (Pobaby) against a 32-year-old man who struck a correspondent of a television channel in the Central Park for the culture and recreation of the Mountain, a suspect has been selected to take a preventive measure in the form of a sign of non-refoulement and proper behaviour,” he explained.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for police disobedience had been drawn up against the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast, an odd man came to the correspondent's address and hit the face.
As it later turned out, the hooligan has nothing to do with the HDV.
On the contrary, according to the airstripers themselves, the paratroopers tried to delay Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tentacles
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tentacles, as reported by the BBC television channel.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of persons who had placed tents in an unplaced place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still taking place.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel “Bi-Te-Ve” that Bulgarian citizens had subsequently been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camping and have already imposed serious fines for all who are caught while staying in the wrong place.
Checks will be conducted throughout the entire season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The U.S. Vice President of the United States was charged with cold war rhetoric.
The statements made during the European tour of Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by Russian MIJ.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is becoming more deeply involved in the primitive ideologically-based stamped cold war, which is totally disentangled from reality,” states a declaration by the Russian foreign policy department.
Thus, the MID responded to Pens' words about the “Rosian threat” and attempts to break the boundaries imposed on them in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “or with the West, or Russia” and the invisibility of the term of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force for the withdrawal of Kosovo from Serbia and thus creating another hotbed of tension.
“We call upon American colleagues to cease the arrest of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a commitment to joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests”, is stated in the Russian MIJ's statement.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with an accident in Poscow.
The accident occurred in sub-spano, as a result of an inkmark with the "Assistance End" caret suffered by the Feldsher.
Today, at about 08:10 ms., a Mitsubishi car with a ambulance in the town of Stupino Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the speed machine was turned over”, the TSS stated in the press service of the MoU on the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officials are involved and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the province of Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son in the construction of a cellophane.
On the evening of 3 August, the Police Division reported to a local resident that he had found a baby in an underdeveloped private home.
“Furthers and doctors who quickly took the child to a medical facility went to the scene of the incident,” reported the Head of the National Police in Odessa.
The medical authorities found that the boy was born hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the pupae.
Priority operational and investigative activities have identified the identity of a woman, a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been in the field of law enforcement and had not been given special attention.
The police currently determine the circumstances and reasons that have prompted the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The infant is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage dump.
"I'm in battle, although 55 isn't 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian era of Grigroy Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary in the coming Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with an expert called “Gospel.”
I remember your colonel.
The special shuttle in the Lannica, Gloria Genor was a paratrooper, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have pretended to spend your next five years.
Did the designs happen?
In terms of profession, it was a good period.
I worked hard, I went through the whole country three times, giving 120 to 130 concerts a year.
I've released two good albums.
Of course I'm not what we say 20 years ago.
The biological clocks won't lie.
Drinking as much as I've been singing at my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm in battle, and I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm at a different level.
You're recording with them the first album in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're going to lead it to Los Angeles.
It's called "You Are So Serious?" on a single song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere.
We'll do it later, when we'll take a click on it.
And the album is represented in November by a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall."
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand on your new plate.
Do you think you wanted him to be involved in your garage?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the world's most impressive drummers today.
He came to my studio and recorded his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson, a well-known drummer involved in different projects.
But for long - term work in Russia, they put forth lenient conditions, so to speak.
It was about fees ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 a month.
Then I thought I'd find worthy musicians in post-Soviet space.
And I found a great Max Mac Machachev drummer.
It is better to feed your souls.
At times, I want to fight at any of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosuov has been high on the international level.
Western music magazines are writing about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his game, said, "There has been a new generation of guitarists with another executional technique."
The album is your home in Los Angeles, the American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to break that ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've told you I'm studying.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not stupid, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for the past 70 years have not had the goals that American musicians have always faced.
They sought the highest possible quality.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me at the entrance for ten years.
But I'm still going to file for visa at the British Embassy every year to be allowed to go again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe to me is well-deserved.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an officer's concert, right?
Yeah, in Monte Carlo, there's a nice Sports Hall, I've done it before.
Now you've invited me again, and, I know, all the tickets to the concert are already spoiled.
On 20 July, you'll go to Radio Laima Wykule?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a beautiful woman who is capable of giving herself and her beautiful wolf, and even whispering.
After the galleys and the music concerts, as far as I know, you're going to go to the creative work of Vladimir Vistok.
Two albums with his songs on your diskography already.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 Vishtsk songers in about the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No alarm.
Accompanied me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernis.
I'll try to involve Alexander Jacovalvich Rosenbaum in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy person, so let's see how it works.
You and the songs of Boris Grembnerov gradually entered their repertoire.
Maybe you'll write down his stuff later on?
Boris Boris Borisović is a beautiful man and a great musician.
I bumped into him several times and asked him, can I sing a song or something?
He said, "Gorgia, I'm writing songs to do it."
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to write a album like that.
As long as I don't have a task like this, but in the future, a year or two later, if Boris Boris Borisović doesn't object, I might make a project like this.
If you don't concentrate entirely on what you do in your producer center.
I suppose, before you realize his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists that you're interested in?
There are a number of actors I'd like to have under my wing, but they're separate, stand-alone people.
You mean Sergey Lazarus?
Serge's a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's a development strategy.
And at my center now, there's Alexander Panaiotov, who I was driving in Golosa.
We made a contract with him and we work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a genuine regret if he fail to reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, taking off his wings.
I hope so.
I'm also trying to move other artists at my center: buying them songs, weeping poets, sometimes in rotations of television and radio channels.
If they don't reach high heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money they put in.
Although I'd be pleased if any of them were to make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on.
But if that doesn't happen, no one's going to cover oxygen.
Let everyone work, try, prove how I once proved it.
If you're asked to make a hotel tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee you entrance to the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
The main concern is closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I am the man of my country, a Russian, who was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that broke down.
If they say tomorrow we have to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll sing.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has happened to Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry it won't work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
I met you anywhere.
Thank you very much.
And with several Ukrainian artists, they cooperated: Anni Lork, Light Lobodoy, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the masses of gifted people are truly sorry that they cannot now fully extract their talent into a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuka, and make a concert with him.
But I think at this point it's unlikely...
Andreya Ocupova was thrown out of the cosmodrome
As has become known, the technical director of the East Andrey Oplopkov launch a work at the State Space Research and Production Centre (CHPCC) called Khrushniev.
He had previously worked in de facto on the construction of the East Cosmodrome, but owing to disagreements with the leadership of the Land and Space Infrastructure Management Centre (CECI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow ' s Phils, which would take over the coordination of production.
Mr. Opopkov's replacement will not be available: the Technical Director's post is likely to be abolished and the function is scattered within the CECI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Manager of CENIC for Technology Development, Andrei Oplopcov, went to work at the KNPC called Khrushniev, “Holk” told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a government officer.
"He's been working in a new post for a couple of weeks," they said, "Kill's interlocutors in the industry."
CENCI ' s operational comment could not be received on Thursday, and Mr. Opelkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the “Messenger” information was formally confirmed in the HCBSC.
He decided to move to the Director of Production Coordination, stated at the enterprise. Andrey Oplopkov was given the task of providing a minimum start point for the first East launch.
Mr. Oglopkov moved to the CENIC in 2013, with his desk in the space force, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plessec, in the "North" launch of the cosmodrome, served as the first deputy commander of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Oplopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that regional commercials had been sent by him to the State Guards but had failed to meet the obligations undertaken to clean the separated parts of the launch vehicles in the Archangelic Region and the Republic of Comi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technological development responsibilities of the CECI were extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then leading Federal Space Agency, Oleg Stopenko, told me directly that the situation in the East had been critical in October 2013.
The fact is that a strategic error has been made in planning: the completion and launch of the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier was planned for the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the construction had been completed six months earlier and the dates had been resettled from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be a trick: CENCI specialists had begun to build parallel technological equipment at poorly built sites.
Andrey Oplopkov was the chief supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks and the transportation that occurred (in December 2015, the Souze took off only on 28 April 2016), this idea has proved true, says the "Kill" source on the cosmodrome: “Even though we would not have carried out a single run from the East but we would still be building”.
The vice-premier, Dmitriy Rogozin, who was in charge of setting up a cosmodrome, called Andrea Ooplopkov his "space Susan" joke, but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the building.
Remembered Mr. Odlopkov and directly, for example, in an interview, he proposed that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetor) be deprived of the status of the sole executive in East and work directly with the sub-contractors: "Why do we have to put all eggs in one basket of the Special Tools?"
That idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENIC has assumed the functions of the General Contractor to complete construction and construction work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned launch in the fourth quarter.
According to the “Scient,” the reason for Mr. Opopkov's move to a new location was disagreement with the CECI leadership on how to complete the construction of the building and space complexes, as well as working with sub-contracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be better for all,” says one top manager who is involved in the East Reservation.
The government officer, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best specialists, and it's not going to be easy to find an equivalent replacement”.
According to "Planet", this will not be required: the post of Technical Director of Cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions scattered within the CECI units.
In the music schools, there's going to be a two-pronged program.
In the future, children’s music schools will be able to receive two classes at the same time.
According to the director of the Department of Science and Education, the Ministry of Science and Education of Saintsław Goulbenko, it is possible to re-read repeated disciplines to students, and the question of the payment of the rest of the classes in the second degree is being resolved through special grants is transmitted to RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow for the development of two professions, but at the same time will not be in conflict with existing legislation in the field of education”, said Goulbenko.
Last Friday, during the Sunday Talk, Vladimir Putin, with students at the Syrius Children's Center, a student named Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for repeated items at the second CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying in violin and piano class and had awards for both directions.
The Head of State acknowledged her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on a wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russianman, Cyril N., was arrested and entered the roof of a high building on the wall, reports El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
A young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved a three-metre fence to the territory of the Nestle office building and took one of his towers on his own.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance, and ropes.
You've held the young man on the roof.
The officials of the Ministry of Public Security took him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
There they find out if the young man is lawfully in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, video videos with a high - ranking young man became popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a "pac man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products, and chocolate can help to facilitate HRM.
Red meat and chocolate are accepted as nightmares for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests that a diet rich in meat proteins and milk products can help ease symptoms for those suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease, affecting some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leading to cripples and absorption, chronic or blood - bearing, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
In order to mitigate the symptoms, patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University found that the top amino acid protein of the troptofan protein is used to produce immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colon, explained that the immune cells in the intestines were to ensure that harmful germs coming from the food did not enter the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are compared with cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too severe inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The experiments showed that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines are becoming more tolerant of the cells.
And this bacteria needs tryptafan, one of the building blocks of protein, to start off these cells.
Professor Colón said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria -- Latural cross reuteri -- which is part of the normal microbiom of the intestine, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptofan was contained in the food of mice, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same work would be done by people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptofan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less resuscitating environment in the intestine.
Luiz Servantes-Barraganvas, who studied the variety of immune cell tolerances, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line, had no separate ones.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbioms of the mice in bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach and in the gut.
Mice intestinal cells were segregated and six types of bacteria found on mice with immune cells but missing mice without them were found.
Mice grown in a sterilized environment, with no good microbe and no immune cell growth, got L. reuteri, and their immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then moved small portions of the liquid, without bacteria, to the missing immune cells separated from the mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of the tryptophythane, known as the indol 3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptofons in mice food, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the tripofana level was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same higher tolerances of cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach-to-kitle tract.
Whether by-products from L. reuteri contribute to cell development is similar to those of mice, but those with inflammable intestinal intestinal diseases have had defects in genes associated with tryptofan.
She says, "It is possible that the development of these cells must be strengthened, as these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inside of the gut.
High levels of tryptofon, where there are L. reuteri, may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
In the opinion of José Maurinu, Manchester United employed “glorions” in Nemanani Matić
Manchester United hired a “flashion” in Nemananya Matić's face, considering José Maurinu to be the day the para-debulator debuted at the mat against Sampadoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought for £40 million from Chelsea, began with a victory of 2-1 in Dublin at the last UYoud pre-session match before UEFFA's match against the Madrid Real on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereyre burst before they came to their senses.
However, since Matić did not participate in the Chelsea pre-session tour on Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he spent only 45 minutes, which, according to Maurinu, required further processing before the Prime League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is he's thinking about football," said Maurinu.
“We'll help him get ready sooner than late.”
Like Matić, his associate non-profit players Victor Lindellef and Romeo Luka started playing at the Aviv stage when Maurinu began forming its main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but he pointed out that the club had already achieved fantastic results by recruiting three of the four players he would like to recruit first.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
"I'll be glad even more if they get me four out of four, but they're already very good for me."
The former leaders of the Social Democratic Republics of Lithuania have ordered them to remain in the ruling coalition.
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, Ambassadors Algirdas Boutkjavivics and Gediminis Kirquilas, as well as former Speaker of the Sima social-demos social-democracys, Cheslov Jurchenas, appealed to the All-Participants to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the newspaper Parlamentia, due to training with partners - the Union of Farms and Greens - the Social Democratic Party has initiated a discussion as to whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
Three senior colleagues have addressed an open letter to one party, which states, inter alia: “It is understood that the frustration of the party's counterparts, but the coalition with the peasants has made it easy for us to pursue the goals of social justice, which we are taking in the Government's programme, and to maintain the political domination of the left centre over the right parties.”
In the view of the party's former leaders, the debate has so far “remained the emotion of expression without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that the unthinking actions of their party may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Antônio Mamaev disabled
Mosgord softened the punishment of an disabled person, Antony Mamaev, from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, the judgement of the Timirziev Court had released the convicted person from SIZO.
Mosgord confirmed, however, that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized the robbery and abduction of a motorist at the former special forces fighter.
Mosgorud, by his decision, reduced the penalty to £200,000.
“Mamiev is the organizer of a breach, which also forms the crime and therefore must be criminally prosecuted”, explained Mosgorud Ullian Solopov’s press secretary.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mameva, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, which provides that the penalty may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mameva Vasili Cepasta, the Court did not establish the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of gravity of the case and to a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorud’s decision.
I'm disappointed with the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify it, and it was the intention to further fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude appeal against the judgement before the Mosgorud Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the tools up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Recall that the 28-year-old Muscovich Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
He claims to have bought a motorboat from acquaintances for 160,000 roubles to sell it later.
However, motorist owners, of whom former Special Forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Ceopastov, had taken their property away from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Moscow Regional Court sentenced Vasilia Cepótina to three years of confinement, and Antona Mameva to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving a sentence in the general regime (in the hearing of article 2, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZI, the Public Chamber, the Genprocurture, who was the commissioner of human rights at President Tatian Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamiev was released from SIZI by a decision of the same Timirziev Court.
The defence appealed to the first instance in Mosgorud.
UNF will prepare a environmental report to the President
In 2017, the National People's Front (ONF) National Action Forum will focus on environmental issues, reported the "Investigation" source to the UNF, and confirmed Alexei Animov's head of the movement.
He said that, as a result of the forum, there were plans to prepare a report to the President on the problems of national ecology and to propose a strategy to address them.
The FONF interlocutors note that the report of the Head of State will contain a “deep analyst” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the News, the UNF outcome forum will be held in autumn.
The exact date for its implementation has not yet been determined - it is generally based on the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key UNFF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Ross-Dan, Kaliningrad and Kiriv.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Burundi, Ulaan Udé.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward at these events, we will make systematic proposals to address environmental problems, and we have told the “Investigators” of the UNF.
The Co-Chair of the Central Headquarters of the Olga Timofev movement, chairing the State Committee on Environmental and Environmental Protection, reported that “phortics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Environmental Protection in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the “Action Forum” of the UNF is likely to be reciprocal.
Over the year, we grew up with a powerful team of environmental experts, found gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition, Pharmaceuticals are also referred to the work on the priority projects of UNFF, which has been told by Olga Timofev.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State for Environmental, Environmental and Transport, Sergey Ivanov, would be invited to attend.
He had previously participated in the work of the ONF Mediaforum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Environment will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to set up environmental mechanisms to work for long years.
To ensure that those issues did not fall out of the agenda, Olga Timofev added.
The head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising the environmental issue, UNF operates in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President, said Andrey Kolyadin, “Investigations”.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give further impetus to the regions for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able to disprove not only their environmental problems but also the development of eco-tourism, and the expert added.
Environmental relevance demonstrated the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a garbage dump in Balashi (also closed) and coal dust at the port of Najjyka (the draft law on the prohibition of open coal transfer in human settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been set up, the issue is further law enforcement, as well as civil society positions.
There is a need for a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State, which considers the head of the charity 'Ecology for All', Leonid Bochin.
HRC member, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, Sergey Ziplenkov, in conversation with the “Investigations” stressed that a responsible social and business approach is needed to address environmental problems successfully, with few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that environmental issues are a much more positive step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, said Sergey Ziplenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the tendency that a breach of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and a car in an effort.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a chip installed so that he could open his house, enter the office, and even drive a car with a simple handhake.
Stephen North, a 30-year-old, used a tiny chip between a big and indexed finger and now, through his company, BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives on the basis of technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Winchester, in order to ensure that the application procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes 30 seconds.
Nortama also replaces locks in homes and cars with 300 pounds per lock at a price.
A single child's wife's father has already set up technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 vehicle, which is set up when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House requisition was for taxpayers in thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine TEME, the decision of the White House last month to force a marine infantry helicopter on the South Lawn for an event dedicated to the American industrial industry was worth $24,000.
The White Green Sikorskey VH-3D, known as the Marine One, when the President was on board, became a central element of the event held on 17 July in the White House, which showed American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior officials of the White House examined technological products from all fifty states.
A helicopter fired in Connecticut was removed near a hole in Man, a fire truck from Viscosin, and a missionary trucker.
According to the records of the First Escaral of Marine Infantry helicopters (HMX-1), the Air Force Department of the White House ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of a “unforeseeable” event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you knew, because this is an unusually widely publicized press event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his superior, the first Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Infant Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the shipment from White House is delayed, a second crew would be required to return the flight in accordance with hours of work restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the course of the operation, while the guard unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by TRME whether the second crew had been required.
The Hatsch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was in conflict with the order.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were told that it was not,” wrote the commander.
"It looks like you're not going anywhere," replied the Deputy Chief.
The Action in America event was announced by the White House as an official event, and has not been covered by the Hatch law.
But even official activities have political notes.
In the course of the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of health care, which had then been developed in the Senate, and commended the attempts to regulate government orders.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's not unusual to ask them for one thing for the sake of photo-capability.
Tramp was already the subject of discussion in February when the presidential plane went on the background during its first pre-election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was filed with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane.
“The White House is very excited about the American American show, where products from 50 states were presented by American American workers from American materials,” said the deputy secretary of the White House Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for the American event was taken into account by the crew in terms of the required training flights per month.
Unit helicopters also flew 11 extra hours on that day as part of “non-Presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers had no expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsy reported that the company had not participated in the demonstration of a helicopter in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the temporary rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D Ministry of Defence reimbursement rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes from its airfield based on the air base of the Kuantiko Marine Infantry in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“To calculate the value of the taxpayers based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, it is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These sample rates include personal composition, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual assimilation.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REDI Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Speiser, spoke in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea of showing this week what's happening in America,” said Spyser.
"And I know that Sicorsy and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they make their contribution to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds if not thousands of people who depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has worked so many Americans so hard to build.
It is therefore entirely appropriate, of course, to draw attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump was working with a helicopter while watching the Southern Lawn during the event, but he was in a driver's seat in a fire car.
At the White House, Trump addressed the representatives of the company Sicorskay to the press on the subject of his own fleet of products.
"I know a great Sikorsky," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants for the rehabilitation offices of the city hospitals
Saving lives will be awarded annually to the rehabilitation and intensive care units of the table nurse.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobin, visited the City Clinical Hospital named Judah.
During his examination of the clinic, he delivered a grateful letter to the Travmatologist-ortoped doctor, Viktor Prozcko, under which he led a most complex operation for the reconstruction of the steps of the adolescent.
Sergei Sobinin also described the decision to allocate grants to intensive care units in urban clinics each year.
Funds will be directed towards encouraging doctors and nurses.
According to the capital urban leader, the Communist Clinical Hospital is now one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
During the past years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the base of the Colony Rural Hospital.
Medical facilities are currently targeting over 1,000 patients.
In addition to rehabilitation and maintenance, there are day-care stations.
There are 2,800 staff in the hospital.
The total area occupied by the nurse is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the Medical Service became a participant in the short-term hospital (SCP) pilot project.
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time taken to rehabilitate patients.
They spend only a few hours after the operation.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were treated in a clinic called Judah.
Medical staff in the clinic performed 158 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
IBU reported on the lack of Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank
In Nitzbank, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no requests to buy the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
On Friday, 4 August, TSS refers to the NBU press service representative.
The NBL confirms that on 3 August 2017 a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopokeni, to agree on an indirect (res. Parittbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank's shares was withdrawn.
“No documents have been received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU”, says the report.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopina, withdrew his application for the purchase of a daughter-in-law of the Sberbank.
On 28 July, it became known that Nazbank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Said Guceriew and Güsselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian “daughter” Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported selling its Ukrainian “daughter” to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Saeed Guzeriev, son of Russian businessman Michael Gucerieva.
Sanctions against “darks” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from transferring capital from the country to the benefit of the mother ' s organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated in the UN.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have spoken on Wednesday to the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Heiss, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women stand for provincial council elections, three women fight for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement to Wednesday.
Selections can be fully representative only when women participate in them fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the electoral process, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
For the first time in this year ' s election, power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Public Prosecutor's Office approved the Nikita White Court's indictment
The Russian Attorney-General ' s Office has confirmed the indictment of a criminal case against the former Governor of Kwire province, Nikita White, accused of a large bribe.

In Venice, fines were increased for tourists for misconduct
The Venice authorities have increased the fines for purchasing from canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
For walking through a city in a swimr or with a tarts naked, they will now fine Euro200.
One hundred euros will require those who set up a picket in a public place or cycle through pedestrian areas to pass the TSS with a reference to the Russian Tourist Association.
It is also mentioned that the authorities provide fines for inscriptions on Euro400 and for trash of Euro25.
To inform tourists of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice would be through a special company entitled “Evidently Respectd Venice” (#EnojyRespitVenezia) on social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and at the destinations of the largest copies of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice Paula Mar, fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the violators in order to warn their compatriots of such errors.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the tourist trade.
Venice has already successfully restricted the number of tourists to the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festival of Festa del Renentor, only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the site.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the establishment of new fast food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, State Border Service staff detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with EU countries; all 1,059 irregular migrants were detained.

SF released Lake Lake from the post of Head of Committee
The Council of the Federation on Wednesday supported the statement by Victor Lake, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and released him from that position.
He's still the senator from Khabarov Province.
A statement requesting his release from the position of Lake has been written last week.
He explained his decision on the need to rotate and his desire to “change the rhythm of life”.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave had not been taken as a matter of urgency.
Viktor Lake has been represented by the Khabarova Legislative Assembly in the FRF since 1996.
The Senator ' s Committee on Defence and Security has been in charge since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Burundi
For a decade, efforts by the Soviet and post-Solicit authorities of the Republic of Burundi (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, 25 per cent of electricity costs have been reduced in low voltage for industrial recipients.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation on the amendment of the Regulations of the Optic Market for Electrical Energy and Power and the consolidated forecast balance of electricity production and supply (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System on entities of the Russian Federation (from 17.07.2017, No. 842), has set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Burundi.
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for drilling agents is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have struck the thresholds of Moscow ' s Cabinets in vain attempts to balance the region with the nearby Irkut region with a launch of an electric power plant in Angar, which runs out of Baikal, the main catchment area for which Burya is the main.
It's not until this year that things started to happen.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rou/kWh to 3.93 rou/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the approval of the Federal Government, the list of areas in the wholesale market prices, which set out the characteristics of the wholesale and retail markets, has become available to industrial consumers.
In the opinion of the analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/time 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to call it at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves towards the downside of Burundi.
Scoter didn't fear the State Attorney's Office and flew to Crimea

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Coke Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires assurances from the basketball managers of McVitie's because of his long-term obligation to manufacture at the Glasgow factory.
GMB reported that the company had been silent on the issue of future investment in the Tokros site.
In a factory producing more than 500 people, among other products, Hobnobs liver and Rich Tea.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years he has invested in more than five million pounds.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, the staff members and representatives of the trade union “are first to know them”.
In a letter to the company's head, the GMB Scottish office asked McVitie's to respond to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
The Senior Organizer, Drew Duffi, stated: “Our trade union's face is deeply concerned that we cannot reach clarity on the business and investment plan for the future of Tolcossa.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is large in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; this is a crucial pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social degradation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the Brexzit background, the growth of the subsistence minimum and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to be productive at McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, “The manager of the Tolcos object had just received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company would respond immediately because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with the GMB staff and representatives in Tolcrosa, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked to the staff about how all companies working under the most competitive and volatile economic climate are constantly reviewing our actions — and this concerns all of our facilities and activities — to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than five million pounds in our Tokros object, especially in the production lines and the improvement of the functional indicators”.
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a productive facility, and if any changes in the work of the facility are made, the members and representatives of the trade union will first learn of it.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnephti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas transfers to the Eastern Oil and Oil Company (NPC) must be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but that the instructions of Gasprom, like the Rosnefti, would not be given.
Thus, Russian president Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between "Rosneftha" and "Gazprom" should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
In the past, Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gasprom on gas for the NCCs jeopardized the duration of the project.
She noted that the dialogue with the “Gazprom” on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Perimeter "Rosnephti," but we don't have such resources," she added.
Recall that Roosnefti requested that she be allowed to use gas from the Kiriny Resprom on the Sahalin shelf for the “east petrochemical company”.
Gazprom stated in June that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and “there are no sharp angles”.
Did the “Barcelon” warn the “Barcelon” of the crossing of Neimar three years ago?
The La League participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratati
Parry Saint-Jerman will not stop pursuing Nymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn the Barcelona that a world record had been held three years ago?
The countervailing proposal gave life to a summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to fetch the world record at a cost of transition more than twice as much as the previous mark of the return of Paul Poughba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neimar will be the world's most expensive player, and he is also the world's most highly paid professional athlete, because SWP offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona, and the rage from the proposal, and the way Neimar broke up the contract, even though the source close to the Royal Club leadership insists, has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility, three years ago, by the President of SAF?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi's employment in 2014, Nasser Al-Khalifa issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best MVG players.
'I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going against them, we're going to make suggestions to their players' said Al-Khalifa.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, their consequences are expected."
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in a M.S.A.P.P.P.A.A.
The SPF made it clear that it would not release the Italian prefabricated player on any condition, and it was now likely that the Barcelona was experiencing the consequences of its proposal in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, Neimar.

I would also like to report on the treatment of payments and compensation to the injured citizens.

“In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues how much money has been allocated,” said Putin at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baical.

Putin was accompanied by a full-time representative of President of the Russian Federation in the Siberia Federal District, Sergey Menilo, and the head of the BGBU's branch office, Leonid Mikhaikik, who was a member of the Glaubvo.
They told me about the work of cleaning the lake.
The boys were then shown in the open room next to the container they had prepared for separation.
At first, Putin let some of the boys out of the duck.
Then I pulled a special growl on the roof of the container and let the others out.
Also during the visit, the leader was instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and build a road on the island of Olhon.
According to Minstro, one volume is required and another is expected.
"I want to figure out what's actually happening there with our funding," emphasized the Russian leader.
Recall, during the 2017 forest fires, the towns of Burtiya, Irkutsk region, were hit by fires and destroyed homes and facilities.
In Ukraine, Russians were offered to be sent to prison for illegal border crossing
