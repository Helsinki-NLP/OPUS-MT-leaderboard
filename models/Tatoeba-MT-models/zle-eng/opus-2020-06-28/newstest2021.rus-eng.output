Semilirski v. Prosecutor ' s Office: The re-locating of former Vice-Mier Tart will take place on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts rejected Semilirski ' s claim, but in April his appeal to the State Court of Justice was filed.
The Tartu Administrative Court, on 12 December 2019, appealed to the complainant because her authorization did not fall within the administrative court's jurisdiction.
The Court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The public prosecutor's office and the visiting court must deal with such matters” he explained to the ERL press secretary, Annette Crightsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilirski had appealed against this decision before the District Court, which had not changed the decision of the first instance on 5 February.
The Hossud will now have to say his word.
According to counsel Semilirski, a jury lawyer for Oliver Nees, his client for about two years was falsely suspected of bribery.
It now requires the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute the incorrect allegations and to compensate him for moral harm.
The charges made by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, in the case of the Lyana District Prosecutor ' s Office, were the reason for filing a complaint, when Semilirski, together with the other, was arrested at the time by Vice-President Tart Artem Suvrovov on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“We recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tart, one of the most influential local self-governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions were false, the Public Prosecutor's Office doesn't want to say anything about it," said Semilirski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor ' s office should operate.
"The claim of bribes and sales proved to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its rulings concerning Russia, as well as Lithuania, that at the investigation stage, representatives of States should be careful in the choice of words, so that suspects would not be represented as criminals prior to sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office also required the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately had not been observed in this case against Valvo Semilrski,” said Nees.
“Samilirski's public presentation as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and injustice against the complainant,” added counsel.
As rus.er.ee wrote, the former vice-master of Tarta Valvo Sevillerski would not be held responsible for bribery - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, a former official is charged with deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017 former Deputy Mayor Tart participated more than thirty times in town-level meetings in making decisions relating to companies operating in Tart, whose owners or leaders were actively associated at the personal level during the extra-working period.
According to Gross, in all of these cases Semilirski had personal interests, and he was therefore required to move away from participation in decision-making.
Previously, according to rus.er.ee, the Public Prosecutor's Office had alleged that it was a suspected bribe and a violation of anti-corruption legislation in transactions in a particularly large scale.
This was in October 2016, when he was detained together with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Sovorov (Centristist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both the mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case was later brought before the court, which was fully governed by politics.
The judicial inquiry in the Valvo Semilirski case is still ongoing.

How the CB's decision on reduction of the key rate will affect the economy
The bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It fell by an additional 0.25 per cent point, to 4.25 per cent of the annual one - formally the next historical minimum.
Based on the return of the short step towards lowering the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections of the Russian economy, the regulator looks more optimistic about economic prospects than before.
This means that the current round of monetary policy mitigation can soon be stopped.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, particularly given that the risks of inflation is still available from 4 per cent downwards in 2021”, reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Namibia, will take over one and a half years.
She noted, however, that after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, economic processes had reactivated: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had been restored, the construction and production of consumer goods had increased, the annual rate of reduction in traffic and production had been slowed.
According to the CB forecast, in 2020, the economy would be reduced to 4.5.5 per cent (before that, 4-6 per cent) and the economic recovery rate would be 3.5-4.5 per cent in 2021, and 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised projections at annual oil prices to US$ 38 and 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The CB used to wait 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the forecast of the Bank of Russia for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2 per cent, against previous expectations of 3.8-6.8 per cent.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, considering the economists of Russia and the CIS "Renesss Capital" by Sofia Donnet and Andrey Melashenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has steadily reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer, it has dropped to 3.5 percent.
And at the last meeting in June, the CB reduced it immediately to one percentage point because of the low inflation rate due to the low demand and the need to stimulate a slow-down pandemic and related economic constraints.
The honours of the money policy dormitory remain (at the next meeting on 18 September until the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees with the chief analyst Rosbank Eevgenius Kshelev.
The combination of inflation risks also indicates the proximity of pauses in reducing interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures and faster demand recovery (as compared to expectations), he says.
The Bank of Russia's follow-up action will require greater attention to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatility that has been raised in the background of geopolitical conflicts, points to Koshel.
In any event, a reduction in the key rate would result in further reductions in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly by mortgage, says Max Petrinović, Senior Economist of the Bank's Open-ended Analysis Office.

Survey: Lithuania’s ruling Union of Farms and Greens has again headed party ratings
The union of peasants and greens in Lithuania, headed by the ruling Sejm Coalition, headed the parties' ratings.
This showed a survey conducted by the Social Research Company Vilamorus at the time of the order of the Leitivos rictas newspaper.

However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausuda, assessing the electoral capacities of the parties, stated that the Union of Farmers and Greens, after the parliamentary elections of this year, might be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused the conservators to disagree.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were to take place today, 17.6 per cent of the voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 per cent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus Vladimir Hadidis, the opening was within error, yet the ruling authorities had ceased to leave the conservators.

The politician was the first on the list of peasants and in the 2016 elections.
The third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of the respondents are now ready to vote.

Fourth, the Labour Party, headed by a Russian businessman, Victor Uspasski (6.2 per cent).

In the autumn session, in plenary, the Gos thinkers are planning to consider a second reading of a bill setting out requirements for the content and composition of an application for procurement, to which only small and medium-sized entities can participate.
Amendments are made by the Government to the law on procurement of goods, works, services of individual legal persons.
The bill was drafted pursuant to the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on a comprehensive list of documents that employers may request from procurement participants - small and medium-sized entities.

To date, the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Certain Legal Persons Act regulates the procurement of individual legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, layout and composition of the request for procurement shall be set by the employers independently in the procurement documentation.
“The result is that the employers impose excessive requirements for the content, processing of the application, the mandatory availability of certificates, certificates, extracts, the duration of which is comparable to that of applications to the Commissioners, which results in the inability to participate in the procurement and the reduction of the procurement participants,” states the explanation of the bill.

“The adoption of the instrument will result in the exclusion of the arbitrary imposition by employers of the requirements for the composition and content of requests by participants who are entities of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship”, as stated in the explanatory note.

The authorities of Pomposka told us about the fate of the closed landfills.
Solid household wastes continue to be shut down in the sub-mount.
This year the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that exist are modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But it's not possible for every mine -- many of them grew up in dense housing.
After closing, the site is resurvived, the polygon is refilled with soils, degassing systems, and infiltrations are mounted.
This allows a halt to chemical processes within landfills so that they do not become inflamed, angry, dehydrated soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a useless pile of water in the back of her apartment.
Why don't you do something useful?
For example, in Ruz, where the rehabilitation of the Anino herb was literally completed in the day, the authorities are considering the option of making it out of a pile of rock.
The site, which was exploited from 1976 to 2016, grew to the point of moving beyond the land allocated to it.
As a result, looting had to be done on nearby sites, which had been de facto stuffed with garbage for years.
"Some time will pass, the train will rise, and we will think what can be done to get him to benefit.
It's just a blizzard. I told the journalists in the head of the Russ district of Nikolai Parthenov.
Two polygons will be renewable energy sites
The Terbeevo polygons in Lübersach and Technovo in the Borgo District will be sites for the extraction of renewable sources of energy from the landfill and biological gas.
The Torbeeva will be launched by the end of the year by a gas station capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity per year, and by the order of 0.95 Hegacalories of thermal energy, which will provide for its own needs, such as the heating of administrative and production facilities.
The "Timochono" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue as a garbage processing complex.

The beautiful high minarites only stole Aya-Sofia
And once again about Aya Sofia, there's a text on Vladimir Zelinsky, that, um, we should protest.
First of all, it's a free entrance, hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is better free of charge than paid.
Secondly, Muslims were just as honest in winning this land as Orthodoxs conquered the Volgo-Okka Interference, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozon) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God for help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
Americans have won America.
We're all gonna get everyone back?
Do you think there are no pagans who will need to return their capital, where the Tenth Church is located?
Third, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
I mean, they're just like the factories and lands that the Levites took from the bourgeois from their property, owned by the Putinians, and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angary, so they're all right progressives.
The beautiful tall minarites stole Aya-Sofia very much, very.
It was a stupid ink, a stupid ink with beautiful mortars.
Fourthly, there are no Islamic and Orthodox civilizations.
And there are believers, there are hypocrites, there are heads of faith, and there are hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
This is the thinking of British MI Da Toynby, who is so ashamed to think.
And a believing place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to leave; he withdraws and prays there.
But he is a believer, and not a defender.
We're bunnies, not bunny.

In that game, my team won, and Jordan still took 44 points," added the head of the FRB.
