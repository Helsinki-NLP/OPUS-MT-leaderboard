White's pawn on f3, black's pawn on e6, white's pawn on g4, black's bearing on h4 - mat! In chess circles, this is what's called a \"duracy mat\" in joke.
White: Chose on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites place the opponent in the condition of zugtswang, putting it on a6, after which blacks only have two options: pick up a6 or move the elephant to any other field diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move the pawn with b6 on b7 and put the mat. In the second case, the whites pick up the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
