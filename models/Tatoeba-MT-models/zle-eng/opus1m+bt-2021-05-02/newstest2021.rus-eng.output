The interim Governor of the Khabarov province, Michael Degtyrev, called for an interview with the observer of the Cambodian Truth, Alexander Gamov, not to demonize the bribes against the Mings in support of the arrested ex-head of the Sergei Furgala region.
I want to talk to all the political commentators, political scientists, all the talk shows.
We don't need to demonize the people of Khabarov.
There are hard-working and wonderful people living here, and Michael Degtyrev shared.
In an interview, Degtyrev recalled that he was a member of LDPR and a partisan of Furgala and added that he wanted luck in the court and that the party and himself, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, would support the court.
The full interview is available on KP.ru.
Previously, KP.ru reported that Michael Degtyrev had advocated an open trial of Sergei Furgal and considered it fair to conduct it in Khabarovsk.

Semilirski v. Prosecutor ' s Office: the cassation of former vice-mere Tart will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The first two courts refused to hear Semilarski ' s claim, but in April his cassation complaint was brought before the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019 because its authorization was not within its competence of the Administrative Court.
The Court ' s ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the District Court should regulate such matters - previously explained to ERR the press secretary of the Tartu Courts, Annette Kretsmann.
She said that Valvo Semlarski had appealed against the ruling before the District Court, which had not changed the decision of the court of first instance on 5 February.
Now it is up to Gossud to say his word.
According to counsel of Semilarski, juror of Oliver Nees, his client for about two years was unduly suspicious of bribery.
He now demands that the Prosecutor's Office refute the incorrect allegations and reimburse him for moral harm.
The complaint to the court was based on statements made by the Public Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Luuna District Prosecutor, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another vice-meer Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“Remember that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole of the Republic of Estonia that Tartu leaders, one of the most influential local self-governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the Public Prosecutor's Office does not want to say anything about this -- commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor ' s Office should operate.
The allegation of bribes and sales proved false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its rulings on Russia, as well as in Lithuania, that in the investigation phase, State representatives should be cautious in choosing words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski.
“Semlarski’s public presentation as a serious offender and as a bribe in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still unclear, is inadmissible, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair treatment of the complainant” added counsel.
As stated by Rus.err.ee, former vice-mere Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held liable for bribery - the criminal case against him opened in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is tried on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in town hall meetings when decisions were made by companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or leaders of whom Semilarski had been actively associated at the personal level in time.
According to Grosse, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to be suspended from participating in decision-making.
Previously, according to rus.err.ee, the Public Prosecutor's Office had suspected Semilirsky of obtaining bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in carrying out transactions of a particularly large size.
This occurred in October 2016 when he was detained with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Sovorov (Centrist Party).
The Public Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police then stated that there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
Both officials were then retired.
The Suvorov case later reached a court that fully justified the policy.
The case of Valvo Semilarski is still under investigation.

The effect on the economy of the CBS' decision to lower the key rate
The bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It was down by a further 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25 per cent of the annual points, a formal historical minimum.
Based on the return of a brief reduction step, as well as the tone of the CBS statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation may soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that there are still risks of downward inflation from 4% in 2021” reported the head of the Russian Bank, Elvir Nabyullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, the fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabyullina, will take more than one and a half years.
It noted, however, that, following the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic, the economic processes had been revitalized: energy, consumer and investment demand, the construction and production of consumer goods had been restored, and the annual rate of slowing down of freight traffic and manufacturing had slowed.
According to the revised CBS forecast, in 2020, the economy would be reduced by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (previously 4 to 6 per cent), while the recovery growth in 2021 would be 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, and by 2022 it would be 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia has revised the annual oil prices forecast to $38 and $40 for the Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, against the earlier expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation becomes more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, is seen by economists for Russia and the CIS - Renaissance Capitala - Sofya Donets and Andrei Melaschenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate over the past year by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting, in June, the CB lowered it by one percentage point, owing to the low inflation rate due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the slowing pandemic and its associated economic constraints.
The prizes for monetary policy remain (at the next meeting, on 18 September and the end of the year), but the limit is near, and the main analyst, Rosbank, Eugeny Koschelev, agrees.
The combination of inflationary risks also points to the proximity of pauses in the mitigation of interest policies, the resulting supply chains, the possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic and the faster (as compared to the expectations) the recovery of demand, he says.
To complete its follow-up, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to inflation during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatilism that has increased in the face of geopolitical conflicts, points out Koschelov.
In one way or another, a drop in the key rate will lead to a further drop in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, and perhaps on a mortgage basis, says the Bank's Senior Analyst - Discovery - Maxime Petronević.

Survey: The Governing Union of peasants and Greens - Lithuania has again headed party ratings
The Alliance of peasants and Greens - Lithuania, head of the Seima ruling coalition, led the party ranking.

Recently, however, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Naussada, assessing party electoral capabilities, stated that the Alliance of peasants and Greens, after this year ' s parliamentary elections, would probably be able to re-establish a coalition.

Eligible requirements for applications for State procurement are excluded by law
The legislation may impose exhaustive requirements on applications for procurement.
In the autumn session of the plenary, the Heads of State plan to consider on second reading a draft law requiring the content and composition of an application for procurement to which only small and medium-sized businesses can participate.
Amendments are being made by the Government to the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Legal Persons -
The project was designed to implement the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprise Development in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on the exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to request from procurement participants - small and medium-sized enterprises.
Also, the list of requirements for the documents indicated.
To date, the Law on the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Certain Legal Persons governs the procurement activities of certain types of legal persons.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the purchase request are set by the customers on their own in the procurement documents.
“The result is that the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, processing of the application, compulsory availability of certificates, certificates, receipts of which are comparable to the time frame of application before the authorized authorities, which makes it impossible to participate in such procurement and to reduce the number of members of the procurement”, in explanation of the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to request from procurement participants who are members of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The adoption of the document would eliminate the arbitrary imposition by the customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications by participants of small and medium-sized enterprises, as set out in an explanatory note.

Sub-Moscow authorities have reported on the fate of closed dumps
In the Sub-Moscow, solid waste fields continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern recycling facilities.
But it's not possible for every range -- many of them have grown into a dense housing structure.
After the polygon is closed, it stands for recycling - the polygon body is overrun with soil, gas and infiltration systems are mounted.
This allows the chemical processes inside the landfill to be stopped from flammating, evil, and soil and groundwater.
Then, the former dump remains to be raised by a useless heap among its dwelling structure.
Why don't you make something useful out of her?
For example, in Ruz, where the recycling of polygon - Anino was literally completed in days, the authorities are considering making it out of a heap of mining slopes.
The site, which operated from 1976 to 2016, had grown so far that it had gone beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in recycling, it was necessary to buy back neighboring areas that had been de facto buried with garbage.
- It'll take some time, the range will sit down, and we'll think what we can do to get it to work.
Right in the eye is a mining resort, and he told the journalists, the head of the Russ district, Nikolay Parthenov.
Two valleys will become renewable energy mining sites
The Torbeev and Lubertz and Timohovo sites in the Bogorod district will be renewable-energy sites from landfills and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas power plant capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and some 0.95 gigacals of heat energy, which will provide its own needs for the site, will be launched in Torbeev.
Timohevo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue to operate as a garbage processing unit.
And a museum could be built on the Balachian Kuchino site, which was closed down after the residents' complaints on the Frame Line, with the President of the country.
“It was this idea to create a museum for the recycling of Podmoskovya polygons,” reported the government’s deputy Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management Dmitry Kurakin.

I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is better free of charge than paid.
Secondly, Muslims were as honest as they conquered the land as Orthodox conquests of the Volgo-Ok intercessors, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God's help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans won the American.
We're gonna get everyone back?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will need to return their bonfires where the Tenth Church is located?
Thirdly, Muslims improved the building and invested it.
That is, it's just like the factories and the houses that the Lenses took from the bourgeois, owning the Lenins, Putin, and other nomenclature.
They improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so that's all right-wing progressers.
Beautiful high-end minarets have grossly decorated Aya Sofiya, very.
There was a stupid nun, a stupid nun with beautiful minarettes.
Fourthly, there are none of the Islamic - and - Orthodox - civilizations.
There are some believers, some hypocrites, some foreigners, some of them believers and some of them hypocrites.
He who believes in categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the thinking of a British MlID official Toynbee, a believer who's ashamed to think so.
And to the believer the whole place of prayer.
And always.
He who believes does not pray except where he is asked to be removed, is removed from his place, and prays therein.
But he is a believer, not an advocate.
We're pieces, we're not gonna make room.
