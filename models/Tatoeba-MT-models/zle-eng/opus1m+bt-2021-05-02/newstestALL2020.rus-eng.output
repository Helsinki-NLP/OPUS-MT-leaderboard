TikTok is hiding bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
TikTok, China's social network, censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or Falungun's banned religious group, tells The Guardian.
Documents from the publication explain that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is promoting China's foreign policy objectives abroad by means of an annex.
Most of China's policy violations are motivated by incitement to hatred
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China ' s socialist system falls under the general prohibition of - criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.
The prohibition against referring to incidents in the Tiananmen Square or the Cambodia genocide falls under the distortion of the history of China or other countries -
The document also contains a list of prohibited names of twenty foreign leaders or public figures - including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong-Yin, Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak King Hi, Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, and Indian Premier Narendr Modi, as contained in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, said in the document.
Category I publications are removed by the social media and may entail user lock-in.
Not too severe is the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules were outdated and that they were no longer applied: “We now use a localized approach to modernize, as well as engaging independent local professionals.”
Russian users TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, and he tells the founder of the “Producer’s Center, Rustem Bogdanov. ”
- A Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All bloggers' promotional materials, the Production Centre, are in line with the social media, but user materials can be posted without consultation, and can be passed on to Bogdans.
To the question of whether TikTok speaks of politics or Putin, Goddanov answers yes and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of the Agency, Our Didgita Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: there is no shocking content, discriminating remarks, and so on.”
But it's possible to undermine any content that doesn't like the moderators, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
By user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The administrators of the social media examine their age with the help of artificial intelligence: Neuroses analyzes persons and determines how many years a person looks, tells Bogdans.
If neuroses decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in WeWork covorkin.

Money is more important than football.
- Barcelona - blackmails Neymar
Spanish-Barcelona- and her former football player, Brazilian Neymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that has arisen since the French-invasive-Parry Saint-Jerman-
The case almost got to court, but the Catalans offered the player a solution to the dispute without Femida's intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse him back.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilians, had an interesting focus: according to the Barsay agreement, which the player signed in 2016, he had to get 40 million euros.
However, in a literal year, the Forum was established as “APM” over a record €222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In short, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest in the payment gap.
When Neymar’s claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, “Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Grants insist that the bonus was relied on for the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, at the club, the player is of the opinion that only a quarter of Euro40 million was placed and that a proportional portion of the first payment was required.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer of Neymar and Barsa, we've almost agreed to get back a pale -- a player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal has broken down, but the hope of a back door shift remains.
According to Sports.Ru, referring to the insiders, the club lawyers told the players that if the financial claims were not settled pre-trialally, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asks for assurances that the Catalans will buy him back.

A man with a samurai sword tried to keep a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the United States city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he swung a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute because of a cart found in garbage.
Curtis Miller, 54-year-old, was digging into a pile of garbage near an empty house.
That's what Todd Bevers saw last night's walk.
The latter decided to join in the search and found a black cart among the casts.
Miller saw Bivers's find and was upset.
He thought he could claim to be on the TV because he was the first to dig in the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bivers grabbed a cart and ran with it towards his home.
Then Miller took the same sword he found in the same heap of samurai and pursued the opponent.
He got Bivers near his house.
Miller pulled his sword out of his nose and began swinging in the direction of the weaver.
Bivers told Miller that what happened was recorded on the video.
Seeing the camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Bivers left the cart in the yard and entered the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman enter his yard and take the cart away, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller to drive an unrighted car.
The man was detained and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the United States city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager had attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.

Massive disturbances on the three
- Moscow case - against the participants in the summer protests the more, the more marked the breakup into individual fragments and the loss of political fill.
Evidence of the fact - mass unrest - does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to drop the case on the brakes, a weak evidentiary basis would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The breakdown of the case must inspire society, but it must be left to the vicissitudes, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused at para. 212 of the Criminal Code (massive disturbances) - Alexey Minhailo was suddenly released without obligation, and after a few hours and fully rehabilitated: the CDC withdrew the charges.
Minyaylo was arrested for nearly two months and was replaced by several professional communities — historians, priests, writers.
The case then remained only two accused of mass disturbances (originally 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was arrested before the trial until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authority, article 318 of the Criminal Code).

Would phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong their youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous are pine pollen.
The phytoestrogens are being studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (in the midst of cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (the most popular is soya), hops, and flax seeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
It is not possible to exclude any possible harm from such additives.
For example, in the event of their reception, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that too many analogies from the outside are produced in the body.

The hotbeds were scattered two thousand miles [2,000 km] away.
Reports of the first oil stains discovered began on the second September.
However, with each day up to Thursday, the number has continued to increase, as has territorial coverage.

It may be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleared.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean, which told Brazil's G1 news portal, the coordinator of the oil trade union of Pernambuco and Paraiba Roggio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
At the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country, environmental defenders discovered nine sea turtles full of oil.
Only two of them managed to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment will work with Petrobras to clean up the contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute recommends that tourists and local residents go around the oil stains and report all the contamination that has been discovered.

There's no way for Russians to retire -- V. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Federation's Council, Valentina Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to give full effect to the draft law on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings worldwide is quite common.
Another matter is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes, from which there is nothing to be done to increase pensions in the future,” stated V. Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the creation and calculation of pensions, since the permanent changes in this area have permanently confused them -
This does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
Russia is a social nation, and we have to do everything to ensure that pensions, the social security of citizens, are improved.
But steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities, - stated B. Matvienko - RIA News -
The Head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the Guaranteed Pension Product Bill) was to develop, there should be several basic principles, including volunteerism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility to protect pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that it had been sent to agree on a draft law on guaranteed retirement product (PPP).
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary accession of citizens to the savings system, the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of civil savings accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agreed
Right-hand image owner Getty Images Image caption News of the departure of a favorite superhero from a Kinoskele Marvel has provoked anger among many loyal worshipers
One of the most famous comic heroes, Spider-Man, will be the one who's been killed by Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures have been able to agree on the rights to use it in franchise films.
This came to light from a Sony press release stating that the third part, Spider-Man, with Tom Holland, would be screened on 16 July 2021.
Previously, Disney and Sony Pictures were reported to have been unable to reach a consensus on income-sharing, causing the Spider-Man to leave the King-in-Man Marvel.
Sony owns the cinema rights.
She rented them for Marvel's films, which is Disney's.
As a result, Sony earned income from profits in cinemas and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that, at some point, Disney had ceased to comply, and the company wished to reconsider the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was delighted.
It's amazing that Spade's journey to Marwell's kinsmen will continue.
- All of us at Marvel Studios are very pleased to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a character figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and the audience around the world -- he says in his press release.
At the same time, Faigi recalled that Sony was also creating its own pocket-like, built just around the Spider-Man.
- So it happened that he's the only super-powerful hero to find himself in different Kinoskeles.
So as Sony continues to develop its own Spade Universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises, he noted.
Tom Halland, who played the Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, put in his account in Instagram, a piece of the film \"Volk-Wall Street\" in which Leonardo di Caprio screams \"I'm not leaving\"
Information on conflicts between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash from the Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of painting.
But that wasn't good for Sony.
News of the possible departure of a loved superhero from the Kinoskelen Marvel caused anger among many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been addressed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have cooperated perfectly for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [The Spider-Man].
We're glad we can go forward together.

A team of researchers from Canada from McGill University found that more than 10 billion microplastic particles fall into a cup in five minutes.
In a packaged drink, they can also add pieces of opium, said Nation News expert in the area of food safety Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to the agronomics, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the producer may add ingredients that will not be marked on the package.
The polls are not thrown out at the end of the season, so they may be in the waiting room.
- In fact, the packages don't always include tea plants.
She said that it would be better to give up the use of such a drink in order to enjoy the entertainment sold at specialized stores.

“It’s best to buy pure green tea or black tea — the drink will have the least addition in it,” the expert said.

Delivery - Russia fell 100 times
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural and food products to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin to the RF, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries, compared to 3 million 442,000 tons for a similar period in 2013, reports Interfax -
At the same time, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million, from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the case in the case of shipments of goods that were not subject to embargoes.
As the report indicates, the amounts of imported prohibited products have been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It will be recalled that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the regulations on the destruction of agricultural production, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal indicated that the rules were extended by one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially, the destruction ordinance applied to products from the United States, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Ukraine, was added to the list.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the illegal import into the country of Sanction (food embargo products, which Moscow had introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government allowed the destruction of “sanctional food” by any legal means.
As the West sanctions persisted, the RF has also extended its response.
However, the measure does not extend to produce that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, had previously described it as “just immoral — the destruction of food, ” he said, as a negative influence on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, the initiative was launched in early June with the initiative to ban the destruction of food-fits-for-use food.
A similar recommendation was then made by the Government to the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.

According to ESO, this week the construction of the E-ELT dome of the building was officially started, as long as the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project was completed.

The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 six-coal segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the environs of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has only been built, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the scientific observatory, engineers and other experts have been developing for three years - since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The main mirror contract, with a total value of about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and Safran Reosc, a French company.
