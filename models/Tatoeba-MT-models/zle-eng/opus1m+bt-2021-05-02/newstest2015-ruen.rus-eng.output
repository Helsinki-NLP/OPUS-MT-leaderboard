FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will, together with RA, hold the third Expert Session - Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations -
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year and will be reported in a press release, edited by Lent.Ru -
The third meeting is scheduled to take stock of the work of the Expert Session in a year and to produce an outcome list of indicators for the evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
Participants plan to discuss rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the closing event in the series of events to create a unified approach for all three academyes to the methodology for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative documents has been agreed upon.
As a follow-up to the next session, we should complete the process of science and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation,” said the Chief of Expert Analysis, Fano, Russia, Elena Aksenov.
Representatives of more than one hundred scientific institutions in Russia will participate.
It is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m., Moscow Time, on 16 September 2014, at the address of the city of Moscow, Soljanca Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbidity mixing and its effects on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will make it possible to find a related, that is, one cluster of stars.
The authors published their findings in Nature and are briefly available on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is caused by the turbidity of mixing in clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition may determine its place of birth and its region of formation.
Previously, scientists had doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the modelling carried out by astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer experts modeled two interstellar gas flows that formed the cloud together.
This object, for several million years under its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster where the stars begin to form.
Scientists added paint tags to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud had resulted in a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it is possible to find birth stars by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions for the formation of such objects.
The Carrata police arrested 20 years after pursuing a motorcycle at high speed
Motocycle was confiscated after being driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through a bushland to hide from the Pilbar police.
The Carrat transport police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h when he left service station at Batgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcycle did not stop and continued on the Burgess Road, then turned to the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.

Lavrov: Russia will not take the door - in the face of new sanctions and will not get out of WTO
Russia won't take the door for new sanctions.
The head of the RFF, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the MGIMO, said this today.
Regarding the response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, he said that I would not even argue, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated.
And when we understand what European and American partners are going to like about it, then we're going to make decisions about how to respond to it.
This would not involve the cuffing of doors, some insults, some misunderstands, the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, look away from our interests, interests in protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the partners' actions on their adequacy, bargaining capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions could be very well judged by the partners, which continued to be led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
If the voice says that they're going to hurt us too, but we're going to have to take it to punish Russia -- it's probably not adequate --
With regard to WTO, there is no response to possible new sanctions.
On the other hand, we want to better develop the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, as Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of demping while applying anti-dumping measures against the industries of the Russian Federation.
“We are prepared to take advantage of the WTO’s mechanisms and to defend our position that the EU’s third energy package should not be allowed to apply retrospectively” said Lavrov.
How do you use the sirens in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the siren loses its main appeal after flowering, it is desirable that it be planted with other shrubs.
It blends well with many cultures.
You can and should plant both decorative plants at other times and flowers at the same time.
Another plus siren is that it provides a lot of creativity.
You can build it with a staff tree of various heights, enhanced with bitumen, wide-founded bush, and even the likeness of a garden bonsai tree with a squeakly curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that fits the design of your garden.
A Leningrad district resident convicted of selling counterfeit money in Karelía
As reported in the Republican Ministry, the man was engaged in criminal fishing in the Olonetsk and Segesg.
In addition to Carelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in Volodsky, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years in the spring of this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Allonese District Court.
And to end the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was categorised in Segesu.
The investigation proved guilty of several cases of counterfeit money sales relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, indictment files were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the prison term with four years ' imprisonment in the general regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into legal force.
Recall that in the past week, two other counterfeiters were convicted of paying them at Petrozawatersk stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One of them is five years ' imprisonment, the other four years ' imprisonment.
Each person has a fine of 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into legal force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy - Dervish -
The rally at the district center was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervise delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arhangelsk, a memory rally was held at the hostage stone of a future monument to the northern convoys, located on the coast name of Sedov in Solombala.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations Arhangelska, children from the cadetic class.
For the first time, we met twenty - three years ago when the hostage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event, not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned the sea, was observed by the chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Marine Parody, Boris Karpov.
Next came an orchestra of the city spirit, and students of the Cadeta class gave the veterans flowers and routed the flags of Russia and the sign of victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the laying stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, there were also military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, and fifteen Harritain fighters - in a select state.
At the same time, the convoy escort was 16 British Navy ships, of which two were aircraft carriers.
Caravan of the courts was not detected by an opponent and reached its destination well, Arhangelska.
A total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations lost 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels.

Remembering the very American idea that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
“Where trade unions, there and the middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive Fracture Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act, together with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement, by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide employees with the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination, halting the forces of opponents of trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Regulation Act to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill offer is to remember a very American idea.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Toddo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed -
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or occupation.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be found to be illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights in 1948 to be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of his interests”
Through generations, Americans have accepted the basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's forces, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised a whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers what we should do.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the increased protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - are long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Luizian Bobby Jinalm in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who had abortions would be required to have the authority to take patients to hospital for a 30 mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors may, to date, continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to act on their authority,” wrote Judge John deGrevells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled for the month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Protectors of the right to abortion were pleased to meet this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“The current decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a covariant law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed an action to halt the law from three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied for admission to doctors from two clinics that had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and had also submitted an application for admission.
Louisiana is a member of 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
The right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, is said to impose restrictions on medical doctors.
The opponents of abortion object that such measures are designed to protect women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing the clinics.
Only one doctor, who had abortions in Louisiana, had access to a hospital, told the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the State were forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor would not have been able to carry out the procedure, the group said, in fear of his safety.
In criticizing this decision, the Luiziana officials said that they would not punish the abortion doctors while their applications for admission were pending.
This will lead to quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each product in the trade network must be Russian, the representative of the State of State of fact, Fair Russia, Oleg Nile.
The Parliamentarians have prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, which is written by the newspaper - Investia -
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
This is the case of goods not produced in Russia. \" ... > For the remaining groups of products produced in Russia, the ritiller will have to provide at least half of his parcels to domestic producers \" , reported the Nile publication.
Together with the amendments to article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% per cent quota in trade networks is included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic products on the stalls.
However, experts have both positive and negative effects.
According to Nalogovik, a member of the Independent Expert Centre Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
The plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means that profits grow.
They will also have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the ritellers, since they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their business and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will recover faster, and some will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline a few times, but it's not immediately -- notes the expert.
Russian enterprises had often been unable to get into local shops because of the high competition of foreign counterparts.
Now, after the embargo has been imposed, the niche has been released and can be breathed in with relief.
It should not be forgotten, however, that after all the necessary harmonization and sanitary checks, the Russian market will receive food items from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now is the moment of the suspense moment, when the former players have left and the new players have not yet come.
Almost a month later, the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rising prices of finished products, was presented by A.F.ru, the first Vice-President of a general Russian social organization, the Russian Financial Directors ' Club, Mr. Tamara Kasjanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would help to secure the sector behind local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that by means of subsidies from another State are cheaper.
In other words, the struggle for a buyer is fought between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, it notes Kasjanova that Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
And in this situation, the trading networks will have to - reach - the share of Russian goods to half their range.
As a result, there is an increasing fear that non-quality products will be made available to the stalls.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be delivered under the type of products produced in Russia, adding an expert.
Large trading networks have had a negative impact on quotas, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by such a schedule, as the demand for their products will decline.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the Domestic Product Quotas Act may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian products may give in quality to imported counterparts, while stores can run the prices of the second as scarce goods.
The forgotten idea of imports in the early 2000s was again raised by economists in February this year due to the continued devaluation of the rouble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of the abandonment of imported products becomes even more relevant.
The law is intended to require sterlers to be treated by domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident along the path of imports, and the production planning system for the required products will be set up in a shorter time-frame, says the deputy Oleg Nilov.
A quota mechanism would be particularly effective for agricultural sectors where capacity was particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover all the shacks of Russian shops.
Meat production can also get a strong boost.
As is known, the largest share of imports is preserved by beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65-70 per cent of Russia's products do -- they're talking about Kasjanova.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate and facilitate the process of import substitution.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, certain of Litvinenko.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, and therefore full import would not occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
In addition, little quotas had to be set, and domestic production had to be initiated in the country to meet those quotas.
The quotas would provide such guarantees, and the expert would note.
The late diagnosis and the lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother's memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers examined the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis was reported.
A leading researcher, Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research, reported that the likelihood of dying 20 per cent higher in a study is for those who live in the regions and remote areas of the state than for those who live in urban areas.
NON-ALIGNED STUDIES: New drugs can inhibit lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current disease and socio-economic status also affected survival.
Older women and those whose cancer was at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote state areas, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in travel services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were far away from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that life expectancy for women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at 33 years of age, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elysa Niw, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will open doors in the Kujener district in September
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibalak was started in April this year and followed a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Directorate of Public Relations and Information of the Head of the Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was financed from the Republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
This area will receive medical attention from the inhabitants of eight settlements: Toktaibalak and the villages of Dementievo, Püncherumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybalak, Shinir and Chaschayal.
The new paramedic-acoussier would replace the existing FAP, which had been built in 1918 and had long since exhausted its resource and had not met health and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son will be tried.
A Chuwashiya resident will be found on a bench of defendants for the murder of her own child.
A criminal investigation into a 31-year-old Novcheboxarska resident accused of causing death because of negligence was completed in Cheboxar.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month-old son, arrived to celebrate the birth of her baby in Cheboxar.
After a long stay, the newcomer decided to stay in the guest and took the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and wept at night, the uncut woman put him next to her bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son, causing him to die of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, the SSRC press service for Chuwashia, is referred to the court.
Inflation came out of vacation.
Russia’s Sharpest Prices
Cross sanctions of the RF and West make inflation in Russia faster and less likely for the authorities, and the analysts - VTB Capital - are convinced to do so.
Experts are of the view that the delayed effects of unsanctions will result in inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, with RBC Daily.
According to the latest Minnesota Development Project, inflation will be 6.5.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014, which will be less than 6.5 per cent in next year.
However, according to the newspaper Commersant's report, this week the IED should make a small but principled adjustment to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower inflation estimates for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected fall in income growth.
Food sanctions of the RF were expected to operate for a year, until August 2015.
How could inflation have been so high in such a situation?
The current situation is a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change,” said a newspaper source in Gryffindor.
Capital economists do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic bloc of inflation and forecast an 8 per cent increase in prices in 2014.
Experts are convinced of the main effect of product bans, along with the possible sale tax (NFP) in the RF regions in 2015.
The inflation peak of 9% will be February, followed by annual price increases expected by experts.
By the way, last week Rosstat produced the first inflationary results after the RF imposed “accurate sanctions”
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
Price increases have already been observed in the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially relevant products began to be valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of an undue increase in prices in the short term.
Providers and pilots are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators, so that the authorities know exactly who, when and why price increases are initiated.
Major factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion by foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure were to remain under control, the cost of the basket of the minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12 per cent in a single quarter.
The ban on the importation of food produced a shock to the supply on the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in end value.
As we are not able to fully launch the import mechanism at this stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to carry the risk of inflationary growth.
If fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency and the deteriorating prospects for economic growth are added, inflation could well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
(Signed) Alexander Razawaev, Director, Analysis Department, Alparía
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, zero also above the current level, and another case was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think after the year, inflation will be between 8 and 8.5%.
Plato Magut, the U.K.-Fund Maguta asset manager
The externality of sanctions against Russia has so far been successful, but if there is further pressure on the financial sector, first and foremost, it may lead to certain difficulties and to increased inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually found to be in cash currency purchases in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the C.B. of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will endeavour to reduce the smooth weakening of the rouble, both by market methods and by government regulation.
But price increases traditionally begin after summer twilight, and perhaps this fall will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is likely to stand at 7.5 per cent, as the Russian Federation has still financial savings.
Gardening centres grieve over the decline in the number of homeowners
This fall, due to an exceptional decline in the number of owners under 35 years of age, could cause horticulture centres to lose tens of millions of pounds a year, when today ' s young consumers reach the basic age of horticulture, according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, people who are renters spend, on average, 55 per cent of the amount that owners spend on horticulture.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting in front of a parking house, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, estimated at £5 billion annually.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest cost to gardeners per household is.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that the rental of housing and the lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: “The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move —
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of horticultural trade in horticultural goods, resulting from an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also suggests that the market will improve this year with better weather after the adverse conditions of March and April of last year.

I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't posted on the Foundation website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I'll learn more on Monday.
It will be taken over by Ivanka Bogdatova, who was still the head of Investment Credit, in a central fund at Landdelia, in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
To date, it has been responsible for direct subsidies for EU-paid fields.
He will be assigned to his seat by Vicko Vivkov, who was the head of the Landdeleda Foundation Regional Directorate in the town of Velico Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Aliyev-Veli Foundation maintained his post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey is calling for an American diplomat to report spying
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has created the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British spying in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Büllent, reported that the United States defendant and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet Journal The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Recep Taipe Erdogan of Turkey overstated the importance of this report by saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Previously reported that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara an object of exploration, and had given rise to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Major Chinese companies joined forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which China's largest commercial real estate vehicle, Dalian Wanda Group, and Tencent Holdings (co-sets, Messrs., etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the marvel of the Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, would not be easy.
Union of Major
Companies plan to invest in a joint venture of 5 billion yuan $814 million, 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent each of the Internet companies is reported in the Wanda Group.
It's planned to register a firm in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest community in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 high-income hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film and a special entertainment park in Qindao, China’s eastern garden on the Yellow Sea.
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors each year and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the AMC Entertainment Holdings United States cinema network, making it the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to provide all its trading centres, hotels and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which will be developed by an Alibaba competitor.
According to Dun Cee, who will lead the new company, the Wanda network will be able to increase the number of e-Commerce users from the current 40 million to 100 million by the following year.
The new site should be the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Cee.
The point of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to access regular off-line games or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sales services for coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
-O2O, the largest pie in online commerce, was said by the head of Wanda Wang Jianlin (quoted on Bloomberg).
The present O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation the chances for everyone are approximately equal - he believes.
The China Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and the McKinsey & Co estimates that it will more than triple by 2015, to $395 billion.
China's Internet users have grown to 632 million, bringing Bloomberg's official statistics: it's more of a population anywhere in the world, except India.
It is projected that by 2015 this number could have risen to 850 million.
Union of the Riches
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was by far the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, had already been overrun by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's state is estimated to be $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now ranked third among China's richest people, whereas Wang Jianlin of Wanda is ranked four.
“ This battle is an interesting experience: three of the richest people join together to challenge the even richer.” said Bloomberg, director of the China Electronic Commerce Research Centre in Hangzhou Tzao Lay.
But he thinks that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba once it's created: \"Rome can't be built in one day\"
The fact that it is not that it is easy to compete with Alibaba not only with new companies but also with well-deserved leaders of the world Internet trade shows the previous financial performance report of Alibaba in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
The net return of Alibaba over the period was almost twice as high as the cumulative total of competitors - it grew almost three times annually to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has great potential to generate money, thanks largely to its mobile applications,” commented Bloomberg, an analyst from Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile service users in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March figure (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter have involved mobile devices.
Alibaba is to be named the value of its shares in front of the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after stock sales.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on 16 September.
Road show is about to start on 3 September.
Alibaba output on the IPO is expected to be a record in the history of NYSE and will enable the company to attract around $20 billion.
Thus far, Visa’s payment system, a record of US marketed funds, had spent $17.9 billion in 2008 on the primary location of its shares.
At least half of the food items in trade should be from Russian production, and members of the Parliament are considered to be from the State.
They've drafted a bill on this subject.
These are the amendments to article 8 of the FO on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to provide protective measures to Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be made with a scab to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Russian Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of all food items originating in Russia, reports the newspaper - Republic of India -
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower house of Parliament to amend the FO-O retail market, which proposes to re-establish farming markets in Russia where small producers will be able to market their products.
The Chief of Police of Magalouf has been charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The Calvia police chief on the resort island of Malorca was arrested in the wake of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous center of Magaluffa’s unbridled drinking.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained on charges of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street where the majority of Magaluff ' s bars and nightcluf clubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia at the office of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the guards of the Spanish National Guard in connection with allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism on the part of the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
“ It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving, ” said one businessman to the court.
We cannot be threatened by our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluff got into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who would leave 24 men behind during a bar run.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to put an end to the blasphemous blasphemies among the rest of Magaluff, minimizing the number of scandalous alcoholic runs at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the runners of the Carnage bars were jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluff Tourist resort, mainly popular with young British vacationers, has also been the scene of many accidents involving alcohol related to the foolish fun known as `balconing' when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
THE wind prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that had an impact on the flights to the airport of Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of brief torrential torrents, including a storm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave up the early spring season last week, the temperature fell again Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The conditions are expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it hit the wind shift zone - suddenly changing the speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Windbreaks reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off during its second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight caused a subsequent delay in several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two vents.
The calculation of construction sites at the RF will be a new one.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service has special control over pricing, construction regulation and network connectivity issues.
The FAS has established an advisory board for building competition.
At its meeting, the Head of Control of JKX, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS, Wadim Solovyev, stated that “the calculation of the estimates for construction facilities is totally incomprehensible each year”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unsubstantiated construction price, is considered by the FAS.
And they suggest the cost of building public sites at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, constructive solutions instead of today's estimated standards and unit costs for technological transactions.
These proposals have been submitted to the road map and are currently under consideration in the minstrel.
The replacement of traditional estimates in construction by design elements should result in less corruption in the industry, explained Wadim Solovyev.
After all, every bolt and hook is now counted in the estimates, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes bad construction companies can bury whole tractors in the records -
Mister and FAS agree.
The first costing of costing for design elements is already in progress: methods have been developed to calculate and estimate the prices of design solutions, and the Chief of Urban Development and Architecture, Elena Joukov.
The area of road construction has been chosen as a pilot.
Experts, however, believe that the problem is much more serious.
As reported by the head of the construction company, Profi Invest, Anatoly Demianco, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
As for the proposed design element calculations, in practice this is difficult to implement, since the construction of buildings often uses entirely different technologies - he believes.
It's no secret that the structure is developing in a lot of ways thanks to the state-of-the-art order.
In the opinion of the President of the NP-Expert Community of Professionals, Catherine Lesin, the State is today the most costly customer.
The engineer director of the industrial centre for the capital construction of Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that the market is now divided explicitly into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and to companies with monopoly competences and non-competitive competitors.
He believes that a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is as secure as possible from one ' s managerial influence.
The expert board was requested to establish a system of state-of-law in such a way that the same perpetrator was not entitled to receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion roubles.
The Mister believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of impact on business as well as efficiency in construction management.
As Elena Joukov explained, in this case, it would be necessary to provide the customer with the functions of the contractor's gene, which would result in an increase in the customer's staffing and budget costs.
At the same time, the customers will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality and security of the work done by the contracting organizations.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified participants due to a lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time jobs and a small amount of contract.
The advisory and advisory centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustaschenko, is of the opinion that the state-of-law procedure has now become a business-to-business-to-interest contractor.
Here is an example: - The participant in the application should specify - specific figures - without the words: - or the equivalent - should - be - less - less - less - less - less - less than - less than - less than - not above - are not allowed, etc.
In this way, customers often abuse their right to impose requirements for the content of the bid submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem, 44-FZ, according to Eustachenko, was the need to assess the quality of work through a paper proposal at the request stage.
In considering the applicant ' s application, only the qualifications of the contractor can be evaluated, but not the quality of the work that has not even been undertaken, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is received.
The expert board was also asked to transfer marginal income from the top to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the State Secretary, the Deputy Director of the FAS, Andrey Tsorikovski, believes that this should not be done, since a gender contractor must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's going to be in the well-known Arcadey Reykin-Atelé, which is the case for pugists.
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip again went to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from hostilities.
The beginning of the school sessions brought joy and excitement to the victims of the missiles to the settlements in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, child - care workers at Pashosh, in which the rocket was fired, removed traces of debris from the walls and children’s bitters before the disciples arrived.
- We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look into the future. - Ronit Bart, a Kibutz Saad resident, and an English teacher at his school.
Many of the children in our area really need to return to a long-term life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it would be strange to start going to school again...
- It was a tough time, and we didn't leave our homes at all, she said.
President Reuwen Rivalin visited the Kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go outside or leave their homes, left to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that he should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which had been heavily affected by the Palestinian fire.
He told the children to learn carefully and said: “We will do our best to provide you with knowledge and to ensure your safety.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a permanent truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of whom three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel challenges these figures and argues that at least half of the casualties were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 missiles and mines on Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and fighting continued, officials responsible for education postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
- I hope that the school will soon be open so that we can complete our education as children from all over the world and as Jewish children, - said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is now living in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular real estate price test, the highest winter rise in seven years was.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for Australia's capital grew by 1.1 per cent in August, and RP data was reported on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the rate in 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed throughout the country.
The Director of Research, RP Data Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne had a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices have risen by 16.1 per cent in Sydney over the last year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which resulted in governmental cost reductions, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowless said that when spring began, there would be an increase in the number of estates displayed for sale over the next few months, which would be a real test for the market.
“In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current low interest rate, it is likely that housing costs will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Old Ufa House
In the former home of Eudokim gold miners and miners and his son, Ivan Damidov, on the street of the October Revolution, 57/1 (the former Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
From the 18th century onward, the house of construction has not changed much, apart from its merriment.
Foreigners go here on a tour, and tenants suffer more than joy from their privilege of living in an older Finnish house whose walls are remembered by the general Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, and historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out to be a building with no age of 300.
Old court, always open door, squeaking stairs.
The door to the apartments is close to each other, the walls are shaken, and the streets are visible in the light of the entwined plaster.
I think it's all right to say that.
And the locals believe: \"You don't think that's what it is.\"
Living in a 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lucianov, a resident of an apartment No. 3.
The object is on the public guard, but the money for its maintenance has not been set aside for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten about.
Last repaired 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin, but the foundation's gone.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and pray once a week in a public bath.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road is right below the windows, not even the pedestrian area.
Tatiana is moving the curtain away.
Now you can see what happened before that, and you can see that there is a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is everywhere, the windows can't open, and the noise is used.
But the man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still fine, thank you husband, his hands are golden.
In fact, we have two rooms, three with our son.
And for other families, conditions are much worse, on the second floor at least a half mile [1.5 m] high.
For contrast, Tatiana proposes to visit a neighbor of apartment 6 at Ludmile Starstina.
A friendly, hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we have a husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never another residential site, and Sophia's eyes are in the room: the antressoli, the two couches with the letter 'g', and one of them is the granddaughter with the laptop.
Very close and slightly different from the ordinary interior of the country: only ceilings are beautiful, - historical -
The ceiling, however, is flowing regularly.
Sophia speaks of her apartment normally and amazingly at the same time as an Italian whose home is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was held some 40 years ago during the last repairs.
Then they made us a little kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the old one heard.
We live just where Damid and his family had been, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, is it?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, privatization is not important.
We're still only getting a one-room apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago we were promised to settle down, but the promise went on.
I'm not used to complaining, nor will I.
My grandparents, my mom and Dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter lived in this apartment.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flyer, they're three feet thick!
They say the solution has been mixed on the eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Damidov!
It's probably the only reason that no one has been killed by a broken ceiling or by their own.
It's only that the building is slowly dying in front of us, that the planks and the log of the house are rotting, that the floors have collapsed, that we've filled with cement, but it's all useless -- the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is, under our room, a hidden eye, and a walk towards the River Bela, who specifically made the old men living here, so that they could escape danger if they did.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Starstone tells us how some historian came to them, begged them to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then I tried to give them a living space in exchange for my one-on-one tour of Oct.
Sophia's story is,
Where are we four times one?
At least there's a real hope here that it'll make the shelter more easy.
Let's just agree to the exchange. Nothing would win.
The Old Age family, though, won't win.
Ludmile's greatest dream to be settled, and a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter gave them a separate room.
That is, two families were given a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins that two generations of people now live in.
A sympathetic, miniature girl named Olésa Karsakova from flats Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, there are two close rooms with a total of 23 m2 named apartments and a large family.
We're seven people, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
Like window frames, the storks fall off in the kitchen walls and in the rooms.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
As you walk through the apartments of the oldest Ufa home, you can make sure that the more you have been luckyd by Lavrentjev's spouses from apartment No. 4.
They're taking over the most spaced rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of space!
75 square housing, three people prescribed.
We live in just those rooms where Suvorov had been staying in Ufu, says the head of the Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentev family.
The ceilings are high, spaced.
One thing is, everything around the seams is breaking, breaking, breaking.
The neighbors must have already told you!
Most of all, we had our torment with our floors: wooden planks rotted, the ground literally left under our feet.
I put the backs, the wedges; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we walk like a duck on a swing, so all of it is.
A merchant named Eudokim Damidov's house, Alexander Dmitrievic, can tell you better than any guide.
The gold industry is viewed as a native, and it's a fascinating story.
Indeed, the owner of the Kaginsk and the Uyanian factories built houses, threw out guns and bellows, and held Ural mines.
The heirs to the shopping estate are proud of their ancestors, but they do not want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrijevic.
Then there were wooden structures for carriages, stables, and caraul booths, which were subsequently removed.
We wanted to clean up our house in 1968, but something happened.
The story was repeated in 2014: New housing was once again lured.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, wasted the necessary facilities, and suddenly learned that moving to apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants didn't take the tenant.
They sent from one table to another, and then, like a mock, they issued a paper without a signature and the press: \"The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of tenants.\"
I even felt that our home had long since been out of town because it was under number 57 first, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it's been ruined in the 1970s.
The Russian planet sought the lead sector of land information and analysis from the Ufa Vladimir Barabashu.
The October Revolution house 57/1 is included in the rest of the residential settlement programme.
I can't be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents are soon about to be resettled into new apartments.
According to Barabas, the restoration of the House of Damid would be an Italian specialist who had participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Italy is now hosting an architectural binnale, and the Old Ufa project is being presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire old Old Kazan Street will be restored, the official says.
Houses will be properly suited to the one before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all who want it.
At the government level, it was also decided that the street should be made on pedestrian weekends.
Unfortunately, there will be too much traffic congestion in the city.
Dissolve people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied with the new apartments being the same area as the current one.
It's only from another era.
In the Coast because of the storm, a forest fire broke out.
A dry storm caused a forest fire in the area of the Ostitudinal off-forestry in the Pharisa region of the Primor Region.
A grouping of forces and funds is being built up at the fire site.
According to the CSG-Primor Aviation Base management, conditions created at the fire site require the air force to be engaged.
Vassili Medvedev, Deputy Air Base Chief:
A fire in a difficult area was found by an observer aircraft on board an An-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood remains on an old burner.
The strongness of the area and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of landing sites that are suitable for fire extinguishers, pose significant difficulties in carnage.
We need a MI-8 helicopter.
The deployment of forces at the disposal of the Mi-2 helicopter and the AN-2 aircraft was severely hampered.
Four parachutist firefighters were promptly removed after the fire was found at the scene of the fighting.
The main task of the specialists is firefighting and the preparation of a site for the delivery of additional forces and firefighting equipment.
In the lunch area, 3 firefighters were further transported to the area of the village of Ohotnić by helicopter.
Once the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the experts will be moved to the fighting site, reported on the website of the Coastal Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I've never said, \"I love you.\"
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrant families from Jamaica to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, was working in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is practicing comedy, \"Rudi's red plates, which is partly based on his father's supposed conversations and grew out of the Radio 4 transmissions.
Sundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the tunes are life-rich.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult memories of his childhood.
After his mother’s death, treatment was a lot, and Henry often meditates on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, but you just heard his voice say, \"Do make noise.
Get off your sister.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown-up when I was a child, walked with him in a pub and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a kick in a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unscathing guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a cast shop in Dudley, and although conditions got better than those of his father, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, the depths of the labyrinths pre-eminent with flashes of fire and smoke and a pile of soot.
My father just got in the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself, because he wanted to clean himself up.
When I came there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn a living for us, and I began to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said: “I love you.
Only when Mom became ill at the very end of her life did we begin to say, \"I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
You can stop it - I love you -
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, and he's been married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, \"You need to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious exercise program, and I also had to go to a severe diet to get rid of my symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry’s career path is perhaps reflected in his noble, short - cut beard.
Ever since he received a confession of critics for his Hotel, he was totally immersed in the theater.
Comedy's wrong followed, then Ogasta Wilson.
This work is different from sitscomos and comedies, which have been an integral part of his productive life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didier noticed how he breeds on the stage, and wrote about him to the New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies: ‘ For a long time I was the only black breeder/communist on television -
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke machine between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in the New Deal in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Red and White minstrels show, a simple entertainment program in which people blackened their face -- Henry discovered that he had been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it much.
I kind of want it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although this was a strange, condemnable position, I worked on large sites and learned how to work with the crowd.
But what was the reward of an easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years - was also a grotesque parody on black people -
In presenting the characters who were mocking the black culture in the United Kingdom and who succeeded, Henry worked on an alternate comedy project in the eighties.
The first season, the Lenny Henry Show, was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties it was known as, inter alia, Chef Geret Blacklock's chef from the comedy series.
Advertising videos, documentary films, television series and movie role took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC show \"LennyHenry.tv,\" he thought, \"What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're taking time or turning around quietly\"
And then there was a series of Radio 4 documentary broadcasts called \"What's Good at... \"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergies on Shakespeare.
You can't tell me to teach this to a lot at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white people in middle class with cobblers and cabbages at the bottom of the front.
So I was really afraid of him.
All the interviewers we interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said: “You have to try.
Don't fight it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words aloud, and you'll see why we're all so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry read 20 lines from the last hotel monologue for documentary transmission, and he was capped.
I feel like I can do it.
Somehow my head was fixed.
- That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read that play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Errors--
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, \"Oh, you've changed.
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
“ A quiet voice inside me said, ‘ You'll have to work 10 minutes while they run a computer. ’
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and said to me, \"Wow, thank God!
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with this.
- You play the play, stay in the role. -
Henry's at the Dachez Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
Panic's quite useful, it's strengthening the musculature.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign above showing: \"That's what you need to do.\"
He's saying that, of course, in a BLOOD voice.
So I hold on to it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the comic's thinking -- all the way through our conversation, the flashes of his humor as he starts to breed.
I just decided not to work in the stenda because this thing with an instant pay from a full room of strangers, I think, is dangerous enough.
If you're always trying to do this, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Air Farm - when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he's gonna give him the standap tour someday.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director to help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road -- I don't think I'll ever want to give up that.
So this is his new creation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify invisible workers -
Kenya began the biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove invisible workers from the Government's payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniat promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700000) per month was lost through payments to invisible workers and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited in bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusyri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to appear within the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without good reason will be excluded from the statement of payment, reported therein.
“This procedure will significantly facilitate the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of government — hence, the problem of invisible workers — said Anne Weighour, secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structured Power.
Dozens of Turkish police were arrested in connection with a conspiracy against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of conspiracy against the Government, reporting to local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 senior officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them participated in anti-corruption activities last December, which were aimed at checking Government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) identified them as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in much of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a great occasion for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yazenijuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the awaiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, the great single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, the director of the Slavic school that Yazenukah's daughter went to, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
Rona Fairhead BBC may have found the most impressive leader she needs
It is followed by a plume of fame from the world of banking, media and the Tori Party ' s domestic circles.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at the global management firm at Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the Pearsons media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a lower-ranking male partner in the main company, Pearson's.
They say her salary is approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former BP head, when he tried to bring experts from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a Cabinet Adviser.
Her husband is former adviser to Tori.
Previously in May, I named the president of the poisonous cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of social life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two dimensions: inside is the upper level of the management hierarchy of BBC itself, but also outside is the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopololia, which requires complete radical reform.
However, which new president would risk coming to terms with the disintegration and destruction of the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a hard decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see BBC falling in size, once its authority, finance and status had been reviewed.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge the cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of licences pose a particular threat to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British have become a share of the world's greatest media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it says that its work covers 96 per cent of households and costs each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is clearly increasing: 53 per cent today supports it as opposed to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC browsing and use models have changed: now I get the news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missing software on an iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an inspirational president. I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside.
The tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas Republican R. Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of the district attorney from the Democrats, who is at the centre of criminal proceedings for the charge of abuse of power.
The Tweet was later removed, followed by another from Perry's account, which contained the recording.
A tweet was just published from my account, which was written by someone outside.
- I don't approve of that tweet, and I took it off, and I reported a later recording.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the communications with a request for comment.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually involved in publishing the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an inhospitable cartoon against the prosecutor of Travis Rosemery Lemberg, who found himself guilty of driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, resulting in a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The Tweet signature states: “I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the blood level of alcohol,... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it...
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
He was a Special Prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the accusations a political trick.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, claiming that the law used to prosecute the Governor who performed his duties longer than anyone in the history of Texas was vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state of the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County, and pursues corruption in the public sector in Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto made a formal complaint on the part of a left-wing public control group.
The tape of a confirmed Perry account is often updated, and sometimes becomes famous.
When he came to the fifth party meeting in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to the rumours that he could quit the game by tweeting a picture of himself running next to the lake and saying, \"Here we are, South Carolina.\"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal --
One of London's most famous builders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England was going back to its normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of lively demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would encourage Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley elite construction company, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to the normal level of peak 2013 transactions - adding that it is a stable working environment -
The London real estate market was overrun as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city’s prices jumped 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Census, significantly pummeling the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student-based Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London ' s real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “hospital tax” - before general elections in the next May.
The Foxtons Real Estate Agency of London warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth for both real estate and price sales in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its 2015 forecast for prices of London real estate to 3 per cent, based on the fact that the real estate price trend has already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell a quarter of the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital proved to be very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piedgley added: \"Request for the right good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have been kept for a period of time \" .
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year to the end of April, almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual tax return rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, an income of 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that Berkeley ' s estimated revenues during the year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a total of £450 million is expected to come within one year before paying taxes.
The value of Berkeley's shares was £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Exchange.
Photos of the naked Jennifer Lawrence, published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photographs of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were released on the Internet by a hacker who believes that he had a catalog — pictures of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Hunger Games confirmed that the pictures of Lawrence were valid and condemned the hacker for “a sudden invasion of his personal space” -
Law enforcement agencies have been contacted and will be prosecuted by anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing site of 4chan are said to have been obtained from the lack of Apple iCloud's online storage system, and the alleged victim's catalog includes the names of dozen women celebrities, including Ryanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these pictures are real, although the star Scotta Pilgrims Against All - Winstead in Twitter has also condemned the takeover.
“ Whoever looks at the pictures we took with my husband a few years ago, and I hope you’re proud of yourself, ” wrote Winston on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, of the Nickolodeon-iCarly series and Victoria-winner, refuted that she, in the photos, wrote on Twitter: \"These so-called pictures of I'm FALCHIVIKY, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Bouzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of Ariana Grande's pop star denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be real.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel of love and letter-J-representing critics' praises.
They dissolved, and the best thing to say is this, they gradually collapsed, like a box of paper left under the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, too tense, too closed, and perhaps a bit irritated.
Then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was as thorny as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this barrage was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual to be spared a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some pleasure.
Eileen Solomons was a fragile beauty with blundered hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion who was older than herself, whom Kevern thought her aunts were, with the latter inheriting a house in a crude but paradise-like valley called the Rai Valley -
No one lived in the house for several years.
Tubes were flowing, spiderlings were sitting in the baths, slippers left their footprints on all windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was covered with weeds like giant cobblestones.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, while a scary and charming one with a secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel J, was included in Booker's Long Letter in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen sat by hand in broken hesslongs among the tall grass, enjoying suddenly warm springtime; both scatteredly joined in a cheap console that provided dying music and soothing news to the country, when, looking at its brimstone feet, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer, whom he loved to listen to his father, dropped curtains in the house.
You're too big a leg.
Because of their aggressiveness, songs of this type on console were no longer lost.
They were not banned - nothing was forbidden in their own right - they were no longer lost.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word “archotic ” itself.
The public taste was what would never have been possible by order and order, and just as among the books people chose rich memoirs grown in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they chose ballads from all music.
On this day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and with a rough comical voice singing the big legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
- It was a popular jazz piano song, called Fets Waller, and he told her, mechanically, he put two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter J before she got off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played with his father as he told him.
Start the c-J word by forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and that'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation was out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's just the same thing with the horrors.
His unpredictability worked against people's nerves.
And jazz was a knuckle, expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Mladsch, Kever knew about jazz from his father's semi-secretal compact disc collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fets Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The community was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with gratitude - thanks to those that had saved their destiny - with the principle of group preponderance.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports, and they sang and fled.
As if naturalists were talented in everything about electronics, no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was used as a sanitary work; what remained of the Greek was a plate.
Out of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when the WHO that PROSEMS did happen, feared that they would be accused of inflaming the flames, feared that the flames would swallow them with the following, opened restaurants with looses and hookers, and kept themselves out of the abyss.
Each one's capable.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just missed could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
- They're not really offensive.
Unless maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the garden that was running gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproof isolation of giant leaves that resemble cabbage leaves.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to push two fingers again.
She already thought he was weird.
He thought it was funny, he said instead.
She was incredulously shaking her head, closing Kevern's view.
In general, there was nothing but a cop of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
- Well, if you say so, she said, staying with her opinion.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Thieves, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, \"I love you, but it was too early for that.
- I like you because your ankles are thick, and I tried to tell him instead.
I have this perversion.
That was wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the brutality in the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons dyed and got up from the hezlong, throwing down the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
The wine was from the bush, so intoxication could not be used to justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
- And I like you because you have a stupid head - she said...
You don't like it though.
He was sorry for her and for the rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she looked like an outsider in the top line.
The same huge ice ocean struck them both.
The same men who have been beaten, even more sensitive and clumsy after the one who has been tried, who are more likely than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, have been bred into rage from pubs into pubs, willing to raise their hand to any woman who has dared to deny them or to instigate them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the opposite of a fresh ballad that the console gave is to kiss it and then hit it.
For further details, in Ceverne’s view, since kissing yourself was already blasphemous.
Eileen Solomons, by means of his body, showed him he had to leave.
He came up out of the scheslong like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who let himself go.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought her.
She felt a sense of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hand on her.
A man who had turned away from her, with her back bent, stooped, struggling, and all her ability to fight, left him-- why did she think she knew it so well, if she couldn't remember any of the cases, until today, when she saw it?
Again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or near that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Ofnau Informal Public Control Service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country that expected it to decline if not stop at all, taking into account the funds and forces allocated to its eradication.
Much has been done, and much has been done -- it has written -- to mitigate the innate aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these sidelined branches and narrow settlements of the area, where, despite the puny churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, are found to be unexplored.
The higher the pin, the lower the passions it produces.
The population sheds tears on sentimental ballads, swallows stories of obstacles that have been overcome and proclaims its dusty belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does old roughness keep its tight grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and vicious bullying is taking place in homes, workplaces, roads and even in playgrounds.
- You've got a bad habit of writing too much.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I should also ask you, Are you an atheist?
- I don't think I have to answer - Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Again, silence.
♪ I ask ♪ ♪ finally said Luther Rabinitz ♪ Not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism ♪
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some of the hyperperceptions that are perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves can sometimes distort results, like what you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call \"evil\" and \"smelling\" others would be interpreted as expressions of natural love and energy.
To continue to be bored about the body that was set in motion, as if it had happened, if at all, yesterday, would have to deprive the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz spoke.
At his head, pink, like the flamingo, the LEDic letters repeated the advice that the Ophnau gave to the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, a word of song better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
- I fully understand what you're going to say - quietly Esme Nussbaum said when she made sure that her scientist had finished saying, - and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to the one that happened to be able to do so.
It's only this time that we throw our anger and distrust at no one else.
Luther Rabinitz linked the tips of his fingers into pyramids.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
'You're going too far,' he said, 'calling wrongs is the actions that our grandfathers committed or did not commit.'
You go too far and when you tell them they throw their anger and mistrust at others
In your place, a person should not need to remind him that by understanding the past, that is, by defending the real, we do not speak of us, nor of them.
There was no one, no one, no one, no one.
It was a time of unrest -- that's all we know.
“ For which, if you are honest with yourself, you dare to insert Esma, no part of society can do well to justify itself.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what's done is done.
Then it was.
Nothing else to say is here we agree.
And as no one should be blamed, no excuse should be made if that were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not for the purpose of learning,
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I can add one word to this--
Luther Rabinica's pyramid collapsed.
- I'll take a look at your report, he said, leaving her alone.
The next day, on the way to work, she was knocked down by a motorcycle who went to the pavement, as the passersby described, in a vicious rage,
It's a coincidence.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army countered the fact that a coup had been prepared to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied Government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming to have been threatened with attempted suicide.
Major Ntlelelej Ntoi, an army representative, stated that there was no coup, in fact, but that the army was reacting to a threat from the political fanatics whom the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by receiving several intelligences that there were some elements among the police that were really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to bring about chaos,” he told the American Voice.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjela, said that the army looked like a coup.
“Although no claim has been made to take power by force, it is reported that the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces at present have the main features of the coup” he said.
Lesotho's army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motyo Metsing is in charge of the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its joint Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite accusations of the contrary.

Eurozone production at lowest 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Eurozone production sector PMI index fell to the 50.7 mark in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by increasing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) Assembly on Thursday.
Markets will await a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with a halt to the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the risk of inflation deflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the ECB leader Mario Dragi would give further signals later this week that he was considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
“Although growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Market.
The German manufacturing sector PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy in the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a cause for concern, as does Italy's weakening of steady growth to stagnation.
The recognition that the momentum of growth has faded mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, and Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence, said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of industry is likely to further the oil supply to analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI had grown to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist of IHS Global Insight, said: “It is best to say about the August study of the Eurozone production sector business index, which shows that the sector is still growing —
He added: “The manufacturers of the eurozone are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially with Russia/Ukraine - is adding uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension seems to have hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “more and more like — that the ECB will, of course, have to carry out some type of quantitative mitigation, although we suspect it will be limited —
Mariupola residents will set up a live chain against the militia.
In Mariupola, before last week, there was peace. No one was in trouble to organize the people's republic of Mariupola, and the city on the Azov Sea was living and working.
Now the inhabitants are horribly awaiting the arrival of the militia --
According to political scientists, the separatists break into Mariupola to reach the Azov Sea, a town of Novozovsk, which had not been part of the self-proclaimed republics, had recently been taken.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army would defend them, but that it had a little force against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and they were going to help the military.
They're building trenches, building blocks, building reinforcements.
On Saturday evening several thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and stood there in a live chain singing a hymn to Ukraine.
They're going to do the same if they come.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and products, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, and banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten Years of Hell for the Survivors of Beslan: Ten Years of the school’s horrifying takeover as children who have fallen into it are still suffering
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the school massacre.
Exactly ten years after the terrible takeover of a school in Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children who had survived the catastrophe warned of a new apocalypsis in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in a perplexity, which in an amazing way turned into a future in the midst of the worst of distress.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during a school massacre.
We have found some amazing young people who have resisted the scourge, even though the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now threatens Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now stop.
The girl who's in the picture trying to get back to the blazing sports hall.
She's seen in a picture of the famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belyakov, when she was trying to get back to the fire-fighting gym after the mine exploded.
Disgustingly, Aida was looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
The woman told me to run with all her energy, but I couldn't -- she said, \"Aida.\"
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked it up and took it to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
Several pieces are left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the same way that doctors helped her.
That tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it, she says the challenge.
- It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remind everyone who's staying there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it the other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Déré Hapojev was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
- I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says that the capture remains with her, although memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world will still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and elsewhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I lie in a school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make it no more.
A boy who ran through a hail bullet, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of excitement by hugging their mother, Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, \"Mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, \"Be on your way.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said: “Damir told me his mother died.
He said, \"I couldn't save her.
In fact, Tamara left for freedom and was in a hospital with foot injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said: “I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damira later arrived in London (now the non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protector by the Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
- This horror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it, he said yesterday.
I can still say that I remember him.
I remember when I threw all my toy weapons away.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
- I'm not afraid of going back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember those kids I was playing in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted, and drive in an open car.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“ I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who had been working as a volunteer in a women’s convent last week.
I want to help.
I would like to serve at the police station someday and hope that I will be admitted to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48 years old, said: “37 children were murdered in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were no children screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understood when people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, and they can support us.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a boar, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing waitress at the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I think this world hasn’t been better than this 10 years.
There is now war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and calm boy, and he's not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, but he's not getting caught up in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it, and I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing out all his weapons and all his other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and I got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw all around me, as the parts were everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
- I remember shouting to him, \"Damir, run, run, but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
That is how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after capture became the defining factor for the Beslan tragedy
Room: Survivor of Beslan George Ilyin and his mother Fatima after his capture in 2004 and George's case today
His bloody face was filled with fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, was 54 years old, the principal physician, took him to school on the first day of school before he took his eldest son, Vladimir, to the university.
I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days a nightmare, she remembers.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer it is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falling into the soul: George (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was perpetuated in sculpture (right)
I remember George so much wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's a sculpture of crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's hidden in the book closet at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says: “It’s important that it never happen again.
- I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
They are now investigating this Boing collapse in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is going through something very bad.
- I can't understand how it's happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it's happening?
Ten years is nothing for such a pain.
We need to go through decades to forget her a little bit.
She's affected my health, and I still feel her.
About three or four years old, I dreamt of nightmares because of the takeover, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was really scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were murdered.
That's why I'm still going to this gym before every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical university in Vladikavkákákákák.
I'll study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't permit me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Incredibly, George Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the capture, but he survived.
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a terrorist killer's foot bomb.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
\"We think it was yesterday\" says George, who wanted to study for an FSB intelligence officer, but was unable to do so because of the damage his health suffered during his capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids can easily cope with bad things, and I have to say it's not true.
In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I'd never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev, a laptop-open photograph of himself in the hospital after taking over
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but now I'm walking fine.
But still, my health prevented me from going to FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all the animals, from the cat to the cows.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what children should know, and of course it's not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't.
She must be stronger to him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned to me, and here in Beslan every single one of you will find his fingerprints.
He's staying with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something that is so terriblely unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a couple of operations, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent overcome this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I will never forget the heart out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alain Tskaeva, 10 years old
A young man who had been taken to a safe place by a special suitor
Saved: Helena Tskaev is carried to a safe place by the Russian fighter Svetnaza (left).
She's ten now, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman brought Alano in his arms from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahar in the gymnasium.
The mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alonina’s mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has since married again, and with his new wife, Svetlana, there is a little daughter he called Christine a memory of a daughter he lost.
Alona, now ten, remembers nothing about being captured and has turned into a smart and happy girl, neighbors say.
- They're a very happy family now, and Aleona and Mahar are both beautiful children, and they're a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep them away from all memories when he's the tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Half-protector Sinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund, Borousia, noted that he looked forward to his return to the German club-shaped field.
He said that this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for Borousia again - it brings Kagawa's words to Bild.
I feel very good.
I'm full of positive emotions, and I'm looking forward to being back on the field in the form of the Borousia.
Recall that Kagawa moved to MJ, Borousia, in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to get into an English club with only 38 matches in the English Champion in two seasons, killing 6 balls and giving 8 performance gears.
The man is charged with riding a girl on the pedestrian crossing to Faifa
A 78-year-old man will be tried on charges of driving a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing to Faifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked off a girl on a crossing to Pittenwin in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart led his Audi Q3 without due caution and attention and knocked down the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Abstracter, denied his guilt in the Dundee sheriff's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, set a date for the trial on January.
Obama, Merkel, and Olland do not retreat to Vladivostok
The Duty Free Airport Trade Shop of Vladivostok has drawn up a sign prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders at the store.
And do not turn away from them with spirits, with vodka, and with horses.
The U.S. administration decided that President Barack Obama, chancellor of FWG Angel Merkel, French President François Olland, Vitali Klichko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known companions would not be able to ward off the water, horse and spirits at their store.
And I put a plate on the door.
Obama had previously received a ban on entering an even less accessible facility, the Dietary Standard IPF, as reported by the general care facilities website.
Whether the American president ever had the dream of eating in a dietary dining room in Russia is not known, but the banists clearly seem to be horrified by themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo?
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that, under the embargo, Russian agrarians should adopt new technologies in order to produce the raw materials they buy.
The Board was provided during a visit to a South-Ptyphernaire firm - Agrocomplex -
The head of Government also advised the restaurant to refocus on Russian meat, whose quality is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
Valentin Maslakov, the main trainer of the Russian assembly, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given that there is no focused preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have spoken at their own level, and it brings all the sports to Maslacov's words.
The third is confirmation of our high-level command.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We need to keep in mind that we weren't preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not obliged our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have a new collection.
On the contrary, the French exhibited a combat team that included 13 champions of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they have announced on numerous occasions.
But even this group of contestants couldn't stand up to the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were lower than those in the same Brilliant League.
The season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer the most important result, much more so in team competitions.
The main place was here.
And as a result, it's been absurd when men were so involved with the tactical crafts of running at 1,500 metres, that they showed the outcome below the average level of women's running.
4 hints on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or film the video under water, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight mill, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are closed.
Also set up your camera for the type of photo or video you will take.
Some photo and video cameras have modes of photography or object type that optimize the exposure for eclipsed underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 feet or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's manual and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off some of the personnel, because many of them won't.
Mills have JCDs that will help you put the pictures together, whereas action cameras don't normally have them.
Even if you have a JCD, it's hard to see it under water, and the human frame is a random process.
So do some of your work.
Also, if your camera has a serial survey mode that takes out a few personnel with slightly different exposure installations, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced than you dive deep under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more color in your photographs; the more deeply you leave, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the survey facilities.
It's a great land survey board, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
This is especially important if you are filming an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angled lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the survey facilities if you want to fill the footage.
The 2012 Olympic Games bronze prize for the Free Fight, Billal Mahov, can become a Greco-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sajid Sajidov, chief trainer of the Dagestan assembly in the Voltage Fight.
A specialist did not exclude an athlete from the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Billal Mahov is currently at the gathering of the Klassikov team - p-Sport - the words of Sajid Sajidov.
Actually, Bill's juniors were also performing in both styles.
At the 2005 youth beginning of the world, he was the winner of the Volcanoe Tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on the Volcano struggle.
It has been a long time since the conversation that the new stage of our career will lead to our hard work in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I'm going to say more: Mahov can already speak at the World Cup in Tashkent, if he wins the prize.
But the big word is always behind a training staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personality power could shake around, even in a giant organization such as the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to rid the sick of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were involved in diagnoses and diseases, those receiving treatment were mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
- I didn't feel as usual - he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Combating flulike symptoms, he found that he was excruciating his wife, Juliet.
- I want things to happen faster than later.
When Juliet left for the week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results.
It was mesothelioma, incurable cancer that affects the pleur, or lung cancer.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But it's different with mesothelioma.
Almost all of the time, the reason is that you have assemblage with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a miracle, but it's now known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestet, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the Industrial Guidance Ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it, such as pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly sees cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here, mesothelioma is killing more people than any other country on the planet.
At the annual mortality rate of some 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesotheliomas usually go away for decades.
And to attack mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestet was, and in many cases remains, a house where we live, offices where we work, schools where we study, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, wealth, profession or age.
The elections, from fashionable London University to private schools, did not seem to be saved.
Parliament's building has been pierced by asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tubeproofer.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get in touch with asbestos.
Then he made it.
- There may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaja Hospital, where I spent six years in internships, he wrote.
Everyone -- students, nurses, doctors and trucks -- used these tolls.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question to which, unfortunately, he could provide a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who had interns at Gaia’s hospital and who had subsequently developed a mesothelioma over the past five years, he noted in a letter in 2010, one remaining alive —
How many of us are going to get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live.
Fifty percent of those with mesothelioma die eight months after the diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: \"How many of us are going to get sick with this same disease.\"
According to Britain’s mesothelioma lead expert, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain must survive, it will kill about 9,000 people.
Most now do not believe that they will die in this way.

A quick look at reports from the courtrooms where victims often seek compensation shows how far the mesothelioma has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that he had been seen by Dennis Ellen asbesto.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing department at two sites, one of which was a major store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over 20.
“ Before that happened,” she says, “I never heard of a mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't believe I was going to be affected.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They are named after the word \"asbestiform \" , which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of those six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, in bulk tiles, in thermal insulation of pipes, in leather stitches, even in car brake wells.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a major source of health damage that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amposite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of the world’s brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are substantial, albeit circumstantial, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain] -
Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the company’s main store at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito’s work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of mesotheliers, when no known effect on work or at home, were likely to be caused by the effects of asbestos from the environment -
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the -- the conventional use and effects of weather -- on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, in which Westminster Palace was considered, demonstrates how people, even at the heart of the Government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could have been driven by something as harmless as strong airflows -
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems right to the contrary.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Services Directive insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a clean sanitary certificate, it now recognized that £1 billion needed to be worked on the reconstruction of Parliament by upgrading electricity and removing asbestos and that, following the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre nearby rather than at the Westminster green benches.
The report by Goddard noted that “the asbestos situation was not administered in accordance with the various rules”
It is impossible to know if this control error will cost your life.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, aged 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“ I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos, ” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places that worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, it's the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was at the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I started to get angry.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from a pleural around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Tasked doctors made X-ray images of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it to the testers.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had been exercising and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in an admission with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not relate it to his own experience.
Finally, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The relationship was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and the consulting doctor showed his results to the CT and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going, he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, frankly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: \"I was told it was a mesothelioma.\"
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott got into a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That was when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma now strikes younger people with unusual professions.
The most dangerous pipes isolated by asbestos in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
However, many staff members who had walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basements (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
Within a few decades of the war, it turns out, the hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for their patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
School students set their Bunsen burners on asbestos grounds
And these are not just hospitals.
Asbest has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and mayors because of their amazing isolation and fireproof characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely to be exposed to asbestos in class for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren set their Bunsen burners on asbestos grounds.
Websites have come up to raise awareness of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things, such as tile or shed roofs, tended to contain asbestos.
- It's an industrial poison planted in a huge number of our structures, and he notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Gaius's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful about going down the garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is ogromen.
- For knowing it, it's been quite a while, says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and figure out what I was doing.
Well, I'm not gonna see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was to change from a doctor to a patient.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to accept.
- It was hard to understand, he said.
♪ I asked my doctor ♪ How much time I had ♪
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, ‘ Well, I’m not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's all.
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanic of how we support life, the act of breathing itself, that causes cancer, which kills.
Most mesotheliomas are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers inhaled, they can be stuck in a pleural, a lining of the lungs.
asbestos fibers irritate the pleural and may cause cell mutations.
The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers -- Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaius Hospital in 2001.
It's that hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now is the irony of fate, leading the mesothelioma treatment center.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed while in hospital.
When asbestos needles fall into the tissues of the lungs, Treger says, by breathing, they are pushed to the periphery where the lining is located.
It's essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment for other forms of cancer is much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical interventions, for example, creates heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth trying.
Treger doesn't agree.
- You can't cut the plevre - he says.
It's impossible to get a knife around her.
However, this cancer is not very good at chemotherapy - which works - but does not cure it.
\"Sometimes there's a patient who's been living a long time.\" Treger says.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Professor Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was made.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had a mesothelioma, Abbottto was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, alone became a support and counselling office for the same patients.
- Allo, Cancer Central, it's a life of joy that he said when they called.
- He was very positive. - Says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbottto was offered six sessions of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for just a month.
- I was desperate, he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, nevertheless, was eager to give all a slightly more positive color --
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Langs-Lasdunski, professor of toxic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
- We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me, admittedly Graham.
The average patient would have to receive funding and support.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment finally fails, many patients face another financial cause for concern - the future of families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
- We've known asbestos is harmful to health since 1898, Morgan says.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it's become clear that very few people could be exposed to health risks.
That's when we talked about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Gaius Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a full-cost settlement, according to Morgan, since Lawson was unable to clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gaius Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the representative of Gaius Hospital confirmed, nevertheless, that “asbest in the basements in question had been removed in the 1990s -
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades later — proved to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma who needed compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that there is no time on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
This year's response has resulted in serious new legislation that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under this Act, a £350 million fund has been created for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who are not.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case, about £120000.
About 300 successful claims in this scheme are expected to take place every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a very good job for the insurance industry.
- It's a deal written by insurers for insurers - he says he expects that a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay had the time gap and the patients with the mesothelioma failed to track down the companies and file a suit normally.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was not perfect -
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
“ People are suffering so much, and they need help today, ” said Penning during Bill’s second reading of Mesotheliom last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Langs-Lazundski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Langs-Lazdunski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Langs-Lazdunski can boast as many as 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt the tide of strength.
- That's, of course, one of the most important things, says Abbott.
You see this with patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, your condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six chemistry cycles.
Subsequent scans did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of a tumor.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finance, when I die, for example, or if I have to show my wife how the timer works on the biller.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, age 16, and Temzin, age 14, it's not always easy.
- It's hard for a parent, he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Temzin is very obstinate and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to deal with.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a blundering possibility to survive.
This disease is associated with darkness (even, ultimately, with Stephen Jay Guld).
As Andrew Morgan says, mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for harm to health resulting from an asbestos contact in Great Britain.
World asbestos production is growing to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The UK Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All asbestos use is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in Hong Kong ' s business neighborhood, as activists have started planning and mobilizing within hours of the application.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress, in fact, enables communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“ This has not deceived our expectations, but it still makes us angry,” said Democratic Party legislator Emily Lau.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China ' s decision, Li Fei, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People ' s Congress of China, said that it would be far too chaotic to allow the popular election of the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Great Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to elect a head of Government by vote, beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the assistance of a commission to appoint candidates severely controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who - love the country and love Hong Kong - will be admitted.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
A major part of Hong Kong's Democratic campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to close the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing did not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement would move to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, evidently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement was only considering the possibility of taking over the central area as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We regret to report that, to date, all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the central area seized will no doubt be seized.
Public authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing for several days, and security measures involving police and barricades had been strengthened at Government headquarters on Sunday.
Disruptions are at the root of the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
The fear is also increasing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong's business force at risk.
- The protest they're talking about can cause a lot of economic damage depending on how long and how long it will be, said law-makers Regina Ip, who have been critical of the movement for a long time.
We don't want any concerns about Hong Kong getting out of hand.
It's a perception that's harmful to investment.
The Chinese public media have also reported in recent days in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown to be diversified by Western Powers.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 78,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American graduation culture goes to university life: first year students were invited to arrive on a personal plane
We are happy to respond to this demand by starting the first category - lux - service in Britain for current students.
To keep a vivid impression from arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin, or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The company representative reported that since the service had just started, no orders had yet been issued, but added that “students would start ordering the service in the next few weeks”
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay £9,000 per year, it still hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago with regard to expectations and expectations: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what is needed.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union criticized this service as being separate from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NSS for Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of most students.
Many students who will start a university course this month face a cost-of-living crisis where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rising cost of basic needs before they can even start thinking of taking thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival in a dormitories.
Feminists raise the question of race and conduct of the police after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The arrivals raise their hands by scanning, \"Rocks up, don't shoot, while they wait in line before the funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, of the murder of unarmed teenage Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed a shift in Internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left behind their comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women focusing on race 100 per cent.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with such headlines as Ferguson's thinking on the face of a white woman - and Feminism - are not just about oppressing women - they appear relatively late.
But for Pérez, they showed a significant shift.
In feminists, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin color and privileges at that high level, she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we've encountered, and because the situation in Ferguson is so deeply connected to race, they felt they needed to point to it.
For a professor of English at Ohio University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson has identified the problems black Americans face every day but which are not perceived as women's issues in the cultural sphere.
- I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 shits all over the place, Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colourful people are attacked in their own country, silence numbs.
“Why it is safe for women to talk about relations, but not about public safety,” she asks.
For black women, like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues related to race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattry, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lazy, and the rape of a white woman almost always served as a basis, ” Hetter explained.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story to justify laziness.
From Hetter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragers, for example Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would be effective for only one of the groups: women or blacks.
- They decided to put all the eggs in the basket for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why color women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against the lints in the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lings.
This group appeared nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell's view, the rise of white feminists to the problems raised in the situation in Ferguson, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists have had to overcome problems that black women have dealt with in several generations.
- It would be great if activists with such a [traditional feminist] ideology were to take the child’s right to be raised as they were to the right to contraception, - asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists, who made careers in reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A well-known white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article from the Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
- I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the racial perspective, which is significantly different in public polls - will be at the head of the change - wrote Stainham.
Although Stainem is charged for a more intersecting feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Entrepreneurial Institute, Christine Sommers, author of Kto stole feminism, said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially colourful young men, are much more vulnerable than their sisters -- but the Remarkers of Stein of Ferguson contradict the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “My brother has an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein, to help vulnerable black and Spanish - speaking youths.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem promoting the leading line of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escort at the country's south-west border this year, immigration reform came back to the surface - this time as a women's problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to raise the problem as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
- They speak for themselves, he said to Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
- Those stories find feedback from women's organizations, she says.
The Ipswich house with pigs is selling.
A picture of a house shown for sale in Saffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a big pig resting in a living room.
For sale for £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is on the private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was given by a photograph of a living room in which a pig was depicted with a sofa head.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo is the owner's home favorite.
One photo was placed by mistake and had already been removed - a representative of the company reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described a former assembly house as a “unique separate house with a single bedroom ”
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still in the advertising material.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social networks where some have asked whether pigs are sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round match US Open, says that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year and try to get to a new level, she hands over to Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you generally value your results on the larger helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won \"Rolan Garros\"
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the ends of some matches.
I am, of course, upset.
He couldn't even get to the fourth.
What challenges do you set before the end of the season?
After being hurt, I have a huge motivation to go to the new level.
I have work to do, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament show is starting in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Committee of the State for Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, the former World Cup, Nikolai Valuev, proposed that the TBT be given bonuses when it comes to higher education.
He said that, in general, the norms would be the same as in Soviet times, people would be giving up standards for stretching, running and other exercises.
It will be recalled that 12 Russian actors will start implementing TTO standards on their territory as of 1 September.
I also suggested that students who gave up TTO to give bonuses when they went to higher school, and Valuyev said.
For example, they might be able to add a little bit to the EGE.
There are also suggestions to provide additional weekend workers to businesses that have undergone sport tests.
There was a new millionaire in Harvey in South Wales after winning a lottery
He's a lottery player from Harvey this month.
There's a search for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where one lucky person will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The Harvey Newsstand brings gold to the first prize in five years, and the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be told of himself.
The owner of the bench, Steve Forward, said that he had won the prize in a small town to the south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about this, and everything is very excited.
We thought such a gain could be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated winning the prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, Canning Veil player became one of five million people in August, following a huge $7.5 million winning a pair from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and had told them that winning had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of Western Australian top prizes to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mineral development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, Mineconom development will introduce to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally sound transport in Russia, and told the Deputy Director of the Department of the Oleg Plujnikov on a round table held by Vedocities on Moscow Autosalon - 2014.
The plan had been commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September to the beginning of October, says Plujnikov, and the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids, a plan for the development of vehicles in the gas fuel industry in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy of knowledge) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for assessing electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and concessional leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the cost of machinery, stimulate localization and build service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
It is envisaged to amend regulations in 2014-2015 in order to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking spaces, auto-fuelling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in the course of 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally sound transport, in the form of an advantage for traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, and proposals for the expansion of the State procurement of such transport.
Finally, Mineconom development will, by October 2014, list the performance of regional authorities with criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally sound transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still being formed - in 2013 about 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, import duties for electric vehicles were lifted, so sales would be about 500, predicts the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
However, the five-fold growth does not make electric cars visible: in 2013, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia, according to the European Business Association.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors are imported into Russia.
Renault, a company focused primarily on corporate clients, says Renault, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicholas Remises.
Most other electric manufacturers, however, took a lifeline position against Russia.
There is also the development of electric vehicles by Russian manufacturers - - GAZ - - but it's a small issue.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Holdinga-AutoVAZ, 30 electric vehicles were released.
The question is low because of the cost of the electric vehicles, the director of AutoWAZ will admit to the engineering of Sergei Amanov, and there will be no breakthrough in this segment without the approval...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the cost of cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as internal combustion engines) inhibits the lack of development of the charging infrastructure (fuelway unit), and inspires the gender director-Autostata-Sergey Celikov.
Because of the cost savings and the low rate of lower cost, electric vehicles will remain the niche segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, forecast by the editor-in-chief-Avtoreu-Mihail Pocrojanski, and Celikov agrees with it.
On the contrary, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the value of conventional vehicles.
In Russia's electricity market, there are good prospects; in particular, consumer confidence that electricity is real; this will be facilitated by the emergence of all new charging stations, stresses Wolfgang Schlimme, President of the BMW group in Russia.
Such infrastructure projects are in the process of, for example, Rosseti, a company with several stations in Moscow, and about 80 more soon.
Negotiations on the construction of the network of fillings are ongoing with other regions.
According to the director of the department, Rossety-Vladimira Sofien, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are problems: few electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands of electric vehicles.
In addition, - Rosseti - as a network company is not entitled to the sale of electricity, is working out how to do so with regard to the charging of electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the dominance of the formation of an electric car market in Russia to be the paying off of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, and it will be possible to extend it, to expand the grace list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and for all machines) will also support the market, but it will not be as tangible as the Customs preferences, says Pankov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp rise in the sales of electric vehicles, which now account for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia there is also a need for incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of electric vehicles moving on assigned lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46, one-way, crashed into Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people in it are dead, handing over the ITAR-TASS.
Survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from the Denver airport airstrip.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In the Donetsk region, prisoners of battalion - Donbass -
The Karatians were surrounded by Ilovaysk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of militants were killed by gunfire.
Survivors say that if they knew what the situation in South-East Ukraine really was, they wouldn't have fought.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The battalion-Donbass sailors remained alive after the mesquite they fell under Ilowes.
In the vicinity of the army of the Donetska People ' s Republic, the militants spent several days in fact being abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the ring could be removed through the alleged corridor, the convoy moved.
But in just a few minutes, all sides were hit by shells and bullets.
♪ We were allowed to go out on the information we were given ♪ ♪ The deputy battalion commander with the back of the Laermont ♪
And when we went down the low between the Multi-Pole and the Red-Cernoselles, cross-fires began with anti-tank guided missiles, the Sussex grenades were 30-millimetre, the automatic BMD guns, small arms.
Four cars were ahead of me and three were behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
The inquisitive officer, Lermontov, says that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, and many died later.
Survivors are now receiving medical treatment from those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are amazed that so-called terrorists are treating them well, giving them food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to death.
We were betrayed simply, they say.
Colonna, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
In battalion-Donbass - like many of his companions, Alexey volunteered, for Ukrainian news stories told of atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east of the separatists -
Alexey saw a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar shelling going on, that most likely it was the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexey.
I then wanted to leave the battalion.
We weren't released from Ilovaysk, we were told we were in a ring.
I've already agreed with the commander. I've already written a report on the departure.
Zuracho and I were taken to Ilowesk immediately.
The prisoners said that 300-350 people were stuck under Ilovaysk.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would not enter the punitive battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to DNR forcemen.
Everyone is checked for war crimes.
Staff has been established in the region to limit food prices
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyar province, which will limit the rise in product prices in the market in the region, if necessary.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural production in the province.
The West of the Economy - Will Kiev - Rosnefti recover $140 million of the loss?
Chapter Rosnefti-Igor Sechin stated that the company was evaluating the damage caused by the shelling of the Lisican NHRI in Ukraine at $140 million.
That's what he said in Spiegel's interview.
“We estimate $140 million in damages and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation” said Sechin.
He said that the modernized company called Lisician NPP had planned to operate in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
- There was no fighting, there were no much-occurring rebels - but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of an industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil rolled in pipes was missing, he said.
Recall, on 18 July, a oil storage tank was burned and two warehouses destroyed in the shelling of the Lisikan NPP.
The Lysichanic NHRI, the main oil refinery in Ukraine, was first introduced in October 1976.
The total strength of the Lisikan NHRI is about 7 million tons of petroleum raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing the standard fuel - Euro-4 - as well as the fuel supply - Euro-5 -
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisikan NHRIs were suspended owing to their loss.
It was decided to start repairing the company.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisikan NPP along with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets.
The DPRK has launched a small range projectile towards the Japan Sea.
According to South Korean media, this happened about 10:30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, which is located on the North Korean and China border.
As reported by Interfax, in the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff, it is believed that the rocket fell into the Japan Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
Ruble falls amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 copies to 37.15 roubles, and the rouble was reduced to a bivalve basket amid geopolitical tension.
The dollar ETC sales started with transactions at the borders of 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1, an average of 37.16 roubles/$1, which is 4 copies above the level of the previous closure, in two minutes.
The euro rate was £48.79 for 1 euro, 3 copies above the level of the previous closure.
The price of the bin added 3.5 cops to 42.395 roubles.
The United States dollar trades 23 copies above the official rate, the euro 16 copies above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but panics were not observed this time.
It has continued to be cheap and ruby, and it has even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now pre-eminent in deteriorating geopolitical conditions and possible new sanctions for Russia.
But as long as it's more like artificial hysteria, it's spread out through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for new sanctions to be imposed on the RF are not much.
TeleTrade- At the opening of the Moscow rouble Exchange, there continues to be a sharp decline against the white basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
-Orenburg Airlines will be subject to an Ideal Tour -
“Orenburg Airlines” has launched an Ideal Tour for a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
There are two cases in which the meetings will be held in October.
There will be different judges to deal with the cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
His sum is just over 425 million roubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
A second statement was filed on 18 August.
His sum is 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union of the Turkish Industry, the judges of the case have been appointed in different cases.
In July, the media produced information on debts - ideal to pre-Orenburg Australia - amounting to 1.5 billion roubles.
The airline director, Victor Zukin, points to the sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
Hendor-Aerovolta-Vitaly Sawelev calls it an even bigger sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting to new users
Microblogging service has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have dropped their micro-bloggings.
New Twitter users will now view a large number of accounts recommended by the service at the time of registration so that they can immediately form a readership.
The recommendations are made on the basis of the information provided in the registration of interests.
Twitter automatically puts a subscription check on all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user will have to take his own hand-sets to avoid reading to those who don't.
If previously the users of the microblogging service saw only the recommended users' avatars, Twitter will now print out a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration over the past three years.
Recently, Twitter has been working hard to modernize the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the service's continuing efforts to achieve irreversibility.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a drop in the activity of readers.
At this point, the company desperately needs more loyal resources for consumers who, once in a while, would remain long.
Only by doing so can a steady flow of advertising be achieved.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be green and hot.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, reporting meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Pomoskovje it will be 13 and 18 degrees.
The cloudy weather will rain, and the east quarter wind will be quite weak, only 3 to 8 meters per second.
Car disposal programme resumed 1 September
Since 1 September, the car management programme has resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Minpromtorga RF, Denis Mantourov, explained, money is allocated from limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redeployment from other support lines.
The programme affects all vehicles over six years of age.
The compensation would range from 40,000 per passenger car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Previously, a similar car management programme had been in place in Russia.
The main difference between the current project and the Minister explained that it was not only intended that machines should be disposed of to obtain a subsequent adjustment, but that if the car was over six years of age, it would be possible to acquire a new car with a discount at the dealer's old-fashioned dealer's, Interfax,
The previous federal disposal programme, which was implemented from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, cost more than 16 billion roubles.
Thanks to it, passenger car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent in relation to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release the game on modern journalism
Gaimdisiner Nikki Case, famous for the game Coding Out Simulator, decided to release the game of modern journalism.
He described his project in a Kill Screen interview.
Case began working on the game a few weeks ago, but it is only now widely known.
The inspiration for the game was given to events in Ferguson, where the protests began after a police officer killed a unarmed black boy.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the narrative of stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population occur.
The hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which affects the course of events.
If he takes the scene off in a way that the police would look like heroes and the protestors would be bandits, the police would start to treat him better and let him go where the normal person could not go.
If he did not cover events, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into large-scale riots.
Points in the game will have to be dialed with the hero's tweet, where new subscribers will appear, if the photos presented there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it appears are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keys, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but that he originally wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting the game material, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on the basis of what happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
The most famous of his projects was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which talks about the events in Case's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to communicate his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletei drags Ukraine in the continuation of the bloodshed
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Valerie Geletia, has been calling to prepare for another or tens of thousands of victims in an ongoing bloodthirsty confrontation, referred to in the Ministry of the Russian Federation.
In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valerie Heletey, who declared that the operation to free Ukraine from terrorists -- and the beginning of the Great National War -- would incur losses of “ten thousand”
The degree of adequacy of the head of military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, a subject for the study of non-military experts, is stated in a communication from Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times, that if they continue to resist, they will use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that the “Operation Operation for the East of Ukraine” was completed.
Perz Hilton removed all the intimate pictures of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars were covered by horror.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords into iCloud in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the blog site of Perez Hilton's blogger.
True, not for long.
Recall that the official representative of the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, had already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and he had confirmed that all of the images that shine on the Network were real.
Per Hilton, the creator of the same-name tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her co-authors for publishing their frank images, writing The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I'm not contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice, who wrote a blogger in Twitter.
However, all the frank photographs of the stars have already spread over the Network.
David Beckham got into an accident hiding from Paparacy.
David Beckham got into a motorcycle accident, escapeing from the paparacy.
It happened in L.A. at the turn of the Sanset Bulvar.
A British football player separated by the perversion and stretching of his right hand.
Beckham got out of a dad's salon where he was waited for Paparacy.
Leathering from their motorcycle harassment, he failed in a direction with control and fell, writing TMZ with reference to close to football.
As a result, Beckham was struck, and the muscles of the right hand were stretched, and the scratches were scratched.
Tony Stuart endures the accident back to track
Tony Stewart's return to track is now slightly more than that of the Atlantic Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time his right front tire broke into 172 circles, putting the end of his performance.
Stuart got his fucking car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that the 14 team members were upset, but would now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
- I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better out there.
Stuart first swung into the wall earlier in the race the Sunday night after a clash with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of the right side of his car.
♪ I started today with a pretty high hope of getting to the finish line ♪ ♪ Johnston added, ♪ Just didn't work ♪
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded onto the evacuation vehicle, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a ground track race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either the Atlanta or the next Richmond races to take part in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident, which resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on track to complain to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three - time champions met with loud voices and applause when he was represented before the race.
Starting from position 12, Stuart went in position 1 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position 4.
Then you have 122 circles after you re-start the Bush number.
car 18 went off the trajectory at direction 2 exit and crashed into Stuart, pushed both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he got back to position 21.
Sobchak and Vitorgan are breakfasting cigarettes with Zwanets at Odessa
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, a thing that the TV teacher has not been able to tell about in his Instagram.
True, one photo is very surprised and upset the couple’s worshipers.
The picture is taken from Zwanetsk.
At breakfast, Michael Michaelić of Zwanetsk Maxim explains what an instagram is:) #odessa -- signed a photo of Xinya Sobchak.
However, there is nothing but cigarettes on the table.
No coffee, no buns, no oil, no more...
The couple decided that Ksenish too was smoking, and they condemned her for it.
- And whose cigarettes? - \"Curvy is killing.\" - Which one is a cigarette breakfast.\" - Like breakfast, and on the table, just cigarettes.) - - \"Kseniya, you too smoke\" - - excited for your favorite signer of her blog.
Not long ago, Sobchak boasted of the taste of dinner for the first time in her life, Max Vitorgan.
\"Happy is this when you arrive at your daughter's house, and your husband prepared dinner for your arrival, but it's delicious for the first time.
The picture shows that Maxime is preparing something with effort, and the table already has salts and chickens on it.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest action
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in Sofia ' s capital.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions that had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also included in the list of claims to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christ Ivanov.
During the month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison staff union met repeatedly with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The negotiations are ongoing and have informed the BNR of the Head of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Jealousy.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the Prison Workers ' Union.
The Army is in control of the new Government of Thailand
General Praiute (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defence, Provita Wongsuwana (left)
The military ruler and the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praiut Chan-Ocha, announced a new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, where more than one third of the positions are held by the generals or by the generals on resignation.
Key positions have been won by the army: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prait Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government.
A 60-year-old military officer who took power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the presidency.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Praieta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat ' s Government.
Officially, Prait Chan-Ocha will be the temporary prime, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to consolidate their power in the country.
The military took power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of civil power.
Leaders of major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested leading politicians in the country, including Prime Minister Yinglick Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis was rooted in 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglick Chinavat Taksin, Prime Minister.
They are both popular with the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has helped them more than once in the elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elites entered the anti-government movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said they'd be better off in the midi salad, I didn't promise you, they're looking for a waitress from the new Palm brassery.
We have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain unshakable.
Because everyone knows for a long time: we say Belgium means middies, we say Media - we mean Belgium -
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location and re-location.
There's places like this, not that good, but even great, but kind of unlucky.
In short, when I sat down outside Palm table, I remembered that there was once a Cafe City here, then Odessa Mom, and a restaurant called Bogoola, and a beer Friend,
Now it's drunk, but it's nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was located above the earth — a bar tower and a pair of tables, and the rest of the space is without even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like in a children's room: red, yellow, and green walls, multicolored chairs, instead of the windows of television, where the girl rosals swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so there is something to compare.
There are eight kinds of spilled beer (260-300 roubles for 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
A positive company presents the menu fun, saying that mussels are full-sized seedlings, and it should be noted that the service is the most positive side of Palm despite the individual shortcomings.
The menu is expected to be content, but often very sudden.
Well, to whom, for example, it's assumed that a roll of meat with a Walloon (280, roubles) was actually a carpach, cut in the same way so thin that the parchment paper compared to it would appear thick.
You can only feel some taste if you warm the pancakes together.
It's even worse with salads.
Classical Leysberg (260) is the most appropriate crime against the Belgian people: some kind of icy iceberg that's been torn away from a long time ago, a potato that's scattered the Kenyan beans, the Odrevenelle chips of bacon plus something marinated onions.
You don't want to see anyone with this ice salad!
The composition of the ingredients in the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If the dark side of the tomatoes was still open to the eyes, why would the mussels look as if they had been able to defrost and turn them off several times in their lives?
I already know that there's some nice white-collar mussels here!
They're served in the pans - in the sauce for your choice - (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
The half-pupil, white wine, herring, and carrots, did not give up in a frank manner.
Vegetables are present, and the aroma is missing, and the wine was there, and it remained a mystery.
But they're good lady-to-middle frits with home mayo.
The chicken's a waterpot here, not a hangover, thick to such a degree that you can decide, depending on your mood, first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice plump soup.
The rabbit was said to be a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the raspberries.
The situation was diametrically opposite at the turn of the check, with the raspberry numbing everything.
It seemed that the rabbit had been fed exclusively by the rosy bushes that had acquired such an unusual scent.
But at the same time, the rabbit's leg was a wonderful one -- no, just a red-headed pear in a caramelized short.
The waffles in Palm are not only sweet but also common with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came up to the table was very informally interested in lunchtime impressions.
So it's worth it to come again.
The dollar's course rose above 37 roubles on news of new sanctions for Russia being prepared by the West.
It's a new historical record.
The euro’s score - the tomorrow - by 10:29 pscow grew by 26.9 copies and stood at 37.02 roubles, and the euro’s rate rose by 30 copies, up to 48.73 roubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The bin grew by 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 roubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 roubles on 19 February 2009, and it was already 37.005 roubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angel Merkel were discussing the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rim is long-term, with a pair of euros and a couple with a dollar.
The long-term forecast included this mark, says senior analyst Alparía Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will one way or another be reflected in the course.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
The rumours of the incursions on either side have not been confirmed, but the market has become very emotional.
All of the talk that he was resistant to this kind of news came out yesterday.
The week is projected to be close at 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine is all a link to one chain.
Inflation is also forecasted, with 5 to 10 per cent added to current autumn prices.
In a short time, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be finished, and there will be a vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
- Dallar came to the point of 37 roubles, passed it and returned, some powerful hysteria, and comments to the head of the Market Analysis Division, discovery of Broker-Constantin Bushuev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday as NATO meets.
Ruble, he said, had been severely weakened after the end of the tax season, then went on news in Ukraine, and the CB said last week that by the end of the year, it had completely moved to a floating rate and had refused any exchange intervention.
If you look at the daytime patterns, it was nothing different from the previous ones this month, and everyone was scared by a mark of 37 roubles, the analyst continues.
And yes, nothing powerful happened in terms of trafficking.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I recall, when there was an increased demand for currency at the end of January, as well as for the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS ICs also see the positive side of weakening the rouble.
First of all, it is the growth in revenue from export operations, as well as the increased competitiveness of domestic producers through over-importation, says UFS Chief Analyst IC Alexey Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be detrimental.
Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, fueled inflationary pressures and resulted in more expensive borrowing, which in turn impeded the country ' s economy.
In the case of the stock market, depreciation of the rouble slightly reduces the drop in stock prices expressed in roubles.
For example, the MIB Index of Trades of Thursday fell by 1.67 per cent and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relative size of the index decline is attributable to a decrease in the ruby by more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the rouble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy currency.
Experience has shown that the emotions gradually go down and the roubles partially or completely recover the lost positions.
- We think we can see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency at 36 roubles per dollar soon. - Alexey Kozlov points out.
Genetic impairment is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.
She spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Mari-Tuta (SMT) disease, a group of hereditary disorders that resulted in damage to the nerve outside the brain and to the spinal cord.
CMT UK reported that misdiagnosing is a common problem among people with SMT, because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have SMT, which may cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, infidelity, and toes stinging.
The sick may experience ovulation or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that the symptoms become stronger over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from the Fridreich (AF) attack, a condition that was very bad for her.
Rogers thought she'd be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she turned 30.
The mother of the two children, now 51, said: “When I was a kid, I knew I couldn’t do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never ride rollers or skateboards with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because of how I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after a few operations to release the achilles' tendon and to straighten out her feet, she looked into the medical map when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had an AF.
- I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't go, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, I found information about the condition in the library, and I wrote to the AF Association, she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and had the worst panic as soon as I could.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and I'm going to lose all of my abilities in this space.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me, and said, \"My dear, I don't think you've got this disease, because you'd be in a wheelchair anymore.
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she was found by SMT.
When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket, she said.
The SMT Charitable Organization of the United Kingdom has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington area entrepreneurs is increasing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Public and local tax accounts for companies across the country have moderately increased in the past year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
District, Maryland and Virginia have paid $27.6 billion in total to the state and local treasury in financial 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the 2012 $26.6 billion.
The state and local business tax burden has increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after years of decline, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by the professional service company Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy team.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are on business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenues are on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the lowest tax revenue proportional to the business.
To a large extent, tax revenue increases were due to the return to the remaining value of the company ' s real estate, researchers say that they raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these incomes are from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington area.
District, Maryland and Virginia have paid $10 billion of real property taxes at both the state and local levels last year, $9.6 billion more than 2012 increases by 4.2 per cent compared with the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely more than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Centre.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent rise in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Business revenues also seem to be making an adjustment according to this data.
Companies in the region declared a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, $2.1 billion higher than 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate revenue from income tax, most notably in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of local entrepreneurs does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was substantially faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were rising below the average income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which had the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes for state and local entrepreneurs were lower and generally more favourable in terms of business taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its fiscal goals next year, the law could bring the income tax rate to business even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pay more taxes both at the state and local levels, according to a recent study.
Business taxes, paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners, a transition structure that is managed by most small firms in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, have grown by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than those for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that trends and increases in income from business taxes across the country are likely to persist this year, with state and local government sales taxes rising by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014, as compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may lag behind as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian judo
The judo home champions brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the gathering Russia.
According to this indicator, Russians have only stepped down as Japan's main congregator.
The tournament in Chelabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its holder was Beslan Wise, a category of up to 60 kg.
In the same financial struggle with Baldbaatar Ghanbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation had only resolved one observation received by the Russian Federation.
On Tuesday, three medals were won.
Male competitions in the category of up to 66 kg of silver reached Michael Pulayev and bronze in Kamalu Khan-Magomedov.
In the final round, the Russians gave up the 2011 and 2013 World Cup to the Japanese Masasi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, at the quarter-final stage of losing his fellow countryman, was victorious on a comforting tour and became a holder of bronze awards.
In the women ' s tournament, Natalia Kuzutina also reached the third step of the pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost the current World Cup of Mailind Kelmendi from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzutin won Ma Inan of China, but after the end of the tournament, she admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kälmendi, the winner of Kuzutina's previous final champion of Europe, was a barrier to Russia's gold.
On the third day of the Chelabinsca tournament, bronze was placed in a mine in a mine in Russia, where he placed Musa Möshkov, who had fought for up to 73 kg.
In a quarter-final, he was the former representative of Moldova, Victor Scoortsov, who is now in charge of the U.A.E. team.
But then the Russians won two contractions and became the recipient of the reward.
Moosekov performed at the home champion of a halonost injury that he planned to heal soon enough, so he would pause in the competition.
As for Skvortsov, an ex-Moldonian, he and he got to the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, as well as his other countryman, who had accepted OAU sports nationality, Ivan Remarenko completed his presentation in the category of 100 kg.
On the fourth day, PM-2014 also brought Russians with them one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg was conquered by Ivan Nyphontov.
He won Frenchman Alan Schmidt at the expense of his opponent's comment.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played on the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally limited to 90 kilograms of bronze.
This medal was guaranteed by its owner as Cyril of Questions, who was a fellow comforter of Russia, Cyril Denisov.
But there was no apprehension: the rival of Questionova couldn't get out on his dads because of his trauma.
The man's bronze was conquered by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed in a scrap of assembler by Renat Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
That's how the individual part of the world's pre-eminence ended.
On the last day of the Chelabinsk tournament, Sunday, the world champions played in the team competitions.
Both Russian assemblies, male and female, were among the main contenders for the prizes, but, as in individual competitions, the women of the fine sex were not fortunate; they did not reach the medals.
Russian Judaizers won command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they fought the 2-3 score against the main lobbyists of the competition, the Japanese team.
At the same time, the assembly of Russia led 2-0 after the net victory of Han-Magomedov and the free will of Denis Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, the rivals of Japan were unable to cope with Murat Khabachir (81), Magomed Magomedev (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
A bronze match also developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, with 2-0, gave in to the Japanese two to three.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was present at the Chelabinsk team competition, and after the end of the tour, he congratulated the male silver team.
\"The second place is an honor, but I'm going to say that it was obvious that you could be champions,\" said Putin, whose words are brought by RIA's News;
Losing the Japanese, the judo parentage, is nothing out of sight here.
But I'm sure you can win.
Russia's gathering at the World Home Cup has done much better than it did a year ago at competitions at this level in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals, one silver and two bronze, on the Russian team.
At the same time, the current tournament was passed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximumists.
Yeah, I want some gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in an Olympic cycle enters the eight greatest, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in the form of a sport such as judo, the tournament was summarized by the Minister of Sport of the RF, Vitaly Mutko, whose words were given by the press service.
The congregation of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, winning 11 medals of varying dignity, five of which proved to be gold.
The next world champion will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news, and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers was unconscious three days ago from her arrival at the hospital in New York, but her daughter hoped today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the illness.
“Thanks for your constant love and support,” said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart stop at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, reporting sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drugs and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains heavy.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from those such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripe.
Everybody can have kings.
The Royal Blood, a new hope for a British rock leading rock-duets from clubs, straight into the stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood is on stage for a whole year, but already has a nomination for the BBC music prize, a warm-up tour of Arctic Monkeys and a New York concert tour from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut one-named album was given 100,000 orders a few months before the release, and their contract for its release is in the Major Label Warner Music.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation comes out of a number of outlets, not the new Lane Del Ray or the sweetest speaker of the new R'n'B, but the duet of the exorbitant British, playing with the loudness and intensity that was the last time in fashion a couple of decades ago.
Generally speaking, the rates for the first album in relation to all the circumstances mentioned above were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
Dooette didn't see the name he had before, which had been able to interfere with what desperate hairy metal players had, and the blood that the kings were carrying, they thought they were alive, too, understood.
This is, of course, particularly about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the buried blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
Projecting on the success of this enterprise is probably early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs held in thirty minutes are more than a demonstration of phenomenal compositional gift than a sure and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say the pilot single - Out Of The Black - is that it's not remembered by the melody line but by the drum party.
Musicians say it's easier to write this song than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful \"Little Monster\" and the closing plate of the \"Better Strangers\" composition, with a Shakespearean quotation in the head.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound fine at a party of heavy - rock lovers, but when they are played in a row, they join a more or less uniform canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The Royal Blood force is that they don't claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney, but they take a lot of rock-duets out of the Indie Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was made for stadiums in a room designed for fewer than a couple of thousand people, is obviously close to her.
The secret is, in part, in the clever use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zeros of The White Stripes.
But it's not just about instruments, it's about making songs.
The zeros' retrocrats were very hard on their way outside the postmodern paradigm, and they were very reluctant to accept themselves not just as epigons but as independent creative units.
The Royal Blood, on the other hand, is now sounding so powerful and overpowering that it succeeds in scratching some of the secondary and hardness of the music material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what information was reported on Friday morning: The online engine, and the video producer, and a hundred other things, buys a $1.04 billion Twitch streaming video production service ($US970 million).
This news was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch video service sales for a good billion looked fully ready, and it looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a generic streaming service, the real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their playful moments; youTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And -let's play - a genre of videos that feature (mainly old) processing programs like the Secret Theatre - is already popular on YouTube.
The thing is that YouTube is mentioned often when it comes to describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is gaining Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of an embedded technology company buying off a potential competitor.
It's a secret why a YouTube deal failed, given that it was known that he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have for now is a statement from the Executive Director of Twitch Emmett Shire: \"We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.\"
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim they're better off playing sports than watching it, are hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking into their own hands the joystick.
One thing is to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch some outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so watching their own angle of view may be the recipe for a major pain worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the quick passage in which the Rogers Bannisters of our e-century finish whole games on record is fun.
But if it's not about a virtual game or a humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do the skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to make a living?
It's hard to imagine Twitch going back to Amazon Instant Video as elegant as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that would be happy to have any company: the crowds of young men who are wanted by advertisers.
As Twitch Shire, Amazon, and Twitch, said, both believe in the future of the game -- and this channel does not give signs of being trapped, even -- oh, like a great sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to survivors -- almost all of them now -- with the parents of the deceased, with the cemetery viewer -- the City of Angels -- the Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee -- the Mothers of Beslan -- the Susana Dudiewa, who was part of the MIC Special Operation, says, \"The Community - Elizabeth Antonov, who was working on a special project.
He had already returned to Moscow, met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago had been adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and had talks with terrorists, as well as with an officer in the office of the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What really shocked me during my work on this subject is that in Beslan, it's like there wasn't these 10 years.
This subject is extremely painful for anyone who has something to do with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
Travel impressions are very heavy.
But it's not possible to forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job,” said Antonov.
A special project was prepared by Chalding Rambler & Co, a studio working for the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and to Vladimir Putin's 15th anniversary in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Japan Sea area, reports Renhap
The launch was carried out about 10:30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, on the North Korean and China border.
It is alleged that the missile fell into the Japan Sea, some 220 kilometres from which the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff stated.
Members suggested accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015.
The State has introduced a draft law to transfer the date of entry into force of the already passed Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower chamber.
Its sponsors were made by the deputies Vadim Grogin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Eugeni Fedorov - One Russia - and Vladimir Parachin - Fair Russia - and Alexander Yuschenko (KPRF).
This change, according to the initiative ' s authors, will contribute to better and more effective enforcement of the rights of RF citizens to protect personal data and to respect the confidentiality of communications networks ' correspondence.
The law, whose entry into force is trampled on by parliamentarians, requires that the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be stored in RF territory.
It also makes it mandatory to record, system, store, store, clarify and retrieve personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roscomnadzor the power, by court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF legislation in the area of personal data.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called blacklist sites - an automated information system - Register of infringers of the rights of personal data entities -
This law was passed by the State Council in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrey Lugowa and Wadim Grogin of LDPR and Alexander Yuschenko of the PRRF.
Jacgin and Yuschenko are also co-sponsors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the law already passed.
Those who don't have any radio centers in the RF will have to pay for the rent.
Commenting on the bill before the State today, Leonid Levin, the first president of the Thought Committee on Information Policy, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that by 1 January 2015 would not have their own personal data storage facilities for Russians on RF territory would be able to rent them, e.g., U-Rostelecom, who has repeatedly said that they are willing to rent their servers and already provide their servers, with Mail Group, Western companies that are already providing their servers today.
“There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area” he added.
“If companies decide to enforce the law and continue working in the territory of the Russian Federation, I don't see any problem, they'll have the technological capability to accommodate,” means Levine.
Complicable bill
Immediately after the draft law was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its concern that Russian citizens would no longer be able to use many global Internet services if the bill was passed.
In particular, the services involved are the online reservation of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, the bill deprives the entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data with a mandatory determination that their record, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation -
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the record is being recorded, to systemize his or her personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
However, the adoption of such bills on - localization - personal data in other countries has led to the care of global services and significant economic losses.
A member of the ice-water bucket test threw his jaw out

This test of the icewater bucket went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test with a bucket of ice water that raised her jaw.
Izabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice water was poured on her head, which damaged her facial structure.
- The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to shoot, she said The Mirror.
The water's 20 years old.
Izabelle Roberts in seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't shut, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister had the same understanding at the time, and they started to snoop, but I had to be taken to the emergency office immediately.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to a hospital to control her jaw after participating in a popular enthronement on Tuesday.
The clip became an Internet message and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over over over 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
At the Norossiyah Army, alleged to have crashed Ukrainian Su27 and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
The militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side at 10:00 on 1 September, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported by Interfax, the Spokesman for the Army of Nova Scotia,
He added that the Su27 aircraft in violation of ceasefire arrangements was shot down by forces of PSB in the area of the town of Mereshka.
According to an agency interview, the Ukrainian side of the Lughan airport shelling had applied cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The press representative noted that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters at one of the field airfields during the night, as well as destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The casualties in the enemy’s life force — up to 100 people killed and wounded — were surrendered to 13 people — the staff representative summarized.
Interfax has no evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the national republics-Donbassa armed groups announced that the Ukrainian side had been handed over as part of the implementation of the ceasefire regime for 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DNR Army, according to data from the Armies of Novoroscia---pressekla, attempted by the Nazgvardians, in violation of previous agreements, to withdraw heavy machinery from the area of the environment -
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in short-run, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, the total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Marioupolsky) during the night amounted to five tanks, eight armed armoured vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
Last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Iloweska area of Donetsk province.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia asked the leadership of the People's Republics to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The DNR agreed to do so, provided that the enemy delivered the weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of troops left the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the British territorial defence battalion - Donbas - Semen Semenchenko, 14 more people left on Sunday night.
In his Facebook account, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were in captivity at 137 regiments of 32 RFs and 9 RF tanks, where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied reports from the Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond if new EU sanctions are imposed
Russia reserves the right to respond to its legitimate interests if new anti-Russian sanctions are imposed, reports the MID of the Russian Federation.
The report by the Russian External Diplomatic Department states that the conclusion of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of the EU member countries to overcome their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, drawing on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country” on the website of the department.
The Russian Federation regrets that the European Union, contrary to the interests of its member States, is influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as the provision of conditions for a full-fledged dialogue between the opposing parties, stresses the agency.
It is also noted on the website that there are no existing humanitarian assessments in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, as well as a growing number of casualties among the civilian population.
Recall that it is planned to develop specific sanctions proposals against the Russian Federation during the next seven days.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures imposed during the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New European sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Hazardous ways to save on university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who will soon go to grade two, has come up with a tricky way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
My maths textbook, which is usually worth $180, I received for a semester for $10 and my livers, Chick-fil-A, says Shredder, 19 years old, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student will spend over $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet games and creative ideas like the Shreeder system.
The rolling of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, often costing them much less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, with more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Studies of the industry show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores in the past spring semester were rented, says Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to a professional association - National Association of University Shops -
Here's an introductory course on the best way to make a good deal.
Purchase in an Internet engine
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book could be one third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition, the Math Analysis, by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostettler, is worth about $290 on the pre-seller, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of a detainee
If you're not against someone else's labels or injuries, the books you've been holding are a good option.
Mathematical analysis is a sale for $93.49 in follow-up form at Chegg.com.
Matt Caseday, aged 25, fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says that he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a further copy of the textbook “Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business”
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, College Without Walls, at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invites students to clarify from their professors whether previous publications are not available.
Sometimes updating is non-existent to the classroom.
In such cases, old publications are often found for a very small fraction of the value of the latest edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by -eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying books that have been held.
Procat
To rent textbooks, you need to think about it if you treat them well enough, don't forget to bring them back, and don't want them to be left behind after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a math analysis for a semester of about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that may be fined for marking, stressing, and damaging.
If you take the book for sale, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the value of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books, instead of traditional textbooks, are another option.
Sometimes such books are self-receiving by acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Procrastination-Mathematical analysis-- it's going to cost about $61 per six months on Chegg.com.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, since many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Holt, 29 years of age, who is about to start her studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you use the ISBN number to find out what book prices are, since that ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you make an order online, says Galt, make sure you check if the book really is on the warehouse.
That lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the full inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
President Vladimir Putin of Russia attended a meeting on the rule of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, reports Interfax.
- 15 billion roubles remained on deposits - the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State mandated that the approval of the list of territories for pre-development in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TORs should be introduced into the State of the fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, had not approved the list of areas ahead of development in the Far East until 1 July, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also set the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the transport accessibility of the region, lifting infrastructure restrictions on both the domestic market and export development.
Among other things, there was a need to create a prerequisite for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as for creating pre-development areas that should be competitive with key ATR business centres, the President stressed.
It was recalled earlier that the area of pre-development could be replaced by an EMS.
Why - The Garbage of the Galaxy Could Not Save the Cassus fees
“Inconsistents” — Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million of his 90 million budget to the United States, whereas “The City of Sins: the woman to be killed for — returned only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
- The home video, with Cameron Diaz, only brought $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's films such as \"How to tame dragon 2\" are also disappointed by the revenue.
The article on film criticism by the Telegraph Robbie Collin indicates that when it comes to children's films, it may be that the films themselves are of a bad quality.
Collin named 2014 as the worst, the year in history, for children's films, and called it \"How to tame dragon 2 - barely functional - by continuing fantasy.
However, when it comes to films that target audiences of a few older ages, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film that took place in summer with at least 2,000 copies between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account both the views of movie designers and movie critics suggest that this year’s film crops are similar in size to those of last year’s Hittites.
Some commentators suggest that it may be in changing visual habits and in the growing popularity of Internet services, such as Netflix.
The director, John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-run Disney film, \"The Jungle Book,\" said to the Hollywood Reporter website: \"I think times are changing.\"
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current drop in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the flow services reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, Mr. Stephen Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too heavily on comics franchises, and predicted Hollywood's collapse.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his grim predictions have had a share of truth.
Since several potential cash hats are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including those from the Altron-Mignonov- and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer of Louis H. Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of the cash tax fees simply “cyclical ” and said to Hollywood Reporter: “The passing summer will be the most cashiest summer in history, and no one will ever worry about it.
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in the European and Japanese kitchens, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it has so far chosen to replace imported products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
♪ There's a salty cucumber better than a bad strongarella ♪ ♪ The chef of the Italian restaurant, Barlotti Mariano Valerio, breaks down ♪
The mozarella and the burrat cheese ended at the restaurant first, they had a small storage period.
There's got to be enough Parmesan supplies for a couple of months.
What should I do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the market in Roadomillov.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories still do not let him go.
The meat was there only 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said we'd never buy anything from Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it changed right now.
But in the days I was given a test of fish from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be stupid!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised to learn that many of Italy’s common items are for Russian producers in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must depend to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, \"Where did you get that little meat?
I said it was yours too, Russian!
Why don't you do that?
In five minutes of walking from Barlotti in the French restaurant, Brasserie Bridge hangs a stop-list in the kitchen, which shows missing products: French oysters, sea food.
The restaurant's chef, Brasserie Bridge, and Bar Trecka-Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
In fact, Régis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: “The Cigarette is 200 roubles!
I ask, \"Why is it so much on what basis?
They say to me, \"Well, we have to make a living too.\"
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 roubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15 to 20 years, you know how much they weigh?
At the price, it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign cooks.
Standard history: \"For the first three months everything was fine, then quality fell dramatically\"
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibres and quality.
Many European cuisine restaurants don't know what's going to happen when the cheese supply is over.

The Sanction Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is generally referred to as product sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pork, meat and sub-products from domestic poultry, meats, delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, handicrafts, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have a chehard with suppliers — food prices have grown, and similar ones from other countries must be urgently sought.
The most powerful effect will be on expensive restaurants with monokuchinas in France, Italy, Spain, to which products have been supplied directly from mother - to - country countries.
The gathering had to be rescheduled sooner.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzur banned the importation of Australian beef and earlier American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer-2014 were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which was derived from the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, non-lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
The Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be reduced further.
For the time being, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, imports accounted for up to 70 per cent of their imports.
Dear restaurants will have to change their menus under what local farmers and other countries produce, says Sergei Myronov, restorator, owner of Restconsult -
If the chef is strong, he'll have no problem.
We only have very few such cooks, and a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from Brasserie Bridge is ready to do this: we'll have to give up between 10 and 15 percent of the meal, and half the other menu is to rework.
Mixer kitchen restaurants are already starting to replace dishes, such as steaks made from marble beef, with Befstrogans, Sergei Myronov says.
“Syres from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, and listed by the representative of the East-West company, Oxana Glybchuk.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have analogies in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production may be offset by products from domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In Mironov ' s view, budget networking restaurants would be easier to rebuild than the prize segment: it was unlikely that the Gourmets would have been able to distinguish the Italian stylus from the Russian.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project facilities, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under brands and their menus.
It'll take a lot of time to replace it, Mironov says.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, citing the lack of ownership in the country.
The owners of the Cafe of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisines stress that products from former Soviet republics are aroma better than Europeans
But there are also many restaurants that will not be affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with CIS kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani countries.
There is no expensive food in the Georgian kitchen,” says Hátuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the Wae Mae Cafe.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and on the basis of many chicken phyla dishes, exotic greens we don't use--
At Kolbai facilities, no food was yet removed from the menu.
Timura Lansky, owner of Chaihon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, is also not shy; he will only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia adjusts imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win a price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
The LPG can obtain cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits at a cost.
Yet, what is brought from Central Asia is far better than plastic from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
There's no Spanish saying that.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Education of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artikov, stated that he planned to increase the exports of fruit-based products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan indicated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost as soon as sanctions were imposed.
Fastfood restauranters who responded to the request for \"Deneg\" also respond fairly calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service claimed that localization exceeds 85% and works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia vendor department, about 80% of the product is purchased from Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and rising prices of meat produced from imported raw materials.
There were no more than 4 per cent of the commercial products used in the area.
Not affected by the sanctions, nor did the Lapsish-Vokker-
KFC, Burger King and Crouch Cartoshka did not respond, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On Your Hilltop
For the time being, repeaters complain that price increases even for local products, due to increased demand.
“Grabley - prices grew by an average of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant, Cherry Mio, twice,” says Restaurant Roman Rozhnikowski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dish will grow by 5-10%, and Kolbay will be recognized.
- East-West doesn't deny: \"For example, Belarusian dairy products have traveled between 10 and 15 per cent since early August\"
Brazil's suppliers have raised the price of pork almost twice, Sergey Cancer, Deputy Director-General-Stardogs-
The chicken was 35 per cent short.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll catch cold Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will be a planned 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's so unwelcome to raise prices,' says Cancer.
Statistically, the increase in the output of the general market in the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to rise, it recognizes, but is not clear how quickly: as long as most of the reservatories have been stocked with products for the next two months, in the hope of delaying the overruns of the purchase prices.
But what's gonna happen in two months, nobody knows.
The square in front of the mayor of Moscow is a dozen tents decorated with greens and trees.
In the middle of the scene, the musicians play the vals.
It's a lively regional food festival. - There's time to eat.
We've been going to make a holiday for the local food, and here's where the sanctions are, we've got a hurry, we've organized a festival, and one of the organizers tells us.
Behind the stage with Greek chefs Anastas preparing macaroni salads and household candy, there was a master class in the days to prepare a bodice with caramelized apples.
Russian groceries, organizers believe.
In tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Basqueria, a Salehard deer, fruit from the subsonic Sovhoz named Lenin, cheeses from the ringing Italian, Jay Klouz.
- Restaurant salmon can safely be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East, - says the fish bench owner - Your men - Philip Galkin.
We've got nerks, ketches, claws, humps, scoundrels...
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You take him in your hands, he won't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian strongarella with domestic
In the wind, his tent lies the shrimp with the exchanges of Magadan Tresca, ulmul, muxun, mussels with the Crimea, the ridges from the Far East.
Galick's sure it's time for a long time to move to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, more than 4 million tons of fish in Russia in 2013, a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imported fish in 2013: about 800,000 tons.
Lavka - His people have been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, and, before sanctions were imposed, serving about one and a half dozen more restaurants, such as Simple Things -
A further 15 restaurants have applied to Galkina.
The same land can be made of our fish, and it burns.
We stuttered, tried different recipes.
We're selling land online for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper than several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for Philadelphia's hand with the kite.
Unlike cattle, they have to chew longer, but knowing that this fish is our domestic gives strength.
On the bench site of His people, there are even Rolls from the paltus and the Sea-eye.
In sushi bars, the Norwegian salmon is really preferred over Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by making new recipes with far-east fish.
Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us - - gives their explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Essev.
The situation with other products is approximately the same: Russian manufacturers could have taken the loosed niche, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, it is now possible to refer to the substitution of imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is, the major producers in other countries will benefit primarily from the ban - Akimov says.
However, in the last month the restaurant industry has received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
Following massive unplanned checks, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the substance of the claims made to determine what action is necessary to open the restaurants for the visitors as soon as possible” stated Deengham in McDonald’s press service.
Nobody really knows what's going to happen.
If it is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous staff member of a restaurant consulting company.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be different.
- Europrotocol - instead of GIBD reference
Casco payments can be obtained without a HYBD - so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia -
The Bank of Russia has drawn up a draft directive that, as of 1 September this year, an insured car driver will be able to make a cash payment without a GIBD certificate.
This is true only when the accident was conducted in a Euro-protocol without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the limit imposed, and both drivers have consented to the question of who is the perpetrator of the accident.
Since 2 August, the cap on Europrotocol payments is £50,000, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to £400,000.
The fact is that often even in minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be handled by a Euro-protocol, drivers in an accident are responsible for the CPD.
It was not possible, however, to obtain compensation without a GIBD report if the policy was available.
The parameters set out in the draft guidance were intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum casco payment for accidents without GIBD staff shall not be lower than the euro-protocol limit -
However, it could not be higher than the one defined in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both the DPS staff and the roads.
But it's probably not coming as a surprise to car drivers or insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud that could lead to the introduction of new casco payment rules.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work would have to be done to overcome the existing Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for the inspector to handle a minor accident, because it's more reliable.
And it is not known that it will be easier to beat the conspirators, or to convince the drivers of the reliability of the Euro-protocol.
The savings certificate will make name and irrevocable
Minfin wants to ban predator savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them the same as an irrevocable deposit.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will prohibit the advancer's savings certificates.
This tool has been gaining popularity recently, as the rates are higher here than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the advance advancer's savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and the banks are cheaper because they do not have to be deposited with the Investment Insurance Agency (ASA) fund.
The tendency of the situation is that this step is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will be affected by it by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to be controlling 98 per cent of the business market.
According to the agency, the Bank of Moscow accounts for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the AFS, is that customers from a small bank that has purchased such a certificate try to obtain money from the ASV if they withdraw their licences.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured by lack of financial literacy and purchase advancer savings certificates.
The justified lack of insurance payments for these certificates in the event that the bank withdraws the licence may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In agency practice, there have been cases in which bearers have attempted to recover insurance through a court - they have stated to the ASV.
The problem is, of course, a thought-provoking one.
No one will pay the purchase certificates anyway, because they have no right of redress by law from the State.
Had the instrument not been insured in ASV, it would also have been prohibited by metal accounts in which money of citizens is recorded in grams of one of four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are also not covered by the deposit insurance system, but they are not yet attempted.
The fact is, it is likely, that bearer certificates are very convenient securities that can actually act as quasi-denegs.
Their movement is almost unmanageable: any bank client can purchase a certificate, transmit it to any citizen, and many owners can change the certificate prior to the disclosure.
It is no coincidence that the bill states that the savings certificate must be the exact security that must be kept in the depositary.
And in order to make the saw known to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without early payment.
That is, the same as the irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nuport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday, at Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Town Hall for what was described as anti-semmit.
Stephen Fairlau followed up our events during the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from all over the world, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter terrorist militants - the Islamic State - reports on 31 August to ITAR-TASS referring to the decision taken at the meeting of the FWG Government led by Chancellor Angel Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send 30 military anti-tank missile systems - Milan - and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
It was also decided to allocate an additional Euro50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement in the Bundestag on this subject.
So far Germany has not been putting its weapons on - hot spots -
The views of the FWG residents on sending arms to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that it is only this way to stop Islamic State fighters — others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia has beaten up a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Tagango Bay near the towns of Shirokino and Benamena (10-20 km east of Mariupola).
A number of Ukrainian media reports of the shooting of two coast guard boats.
The incident is reported to have occurred today at around 16:20 pm.
Adolescents were taken from the Blue Mountains by helicopter
The two teenage Bushookers were taken to a helicopter in a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man marched shortly after noon on Sunday, Govettes Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, which included local police and rescue teams, was sent, and the couple were found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl was hurt by her knee, and the young man fell down and killed his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on the winch Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mauntins Hospital.
Two Unions Meeting
The Minsk summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they were convened but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of Eurasia.
May it be on an alarming point (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate deference), the EU leaders and the Customs Union first discussed a number of urgent issues -
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is not clear; it is clear who removed the plums from the summit.
Questions in this regard fell off on the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians followed them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw new President Lukashenco on television.
Belarus's leader gave an example of extraordinarily sensitiveness, that was the behavior of a man who had just broken a jackpot, and was planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Madan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukashenco and allowed him to make a final briefing on their behalf, not merely the legalization of the President with a 20-year-old.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as the full actor in European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst at the Belarus Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Meliants, is certain that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as it used to be.
- The fact that Catherine Ashton met the t-a-tet with Lukashenco suggests that relations with the EU would get even worse.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the break-in of Belarusian authorities began long before November Maydan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have been achieved, and with the EU, they are successful talks on the simplification of the visa regime and readjustment, dialogues on modernization, lists the interviewor Fireka, and negotiations on international security have been held with the United States.
The United States has even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves had only caught up in the process and in the response of Belarus’s leadership.
Minscu, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough to avoid a serious loss of mutual trade, and President Porošenko could have come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, a Belarusian leader who de jure rejected the accession of the Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militia in Donbasa with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the DCDC, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington, D.C., noted Minsk ' s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue, and assessed it as confident by the Belarusian experts.
How successful the Lukashenko movement will be towards political diversification will be seen by how often, in the near future, Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service, Catherine Ashton, the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expected of the relationship in the new format.
Spokesman Ashton Maya Kosyančić simply stated, \"Ogonku, that, against the background of war and peace, this is not a priority.
Kazakhstan was reported to be the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The Degusty Drop for Minsk was the statement made by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked by the representatives of the European Union to do so.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not object to Minsk being the central site for meetings both in Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Union.
This means that the final dictator of Europe is becoming a fully-managed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
European farmer’s best friend
The composition of the EU delegation itself, which included Euro-commissioners on trade and energy, led to the conclusion that the main pillar of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbas but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas transfers and for overcoming the fears of TC countries by agreement on the association of Ukraine with the EU is more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless, pointed out that the EU representatives came to Minsk to find a solution to the political crisis, which had economic consequences, not vice versa.
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine is working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and especially the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are given to Minsk, who, as long as it is under the pressure of the sanctions, has been subjected to the long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research and Research Centre, an ex-candidate at the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation to bypass sanctions.
Supply schemes are being put forward for which Vladimir Putin at the summit held Minsk.
“Initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk - Fireku, “are Russian companies, not Belarusian businessmen.
They have long worked on delivery schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to re-establish them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies do not want to start manufacturing Ukrainian raw materials in Belarus as well as Russian-oriented products.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade-related production schemes can now be very demanding --
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiating site is ideal for Lukashenco and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions was estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million to the farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on Eurofarmers.
This could raise Lukashenco's credibility in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for taking the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk of its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format is being revealed, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev was the originator of the new format.
“It was your offer to meet, without any delay, to discuss, not from the bay-baracht to decide, following the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had arisen in Ukraine at the time,” he turned to the Chambers of Petra Porošenko.
In fact, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, in the hearing, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interactions on its land, has no beneficial objectives, and that the ultimate objective of such a format is to establish a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
- That's in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the security sphere, the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation - is being put forward and promoted - the fire - in the Ministry of Belarus, where words are being carefully picked up recently.
Covered-entry areas may appear in Moscow
The Moscow Government sees the option of introducing paid entry zones as a method to combat the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, and transmits M24.ru with reference to Moscow's castle on transport to Maximus Liksutov.
One option that has proven successful is paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, see all the negatives and benefits.
To say that some decisions were made on this matter until early, he told Lyxutov.
Zammer stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load to Moscow, is very important to the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central ring road, adding Lixutov.
The recently launched construction of the Central Railway is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were enough traffic infrastructure, there was no need to have a transit traffic in Moscow.
Also, Max Liksutov stated that the introduction of paid parking had significantly decommissioned the streets of the capital.
He said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop at what they had achieved.
Recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobianin, participated in the bookmarking ceremony of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Side Road (CCAD).
The skin is sinful
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez - The City of Sins-2: The woman for whom to kill was not the revolution that he could have expected.
The first, the City of Sins (2005), which was removed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comic books and literary nuor.
He is also revolutionary in his own way: in the sense that he destroys the fundamental for modern thinking of the chain - thesis - antithesis - synthesis - (if he understands the universe's nuar as opposed to comical antithesis).
From now on it should read “thesis - antithesis - chaos -”
The City of Sins-2 is chaotic at both the playwright and philosophical levels: both times it's chaotic in the wrong sense.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the city's first, although here is Marv (Mickey Rourke) who remember, ended up on an electric chair, and here, nothing but they're successful in bringing up the Ethacad-born wife of a knife and other stockings.
But the old people are literally pushed by newcomers, like breaking into town from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, in her story, shamelessly torn down by the authors at the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny, Joseph Gordon-Levit.
Yours is from the lusty-fried Eve Lord, and for something that is avenged by Dwight.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say the face is no different than Johnny's, is more so because the characters, like other parts of the body, are carried away with an inexorable regularity -- no trouble, not even half-wanted.
It's not people, but we understand that they're the archetypes of a nuar: a rock bitch who's too confident with a catch of honey, a sex detective, a corrupt pop-senator.
Well, when an archetype comes along with an archetype and an archetype, it's not a movie anymore, it's an abstract painting.
It's funny to ask abstract questions about the logic of the story.
Besides, even in this troubled world, there's something permanent.
First - City warboats continue to hold circular defences against slum-dwelling darkness forces.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is no-no-no, and he looks up at the fireman, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem, the City of Sins-2, is another one.
Frank Miller was good at how the painter giftedly linked the comic and the nure, and as the director, he turned the idea of how to put comic books on the screen.
Comics and nuir - two aggressively opposite - reality -
The novels of the modern comic were born in the late 1920s, while the novels of Daschil Hammet - Blood sting (1929), Malta falcon - (1930) and Glass Key (1931) created a canon of nuara, then known as a hard-boiled school - cool school -
Or a pulp faction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes, from the seaman Popaya, who devours the spinach, which gives him wealth, superman, Batman, and sysop Dick Tracy to Halka, Thora, Spider-Man, and other revengers.
But in any comic movie there was something harmful: the characters who were depicted didn't want to turn around with the screen flesh, they remained pretenders in the world around them.
Simply put, they were cleanly deprived of existence.
The nuar, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel, with experiences, characteristics, family scandals, and historical backgrounds, has lost all credibility.
Which Forions, which Tibos and Rugon-Mackara, which even the Bolkonians and Rostows even thought after Verdun, Auschwitz, and Hiroshima?
Such an affair had peacefully mutated into soap operas, and the criminal, by definition marginal, the affair had risen to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet found out on his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, at least, they were close to the comparty and the genre's pillars, such as the writers Horas Mackay and Jim Thompson, the directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lousy, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the nuir that archetype they've given is first, rough and cynical, and secondly, highly socialized.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first, the City of Sins, was marked by the fact that it was unnatural, but it was organically connected to the nuor.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, without being embarrassed by its graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a real movie.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the ugly son of a sadist, was quite worthy of Per Hammet.
And the painting details are sort of severed heads that the sadist has decorated his nest, over the genius of James Elroy, author of the Red Orchid, and the best, that is, the declaratively fat-faced, the representative of the neo-nonor.
The City of Sins-2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stylist-- Rodríguez before the comic.
It's probably largely because of the technology of 3D.
When you look at the second, the City of Sins, you feel trapped in a glass ball inside which snow falls down the toy hole.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood tents, but what difference does it make?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
It's only possible when, somewhere, we sometimes have a muddy swamp, but there's a normal world where we can get the girl back on the curve, or say to the troubleless parents that her destroyer is punished.
But if there is no place for sin in the city except sin, then there is no more sin but the norm.
It's as boring as any norm.
Chaos-The City of Sins-2 is just boring.
Justifiably, for the sake of domestic lepership, a small but pearly sin was granted to this young man’s father - in - law.
Titres warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the sight, in the very vegetarian episode of which the fingers of a man are broken to pieces, this is given to the man by the humor of hell.
Hammet would like it.
French socialists must -- shut up and bring France to order -- says the key ally, François Alland
Mr. Valle called for a deep-seated leftist force to demonstrate a warm attitude towards an attacked socialist president whose rebroadcasts were not approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
- It's our duty to stay close to him.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question the 35-hour workweek in France, despite the conflict-inflaming proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his Socialist party companions to remain alone with the Government.
However, Christian Tobiera, the Minister of Justice, put the sticks in his wheels, bringing the dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party to the assembly, and decriminating the Socialist Party for allowing the French to lose faith in the future.
Marin le Pe, leader of the extremely right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Wall Government would last longer than a few months.
François Olland is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valle is forced to gather a new government when he did not last summer.
“ And the new one will not last the autumn or the winter,” said Mrs. Le Pen to the reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be able to govern.
France ' s ruling party has been defeated in the March municipal elections, and the very right-wing National Front has come first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday magazine survey by Du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Oland's 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Cyans Po, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government could not correct the economy and record unemployment.
- He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to be quick to feel that something is changing - he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
♪ The city without drugs ♪
The Sverdlow Court of Arbitration left without a warrant the Regional Department of State Administration for the Foundation - A City Without Drugs - -
The authorities intended to recover more than £7 million from the organization as a rental fee for the building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice before the court.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlovsk region has abandoned the application of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Administration of the region (MUGISO) to the Foundation - City without Drugs - (one of the founders, Mayor Ekaterinburg, Eugene Royzman).
The representatives of the provincial authorities intended to recover RO 7.3 million from the organization as a rental fee.
Today, it has become known that the complainant has not appeared twice before the court, which has led to a decision to refuse the proceedings.
The failure to explain the reasons for the lack of representatives in the IUGISO Directorate was unsuccessful, and the Chief of Legal Division, Maxime Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
Nor was contacting the fund representatives.
Recall that this was a mansion that occupied a fund in the centre of the city on the street of Belinsk, 19 on a grant basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Administration of Sverdlow Region filed an action with the Sverdlow Arbitral Tribunal for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the authorities had required, through the court, that a place for a monument should be recognized as a non-conclusion contract.
According to the IUgiSO directive, the agreement did not establish substantive conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlow arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim and an appeal was filed in the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed an appeal in cassation with the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed to the High Court of Arbitration by the Fund, but the court took a stand against the directive.
In 2013, a new lease was concluded and the fund again began to pay rent, as told by the head of town, Eugeny Roizman.
The rent was awarded at £300,000 per month.
The previous administration has given us this building free use, recognizing our counter-narcotics responsibilities, in respect of the fund.
The current administration had decided otherwise -- he had said.

Why Mayor Ekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of the pride of Ekaterinburg, a single-minded Alexander Kosinc, invited the mayor of the city, Evgeny Roizman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought against a man arrested on suspicion of murder of a retired member of the deputy ' s pride, Oleg Kinewa, who was considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman Found Criminal Case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been initiated on the blog of Mayor Ekaterinburg of Evgeny Roizman on the fact of “clevette” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code).
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Sverdlow Field Department, where a statement was made by the Director-General of the Legal Centre - Defense - Anna Philatov.
She said that Mr. Royzman accused her of her blog entries that she was involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse.
Mayor Ekaterinburg is convinced that this is another attempt to avenge the truth -
iPhones will turn into wallets
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple has to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press as to what can be expected from the presentation.
Referring to the sources, American media report that the sixth generation of iPhones will be equipped with a mobile purse as a result of the joint Apple project and Visa payment systems, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet resource, a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express could be launched to present new products on 9 September by Apple, among other things, and as a result a mobile purse will be accessible to the new iPhone.
The companies themselves do not comment on this.
This function allows a smartphone to pay on the store counter.
The payment identification will be made by the user on his fingerprint using Touch ID.
It is reported that the iPhone will have the first NFC (near field communication) technology, which enables the payment of contactless payments by the smartphone and the appropriate reader on the cashier.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special micro-processor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, the promotion of this technology.
The first telephone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google submitted a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, United States pilots are still cautious about innovation and do not be too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops.
Therefore, observers are now hoping that Apple’s entry into the market will still make the steroids faster and more actively introduce the technology in their shopping malls.
MID France: Paris ' s position on Russian-Mistrali supplies is unchanged
The official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated Paris ' s consistent position regarding the Russian supply of Mistral-type helicopters to Russia.
“I may recall the statement by the President of the Republic (François Olanda) in an interview with Le Monde of 20 August: “Today, the level of sanctions does not impede delivery.
This decision by the Europeans, not by France, quotes Mr. Nadal-RIA News -
Thus, a representative of the French foreign policy agency responded to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' position to comply with the contract.

At the end of the operation, data on the losses and the causes of the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation would bear responsibility,” added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss the situation further under Ilowesky, where several Ukrainian battalions were caught in an environment.
According to the representative of the SNBO, every effort is being made to return the troops who have been captured, ITAR-TASS reports.
Mr. Lysenco also noted that the Ukrainian military had left Luhansk airport in the direction of the settlement of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise Draws Close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final phase of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market company, a Class-lux cruise vessel, and client-backed Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced earlier this week, reporting sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources asked to remain untitled, as negotiations were not open.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments, whereas the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands Oceania and Regent, which collectively own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It claimed a income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth in the middle class in developing economies such as China and India in the years to come.
On-the-job companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulatory bodies for primary public share placement in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 by merging with a cruise operator owned by Gening Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment conglomerate and casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public campaign in January 2013.
Gening owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise passengers in North America, according to registration documents for the first public share of the Prestige Cruises.

Hong Kong Democratic activists interrupt the Chinese statement the day after the election
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress on Sunday established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to vote in the election of Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of a majority of the members of the expulsion committee who are likely to be captured by the Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for a democratic opposition to enter a ballot paper and has forced democratic activists to renew their promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre by protest - Occupy Central -
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, the democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands entered the business centre of the city and set up a sit-in strike.
The ly briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Jeang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Feng Wei State Council were also required to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would be gathered from the Hong Kong Head of Government building in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join the 400 ha of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intended to join 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
As the Bi-bi-si indicates, the decision to join the land of Southern Bethlehem is linked to the desire to repay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers this June.
The Israeli Defence Minister announced the occupation of the Territory on Sunday and charged the military with the administration of the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikat, the world public must call upon Israel to be held accountable for its continued settlement activity in the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem.
Putin requires Kiev to begin negotiations on - the State - eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to suggest that the eastern Ukrainian territory, under the control of the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's appeal to the Kiev Government to initiate negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals the obvious strategy that he should have followed from the beginning of the massacre five months ago: help the separatists to take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared territory of Nova Scotia de facto independence to get closer to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State's First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territories held by the separatists to the eastern Donetska and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
Kremlin and separatists have recently named the captured territories of Nova Scotia, or New Russia, a name that sends back to the pre-revolution days the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the `plenary of illusions' reported ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of the society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words of statehood were in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It's not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, 'because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict' -
Kremlin’s press secretary’s intervention to correct “unverified interpretation” emphasized the Russian leadership’s decision to behave towards the separatist revolt in the east in a different way than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population were ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Luganese regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and interviews prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by conveying to the Kremlin the actual control over territory that would link the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was joined five months ago, had a major Russian military fleet as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
There are also mines, factories and foundries in the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, following the new elections, weigh the amendments to the Constitution, allowing the regions to have greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose arms and instigation are accused of Moscow.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to agree with separatist leaders as equals followed the new offensives of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the formerly peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The separatists supported by Russia have taken control of the town of Novo Azovsk in the attack, which Ukrainian security officials say is afraid of being the start of a campaign to take the strategic coast to the Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants, between Nova Scotia and the narrow crossing of the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels called for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
“ We are approaching the point of non-return,” warned Porošenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit had not taken certain measures; the leaders called for a draft more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation in the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their position in Ilowesk after two convoys of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficulties facing separatists, Colonel Andry Lysenco, the Spokesman of the National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, reportedly held in Ilowesk as a result of the Russian invasion, was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air detonators captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lysenko on Sunday.
The naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen naked pictures of his bride Gabi Greco and his entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is angered by the fact that a number of frank photographs portraying the naked Jennifer Lawrence have come online as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible has about 60 frank photographs of the star-Golden Games-Lourens and superstars, including the models of Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, the singers of Ryan, Arian Grande and Leah Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski, and Melbourne Greco are also believed to have stolen photos from iCloud.
In list 101, the name of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco's last month's proposal, said: \"It's disgusting.\"
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was a \" shameful \" and that those on whom it was directed felt that they had been invaded --
The hacker is expected to have 30 Palmer photos with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she lies at a chest-boiled pool.
Palmer's works in film include love and honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, film star - Chak - Insurance and an actress from the \"Prohibition\" - Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: \"It's a sudden invasion of privacy\"
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: \"To post photos stolen from a mobile phone is in fact no different from selling stolen goods --
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential means of stealing naked celebrities
The massive takeover of stars accounts may have been made through the vulnerability of the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario was described by the resource of The Next Web.
On the Github resource, a Python script was published to pick passwords for the Find My Phone Apple service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone's location.
It uses the same login and password link as the Apple ID to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photographs of celebrities were stolen.
This script enabled Find My Phone to get a password.
This method is consistent with all possible combinations of symbols, beginning with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that there were unlimited number of passwords entered in the Find My Phone service.
When the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user for an attempt to break.
Vulnerable users have not received any reports of an attempt to obtain a password for their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Hackapp user on Twitter, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password-selection script was written.
The vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that it was such vulnerability that had been used to access the account star -
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister re-appears to have foreign records.
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability to Find My Phone has been used to steal photographs, there has been a wave of harmful activities using this service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the cloud ' s safety had not been compromised, but that it had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Tweet Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, had also been captured.
If the attackers had access to iCloud as described above, the password for the government head's account in the microblog service could also be stored there.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability to Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-board
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian sportsman, Anne Burak.
A decree was published on the legal information online portal.
Early this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and asked the Federation of Modern Fives to speak in favour of a composite RF.
In 2013, it won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European personal champion and became the World Cup of the Mixed Estate, one of the new types of sport programme.
It also retains leading positions during the current season.
Under the rules, to speak in Rio in the Olympics-2016, she would need to obtain a special permit from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Catherine Lagno, who is the bi-communal champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world on the side of (2010) and the fast-paced chess (2014).
On the part of the female team of Ukraine, the athlete was a winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the world team champion in Astana (2013), and the European team champion in Warsaw (2013).
The CSR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnocovo
The Investigation Committee of Russia (TCR) has terminated criminal proceedings concerning the accident of the Tu-204 Air Force Red Wings.
This is reported by the department's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the ship engineer.
The forensics had shown that the crash had resulted in an increased speed of landing, the failure of crews to comply with standard landing procedures, and the unintentional failure of engines to turn straight.
The Too-204 Red Wings, following Prague-Moscow flight, collapsed on 29 December 2012 when it landed at Vnukova airport in Moscow.
The airship drove behind the runway and lit up.
An aircraft commander, second pilot and ship engineer were killed at the scene.
Two ship attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where the injuries subsequently died.
Three other chest attendants, hospitalized with severe injuries, were given long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car was severely injured when he was in a traffic accident along the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board an aircraft.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor conducted a post-disaster inspection at Red Wings, which revealed numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of human beings
An honest expression is biologically universal to mankind, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is an additional means of expressing power and threat, and scientists in Australia and the United States have discovered.
They told Evolution and Human Behaviour about their discoveries, and briefly read them in a press release at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The wrathful expression of the face - pushed and lowered down the eyebrows, stretched out into a thin lip line, crushed nostrils - in the same way in all cultures, making it even blind from birth to children who have never seen it, notes the leading author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have discovered that this emotion has arisen to deal effectively with disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more opportunities he can dictate his circumstances, and he brings it to the interviewer by means of anger.
The researchers also found evidence of their own hypothesis: physically strong people tend to become angry and hands-on, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions that disenfranchise others, and prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to be peaceful.
The scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles creating a angry expression should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make it possible to accept his conditions as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
In order to test this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer a person who was present or absent from each of the seven elements of an angry person and showed them to informants.
Although the abandoned eyebrows or the forward chins did not individually make the person evil, the physically stronger participants in the study recognized them unanimously.
The wrath of man, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power to accept and obey.
The human being blows his nostrils and burns his lips for the same purpose as the frog that's wearing, or his grandmother who's showing off his ticks.
“Gnev is launched by refusing to accept the situation and the person immediately takes the form that shows as effectively as possible the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, and all of them express the same thing -- said anthropologist John Tube.
