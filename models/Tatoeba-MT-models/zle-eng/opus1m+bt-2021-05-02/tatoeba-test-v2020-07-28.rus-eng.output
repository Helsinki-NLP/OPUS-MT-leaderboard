I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom pretended not to have happened.
I promised myself I would quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He bought a bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't understand me.
What are you so mysterious about?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Outside the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's stupid.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come either.
Last week, I ran into Boston on Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to cook.
I told 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Would you like an anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what Tom should do?
I can't just ignore him.
She rides a bicycle to school.
I'll pay for it!
Would you like to drive?
I've been doing it all day.
They're peers.
A coin fell under the table.
She's empty.
Wash the windows.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here, the rest go out.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
A caravan of fifty camels was moving unstoppably in the desert.
You must be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I changed places with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
Why are you sneezing?
Tom didn't tell me how he was going to get to the place.
Didn't I tell you I was allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I'm not going to show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He came to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
The cosmonauts are wearing scaffolds.
Algeria buys artillery weapons from Russia.
To tell me, what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why does Tom have to apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room's empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We were sleeping under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Isn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20?
I have to go to work right now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it begin?
A hug is one of five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you come up with a name for a novice?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got infected with him with a cold.
I like Brazil, but yet I'm going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do it.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The bitter grave will fix it.
The soup is so hot it's impossible to eat.
Why is it so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where'd you get so much hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was waiting for them to give me some good news.
Distilled water is delicious.
Father's in the garden right now.
Harry works part-time at the local supermarket.
Very unlikely I'll be late.
I told them to be in their hats.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I once dreamed of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom plans to break up with his girlfriend.
Where will you be tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I only knew Tom for a few months.
You are hopeless!
Tom plays the violin very well.
No one blames you.
Next year, Rabbit's year.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennis is the only sport Tom owns.
Come to the basket.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember that I love you.
He's a murderer, they say.
Mary didn't want to wear Halloween a clean suit, so she decided to dress like an Ames woman.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I'm not going to be that way anymore.
Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even slow down.
I don't want Tom to go somewhere without me.
I watched you do.
He's got great math skills.
On the road.
He's a remarriage father.
Men were men at the time.
The Swiss banks are very secretive.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom's gonna say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
Do you want us to do this together?
All our attempts were waste.
He poured himself another glass.
Now, I'm gonna start listening to the patient, and make sure you've followed through on the procedure, and you're gonna need to use it tomorrow.
Please salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom was sleeping in the barn.
You'll ruin your eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie?
So you didn't have to ask me twice.
You should go to Boston.
I'm excited.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I seldom see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
Your face shows you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a ruined plate.
I can't let him go alone.
Tom broke the window.
Jesus demonstrated the perpetuation of God’s law on unclean animals by allowing the pigs to enter the herd.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
It's my birthday.
We have to tell people what they need to do.
If she's inexpensive, I'll buy her.
I told Tom what to do.
She almost drowned.
It was a good movie.
Are you a beam?
I'll never let you forget that.
Tom forbids me to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave the will to anger.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She's probably refusing to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you pee?
I know you work for them.
I hope I can help you.
Is that what your parents know?
The waitress went on the table to scrape.
I stayed at home that day because it rained.
Is there a pharmacies around?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told them that my car had been stolen.
We can discuss this later.
It's a little helpful.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for the oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom attached a wet towel to Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We want to leave.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't mean to be shy.
Can you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find the difference between the two photos?
I've never seen so many books in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
The cats have a rough tongue.
I would never do that.
Fix him, please.
We need to get a bag of ice to cut the drain.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here tonight.
- Who are you by nationality?
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you do.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
Zontika broke down.
Tom put his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't really like Tom.
So we're going to have to change plans.
Someone bit him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is England's capital.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Get her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Take a smell of this.
Tom wakes up from deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do that.
I hope I see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What were you and Tom doing after dinner?
I'm very unlucky.
As is often the case, Mike was late this afternoon for a meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law prohibiting violations of the law.
It's not done yet.
John said so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his sight.
I didn't give it to Tom.
Strange rumours.
I know you're rich.
Bill set aside a hundred dollars for the trip.
He served in the Navy.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom blew his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I won't rob you.
He was in the car and left.
Tell Tom what happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
That's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom's been hurting his teeth for three days now.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope's dying last.
It's the girl that came last night.
I'll give you a new one.
You sort of said it was yours.
Where did he buy those shoes?
Don't make me do that.
Why did you smile?
Tom usually drives a bus to work.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Is that what I think?
Everyone but Tom has a hat.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is this selling?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have that much more?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a tin in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I did it when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't go into other people's business.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for eyes.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
It's a half-third time.
The lion is strong.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the hat.
Why don't we take a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of cats.
I heard you were playing banjo.
Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom regrets leaving Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks French awfully.
I don't remember how much I paid for this.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I barely got on the train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle your job.
After Mary gave Tom a kiss, threw a glass of wine through him, and took a firm step out of the restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We found them out.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary in private.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's father, who is in prison, never writes to Tom.
It's expensive.
I didn't get any news from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of here.
Please just do everything like me.
Wait there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what luck is called.
It was so dark in the room that I had to walk through the touch.
How many air carriers do the U.S. Army have?
Is she your teacher?
Sing again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots in the winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I am very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
What time are you waking up?
Get the trash out of here.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief broke through the window.
Spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without moustache like saltless soup.
You tried to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So many things happened today.
I saw a car crash a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired.
You know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept ticking her.
Six goes in front of the family.
Today I went to the grave of my grandfather.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw the man who ate from the trash tank yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told him he should talk to a lawyer.
Did they get back on that wrong bus?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom's an anti-Semitic.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
I wonder, when Angelika Agurbash sang a song on the words of Neckleev, could she imagine that he would be running for president?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always expressing himself frankly.
The Thomas's got to be there at two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely tired.
Was Tom out of his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't like anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant is burned.
John's not paying attention, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took an interview from Mary.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's that guy?
Keep the kids away from the pond.
We'll talk about it tonight.
I have to fix this.
They don't know French.
Get out!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's starting to get drunk a little bit.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still don't feel like a lice.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do that yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you want to say?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're going at six.
The deer was the victim of a lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to talk her through us.
Are you with us?
Remember your wish.
Tom's alive.
The log may be in the water for ten years, but it will not be a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than that.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get so energetic?
Put your signature here.
Whoo-hoo!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels, and a woman is like what she looks like.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
In the last year, there was a lot of snow.
He tried to swim through the river.
Everything looks good.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like walking along the river.
You can come with me.
This is a great gift for us.
\"How many for dinner?\" \"Five minutes.\"
Let her know.
Mary spent all her time working.
Tom sat on his motorcycle and got him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I was waiting for him to be ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How French to date,
It wasn't so expensive.
What about your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to fire you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes hanging out with bad guys.
It is often said that one language disappears every week in the world.
She has a small advantage.
I thought we were talking about it.
How sad my parents would have been if I had failed.
I feed the cat every day in the morning and evening.
Hold your tongue, you're not getting it.
You must take into account all the implications before making any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite, I don't have teeth.
I think you did great.
We had heavy rain last night.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my ankle.
There's nothing more to tell me about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Get home early, Bill.
She sat on her chair reading the magazine.
It is forbidden to cry from this moment on.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
Here's the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
Enthroned in white, the house seems to be bigger.
I have had trouble finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I watched the movie in French with the English subtitles.
I have lunch.
I think Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never does.
Can you play banjo?
Tom came up to Mary and hugged her.
♪ When you get back ♪ ♪ Everything depends on the weather ♪
How many turtles live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my building.
I was irritated.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom's probably gonna win.
What would you like to do to get Grandpa Morris to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your adventure cheater spirit?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done that yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
You have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the hat.
Put him on the stick.
I thought you found someone else.
There are always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's pointless to pretend that you make me believe that I believe what you don't believe.
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think it's possible?
Trusting everything, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked?
If it's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom didn't seem to know you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Do you read anything but the Bible?
Read me the score from the boiler.
What does this gentleman do for himself?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Your parents know that?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoeb is not to make your mind over your stomach or below your knees.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the strike.
I don't know your name.
What time is the train coming to Boston?
What words do you have to say to that song?
Mary likes to tease her brother.
The law is on my side.
So I had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was on Professor's birthday.
Your phone called several times while you were in the shower.
She married him because of the money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
An account, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You have a birthday soon.
Check it out.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Of course, he's best suited for that job.
You're gonna make it easier for me to do this.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know those men out there?
Tom got out of the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished lunch?
Tom and Mary were talking at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many tie-ups do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the latest rumours?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a brunt.
My mother taught me not to waste my money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took my place.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it matters to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not going to be late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live quite close to you.
Tom's looking after the horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to return to Australia.
Usually people die if they are killed.
They turned Tom off from his life supply.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's twice your age.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't be able to do that.
I was tired of my 12-hour trip.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do that.
He came back two days later.
Tom's in the middle of the day.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help that wash the windows?
It's out of my mind.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm not the only one here.
Don't tell him what happened.
I'm not gonna just give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these postcards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom said he's sorry.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.

She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give anyone that dictionary.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take it from me.
I know Tom's superior to Mary.
I didn't have time to do this today.
Mary told Tom she'd help him.

Do your children know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives up the fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win the time.
I already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a terrible sense, from the point of view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of the Hebrew, thus showing that there were incontestable claims that there was a sacred language whose use in prayer was particularly close to God.
Finally, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for that.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
Weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of the young man.

I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
It's a routine job.
Who else on your list?
Don't let that be my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He was horrifying in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?

Somebody said something, but I didn't take it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice's upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think it's a drug that's going to do a lot of good for you.
Tell Tom to be here by half of the third.
It's not the god of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't talk to her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?

Tom's in the kitchen, washing the dishes.

Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is selling well.
I need to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words upset me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response is amazing.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go now.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm having a good dream.
That's why no one else's business except himself.
I'm from Sizzuoka.
Tom slept all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.

What do you want to talk about?
Tom yells at Mary.
That's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom sort of said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very prodigious.
Again and again, obstacles appear in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.

I knew you could be trusted!
Tom put the wood in the fire.

What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.

Have you ever sat down?
If I had money, I would buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, isn't he?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because he didn't have enough money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!

I think you can trust that.
There's a lot of puzzles in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotter apple.

What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll be thinking about you every day until I get there.
It was a bad bet.
Thought she was coming alone, worried me.
The account's a sizeable river.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He gave an account of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He's definitely coming.
Is there a message?
Yesterday suddenly, Tom called me.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
The accident took their only son.
Everybody knows there's something new in this old capital.

Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.

No direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.

What do you like about him?
When I arrived at the station, I called my friend.

I hope you're lost on this account.
Sometimes you need to tell the truth.
Tom is dusty.
I have a proposal for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I'm in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's going to study till late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I've been talking to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God is foreordained to be united in Jesus Christ as kingly power and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went to his own house.
It's thin, but it's firm and it's not broken.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five for the TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me, please, where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope nobody saw you come here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I was not beautiful.
Do you cry often?
We did not expect such results.
I already read that.
If the car breaks down, let's walk.

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...

My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The dark's invisible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll come and get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bath.
Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
The book is big.
Don't say that about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks kind of upset.
I brought cookies.
Tom will teach French next year.
I've been listening to her for the rest of the time.
I told Tom to rest.
Why are you angry?
The worst part of the trip is already in the back.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that in the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her to the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was really good for me.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
That is a situation I would very much like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He never survived that.
Don't you want to come with us?
Is Tom able to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
\"Shut down your fucking music and read the book.\" \"Vija, my censorship spell still works!\"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There is no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding from your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary again for forgiveness.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really wanted to go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's get quick or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary moved in.
How do they get you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary sewed Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary got better after her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where'd Tom get that?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody loves me.
Too bad I don't know Tom's phone.
You told him - - - No, he knew it himself -
Your explanation was very clear.
I missed the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.
Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
Yesterday I read an interesting book.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the weeping iwa.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom led both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river was watering the garden.
A strong wind's closed at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.

I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to know me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I used to lie down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had trouble parking.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom's never been late in school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it begin?
There's no matter what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
- How'd you get my phone?
When are you going to clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane is flying at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's low, but he's strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find Tom, please.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's a joke.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
I thought he was going to kiss me.
Don't hurt me.
Are you having fun?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I work today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's a solid paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, right?
She hurt her back by playing tennis.
Tom's scared.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I heard about all your problems.
I know him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they were riding a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the next church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What action do you expect Tom to take?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Click on the button.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary carried her boots to her knee.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rough.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't need to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time, Tom was first.
Everything's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long handles.
Tom was in his sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How'd you like my story?
Tom turned off the alarm clock and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could've told me.
This will bring your family's misfortune.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to fall asleep.
Mom's helping me a lot.
Tom has a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Walk on the pavement.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I don't have to tell him.
You won't buy happiness.
Tom grew up in a children's house.
I don't want to watch this video.
The EU's poorest country is poorer than the poorest state in the United States?
Say hi to Tom from me.

We will do our best.
Would you buy that?

She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?

I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.

Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.

What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!

I'm stairs.
It's the largest car in the world.

Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?

How much time do you have for this?
We finally have everything we need.

Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
Somebody yelled.
How much better?
We thank you for your help.

Let your uncle think of it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.

It's been ten hours, my mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
The owls are cute.

Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he gets there.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far away?
How much time is it now in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
Nobody knew why.
Jim won't come today.
You'll be father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll snow this year for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you until you pay me just as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one Tom likes here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have such a second chance.

All accounts have to pay me.
She's gone.

Tom didn't seem happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.

She's the lazyest person I know.
Is Mary out in her room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.

Come out now.
Can I look at your rights?

How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets for a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's a fucking bitch.
He dictated some of his secretary's letters.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note to Tom.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from the third.
He likes it so much.

Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day, you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, chicken!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I didn't sleep until two o'clock in the night.
Maria was not thirsty.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for the permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love bitter pepper.
How much do you normally get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're packed.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
Man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die?
Does Tom speak French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured a cup of tea on Mary.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defence.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll get to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife doing?
I'm trying to get through this.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eyes of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled and his usually pale face became alive and rustled.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were shaded from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it with caution.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I'm waiting until I see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
Something that doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why do you call?
I don't like people who insist on politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, did you suddenly get into the fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Last night our granddaughter was born.
Tom's wearing a pirate suit.
That's true!
Let's get some ice cream.
What do these people do?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom's got to be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
So I should have asked Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is the one for whom he betrays himself?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezuba, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay a little longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to smoke flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go to this room.
Have you had any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom's very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hess.
To be honest, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought before a court, it is generally accepted that the jury should have twelve members.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
Boys marched four by row.
Tom was really upset.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
There's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on quick, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do this.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world-known for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like those spirits?
The castle's broken.
Diamond is a precious rock.
Cook with cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Back off, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self - esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice encountered in anticipation of her response was a sudden war, it was a loud noise, so sharp as to break her eardrums, so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost it in a crowd.
We talked about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary put her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it up.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
It's going to go out, and it's going to come back.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
A monkey climbs a tree.
The language I teach is very complicated.
Your child can walk.
That's all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom has the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president rules for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you decide that?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom comes back, do you?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little longer?
You're gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice, he would have been a rich man now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind has risen.
Tom had no courage to jump with the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had the premonition that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom spoke in a dream last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl got the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell 'cause you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix Mayonese with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got a little bit of sleep.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't be angry with her.
I'd rather stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came into mind.
She's resting right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and orderly.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in someone else's land.
Tom's been watching.
Tom's face is beautiful.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
He had an abstract hunger; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, yesterday was the rain.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of the two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it a lot.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there's a time for discovery.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good for animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
The Thomas is away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We wept with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What are you doing here?
Oil, cheese, and much more can be made from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her little daughter.
Be nice.
You like jazz, right?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uncalled guest.
Are you popular?
Russians won, as everyone expected.
He jumped back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think of asking for any help from Tom?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's been hungry except for me.
Tom's really excited.
No snowflake in a snow avalanche considers itself guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French, like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's like spitting.
I really liked this book.
You are important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell the cop his real name.
I went there to school.
The fish is still raw.
Try to remain positive.
I've been sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Does it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who's Tom playing with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my mission.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
You're not going to come in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.

Is this book publicly accessible?
Please, could you talk louder?
I'm going to tell him to contact Mary.

There's nothing useless about nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
Do I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I locked the door, but I didn't lock it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thanks for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
I'm taking the lead now!
People who are good to us all year.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20.
She thought I'd let her down.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom took his secret with him to the grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?

What do you think of that?
Let's eat breakfast quickly.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why is everyone looking at us?
Where are Tom's keys?
Am I right with your name?
Nobody saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find it.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.

You have time.

That's why we should go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You can't do anything.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got some questions.
Are you looking for anyone?

So I didn't have to hide.

I tried hard.
That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by a guardian angel.
Tom ruined his bank account.
She's at the hotel right now.
What's going to get me out of this?
He was so curious that he paid attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.

I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is stronger, money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There are lots of children's books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't hold back from starting to sing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The resulting spot still left a trail on the bubble.

Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you came back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?

Payments will be made based on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.

I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There are no exceptions to the esperantto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early tonight?
You wouldn't survive.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset.
There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest person.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.

No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I was shaking my head badly.
Tom, you're being called.
You promised me you wouldn't drink tonight.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works that way.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd be back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk about it to Tom?
Is it a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.

That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she wasn't there.
We have plenty of food today.

Tom never knows what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard for the president.
If you're hungry, eat.

He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of that right now.
I don't trust her.

Find yourself a nice suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're bigger than the Spartacus!
That's how he showed his celebration.
Why did he need Tom?
It's capital investment.
It's really bitter.

You promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.

Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read that.

I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
Do you think it's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't run into the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
What if he comes back?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to keep going.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
Friday, we're gonna have lunch.

I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, you left the bar just the moment I was gonna get everyone a drink at my expense.
Tom told me it really works.
I want to play chess.
I support you 100 percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her what you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We don't have much snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate to wait.
I sometimes see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
Yesterday was fun.
Where did Tom take those pictures?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom kicked him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage your money.
How does one relate to the other?
I could do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where was Tom?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?

It was taken with the shelf.
Tom doesn't know where it is.

I have so much to say.
Answer - yes -
I think Tom wants you to do it.
Give me your new address.
Can you see me from there?
He told me.
Did you discuss this with Tom?
Tom set the cigar on fire.

I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who comes to my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I came to visit you.
I feel like an ammo.
Our team came home with triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I was listening to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so sober?
He got involved in his Chinese teacher, but, with all these hormonal affairs, he got involved in almost every other thing.
I'm glad to inform you that I'm completely cured.
I wrote a lot of suggestions for esperanto.
Aquarrel I like more than a pastor.
I can't make an exception.
He's fast thinking.
I can find them.
I'm here right now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I am my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pass the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves fishing, like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a supporter of white race superiority.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better at cooking than I am.
He's swimming like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary what to buy.
She brought metla.
- Tom, hurry up - - - I'm coming -
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've already encountered this problem.
I'll try to say it French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to a concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunglasses.
Come on, Amelia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Negative times negative gives us a plus.
There's a dead body in the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to bed.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech really upset us.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look eerie.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold a smile.
Wait a minute, you said girl- or-boy-
I wasn't trying to kill them.
Education is the knowledge that you didn't even know what you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought about it before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I got two fishes.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's sick.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in town?
The interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed unsure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if it's warm.
There's so many of them.
He couldn't compromise his principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You'll probably have three hours off.
That was an easy decision.
Mary said she was coming early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
That could be anybody's.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is endowed with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
Telling the truth is the key.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong in my mind, too.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I used Tom's shirt by mistake.
Looks like the bank's robbery has been planned up to the point.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's butcher, isn't he?
Don't force me to kill you!
What do you like better than that?
They don't respect him.
No choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You can't answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish alligators from crocodiles?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower this morning?
All right, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In the face of ignorance and freedom, the nation expects things never happened and will never be.
Tom barely breathes.
Dogs don't know the colors.
Tom poured the water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
Tom's house was practically destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's wrong.
There is a significant difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I have to tell him not to do this again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he looks like that.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She constantly complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That very second, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two cases at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone into the woods alone.
Nobody sees my tears.
Tom's asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repetitive.
Tom's never kissed anyone yet.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to our neighbors about the noise management.
I won't let you do it.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is a virtue.
When you meet for a new year, you'll spend it.
The library has no books in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write it in hilarious, please?
We don't think it matters.
Nobody understands you the way I do.
Act accordingly.
Do you know how to joggle?
You killed your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I'm not carrying a kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's stopping today.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of riots.
Conference room's busy right now.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mys is not as good as yours.
I'm looking forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You used to say that yourself.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was placed in orbit.
I'm really serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank doesn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He's got a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sympathetic to Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something of this kind.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account must be paid by the first number of the next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You scare her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was a victim of an attempt at extortion.
I can't talk for my colleagues.
Does Tom live far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The resistance ended in a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave a reply.
You chose the wrong person.
They've taken great risks.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If someone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, a cart with mules was on its way.
My grandparents and Tom speak French, and my parents speak English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom wasn't easy to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
I met them here.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is, you lack patience.
Several events marked the coming of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there was no way to talk about it.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow according to schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that languages cannot be confused.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Is there an exam tonight?
What motivates you?
I gave Leila my computer.
Roll your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can become president, but that's probably not true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time is the train coming?
How many times does this train arrive in Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were dating each other.
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him cookies.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think about it.
Put it in French, please.
Get the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Cosy and kill him.
I'll find her.
Did you think of what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers with Tom's.
Tom has a weak heart.
So I'm gonna have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
Which month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't get it at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Does anybody here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He has knowledge of His shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing black clothes.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many broad avenues in this city.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they asleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her come in.
Neighbors complained to us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has shortcomings.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you don't like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
You have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
You're a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
The winter is about to end.
The titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find it?
The meeting was prolonged.
I'll find out.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
Don't you want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Get Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude conduct.
Tom didn't tell me she was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not buying a camera.
I did my best to help Tom.
I connect you to her.
She's got the highest scores.
Tom's gonna make a big deal.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the total jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me paper for notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV this night, I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
The cat's dead.
It's only half the ninth one now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look good.
She put her hands to warm them up.
Tom said it's glad you came back.
My car's covered with blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make that mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I got her to marry him.
I've been waiting all my life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane entered the pusher.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends on correspondence in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Are you going to a concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
- Hi, Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
It hurts.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not match the number of cars going through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
To the attack!
Look at the price card.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new offer as a bottle call, one day they'll transfer it.
You're not going to find a job here.
Can you listen to me a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are related souls.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She started studying in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I suppose you're in my place.
I was planning to do it yesterday.
It's a little early for drinking alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Whoever wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's inexpensive.
Can I get you a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about kissing.
The series needs to start looking when all the seasons are already taken away!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go skiing?
Have you been to the hairdresser?
The prospect is perplexing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a ball pen.
The only way to know what happened was to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everybody knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Will they come too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brakes go.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Come on, Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The whole building was blown up.
Tom kissed Mary, and they were hugging.
It's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks throwing food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's out of the way.
Was it heavy?
He's responding.
I didn't see him nicer.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.
You know the boy who's crying?
Nobody knew about it.
It's amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The stolen pin will steal the cow.
Tom isn't swimming very well, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of the former.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them come in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was gonna come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stay together.
I only heard the good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not gonna be the same to us.
I saw the car blow up.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Pleistish.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase's empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I love going to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm gonna come home tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer told his men to be brave.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like this right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I've made grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everybody knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to pay.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was sceptical.
Tom has to be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I'm rocking every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple sour.
The number of tickets has been limited.
Send me a new catalog.
It must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking a job at the house?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the physics world.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it got on fire.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't apply to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bicycle's gone.
The stars were dying in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
\"Ah, here you are so bored.\" \"My little man, to this world all yearn for...\" — \"Here I am! Your Majesty, Hanon, and his attendants have captured the island of Corida.\" — \"Hmm. What can we do...\" — \"As it is written, only Link can overcome Genon.\" \"So we can...\" — \"Wow! I'll catch his sword!\" — \"Ah?\" — \"Ah?\" — \"The sword is not!\" — \"Towards the skull.\" \"No.\"
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your time going right?
I'll see you at 3:00 on Sunday.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing good.
I met her on the way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everybody knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm on my way to Tom's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed the money.
Tom helped Mary put off her blankets.
A is a number consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He has diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience that you would like to share with us.
Tom slept without blankets.
Pray for us.
What music are you listening to in the car?
They told me three hours ago.
Take me.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to bathe at sea.
It'll be totally dependent on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was enamored.
Nobody saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you normally listen to?
No food without bread.
There'll be snow tomorrow.
You had to quit for a long time.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nubes, and they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they weren't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can go to for help.
I'm stronger than you are.
She was deeply sorry to look back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's go.
They're starting to believe their own lies.
Don't bring him up.
Tom wants to paint his hair.
I haven't seen her here before.
Why do I have to work with Tom?
I think it was your fault.
You think this is the best form of government?
If I tell you how it is, I'll be finished.
Reading is a habit that, once acquired, will never be lost.
Tom can stay in Australia for another week.
There is no one thing in the world that can't teach us anything.
I haven't paid them yet.
Let's hope this is the last time.

This isn't what happened here.
When does your father come home?
I understand.
Tom pulled out Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's a slut.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair's wet with sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom was on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
The boxman is a complimentary master.
Tom's married Mary, isn't he?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got everything working.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I can't hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I was already talking to this student.
What chemical label is known as methyl bromide?
We've got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to the lawyer.
I think you should do it.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The sky is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
You want me to call the cheap one after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could come with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
We ate and left immediately.
There's a big garden in the back of the house.
You're stubborn.
Be careful, don't take anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The calyx was open.
I brought you some wine.
I'm unpopular.
That's his first day at school.
I want to see you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They died.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go on the car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was arrested because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When did you last see her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It should have been you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do this or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears a new shoe.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since he was winter, he didn't go outside.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
Elephant pig's elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
- How's life, Mike? - I'm my name.
Her mother tongue is French.
It's not a finger.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married at the time.
I bought this book.
It is the only positive quality of innovation.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom lived in Boston with a baby.
I didn't eat for six days.
Can I tell them that?
She was quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he says, don't believe him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very friendly, and she's got a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the hummingbirds.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot from them if you only listened.
What should I do in that situation?
I'm sorry to upset you.
The one who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned it on.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get you that well.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
The machine cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said, happened?
Could you leave the door open?
We'll have to wait with this.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that what he's done was a mistake.
Japan has a mild climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mother finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain's gone.
I've never had that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna get out when I called the phone.
I don't have to tolerate this.
Always give up on the road to the right.
We are asked to report in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
An exposed book is on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a song of siren to me.
What does it feel like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting really better.
How do I best get my passport?
You may be able to help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom's not paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom has fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's still light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my dad's car, but it's about to be mine.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I'd do it.
You see Tom's boat?
Is Thomas big?
This drug will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how I was doing?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have anyone to trust.
She's a fan of Seksa in a big city.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Make good contact with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a beer glass after a long day's work.
What was it?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a breath here.
Are you wearing new boots?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She was tasting the makeup when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see?
Tom doesn't like that.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You used to say that yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is almost inconceivable that a scientist at this level would have made such a fundamental mistake.
He doesn't have any proof.

He swimd very well when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't mean to tell you that.
I filled the bushes upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
So you don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Have you been to school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There'll be a lot of snow tomorrow.
We decided to postpone the meeting the next Sunday.

He could sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
You'll get there sometime.
Tom's good with Mary.
- You owe me money. - No, you don't.
He came up and kneel.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Did Tom do this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom makes three times as much money as Mary.
I drank milk.
There'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life great?
When it comes to cooking, no one's gonna compare with Mary.
You haven't been your own lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked a shark.
I'm running it for you.
We'll do it as time goes on.
I'll be three times your age next year.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's a little bit taller than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
That tissue's getting on your skin.
I fell in love with you.
Winter's coming.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were amazed.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.

No wonder, Tom answered.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woke up yet.
Tom's a couple inches taller than Mary.
I'm glad you suggested it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a worldwide language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
Did you not know Tom lived in Boston when he was a child?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why do you want hammers?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
It's split up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give them to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom gave himself the rule of meditation every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress on her.
You're old enough to do it yourself.

Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.

I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.

How unlucky I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He used to speak Russian — at least, he told me that.
Tom's a third-year student.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.

I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.

Thank you for helping me.
We've only got three rules.

Guard didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has had a remarkable record.
I helped carry that bag.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say yet.
My hands are tired.
I was always lying to my wife.
Finally, she succeeded.

I don't know who to consult.
Turn left to corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.

You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.

I wish it was possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play a major role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been tearing seeds all day.
On the other hand, I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercifully!
Tom complied.
All of my generation think about it in the same way.
I live for it.
You know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least they're having fun.

My dad's getting better.
You'll feel like home.
It's not gonna end well!

I didn't ask you to go there.
- Who's Norman Finkelstein-- - American political scientist--
Get the fuck out of here!
So what's this, I'm wondering, if it's not selling goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom got the coin.
Why didn't you leave in your room?
If there is no God, everything is permitted.
Both of us are called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
You still at work?
The new one?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please adjust your belts during takeoff and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'm going to waste too much time explaining why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can I do it differently?
He looks great from here.
Woody houses are easily ignited.
Let's get a party for that.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
It's a very sensitive bed.
I'll do a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a mess.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I eat something?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.

He's inclined to give the will to emotion.
We were shocked to learn of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You just notice the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault that this happened.
It's as good as clocks.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all over the summer.
Let's get him up.
Let's leave this until tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman stopped talking.
A cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't smell anymore.

It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to that kind of weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him steal a snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has hereditary illness.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He's put down the glass.

When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How you doing?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?

Who's gonna believe it?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's screwing his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.

How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They're not on time.
Seven thirty now.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom.
Tom got up early to see dawn.
Dinosaurs died out a long time ago.

I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of hand today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned how to drive.
I'm glad he's not hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like this for a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my feather knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon adjust to the village life.
Hold a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is deeper than anything else.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They died.
Tom and Mary kissed.

I like fruits.
Tom lied.
He trades cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
- I hope he doesn't.
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate eggs.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.

Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you, it's time to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to it.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning hits twice in one place.
I'm not bragging about it.
Leave for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.

Make your own decision.
Were you surprised?

I'd like to go back to Tokyo via Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the application.
You tried to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.

Keep me informed.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom's gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You sort of said it was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't stay late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom's watching a show-up on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep in the street tonight.
That's Tom telling Mary how it's done?
Amazing, isn't it?
I cut my hair.
The school's only five minutes away.
Tom put the spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing that cares about you?
Do you see the rose?
Mary was trying to hide her tears.
Confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a reference.
I lived in Japan three years ago.

Let's go back to lesson three.
Tom's not often at home.
I hope you feel at home.
I'm still waiting.
This soup is delicious, isn't it?
A huge crowd of people were waiting.
There's a bottle in the fridge.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say when he was here.
You really like Tom.
Can you do that for me?
I can do a little bit for you right now.
I'm here because I was asked to come.
Shortly before the explosion, there was a man who was acting suspiciously.
He's sitting with his legs crossed.
I've definitely heard the scream.
Asacus has many foreign tourists.
I wrote it for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's not richer than me.
If only I could tell you!
She's late for the train.
In the summer, I drive to the sea, and in the winter, to the mountains.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
The old man lives alone.
You're so stupid.
He's almost never angry.
You're kind of tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you feel better?
I'll be here on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, Mary on Wednesday.
Are raw eggs safe?
What's the height of Empair State Wilding?
How are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, that's true.
Can we lock that door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you guys doing here?
The police arrested the robbers.
You keep Tom out of the way.
I'm not going to school today.
You two go with me.
Tom was drinking red wine, and Mary was drinking white wine.
I read the article.
It used to belong to them.
He doesn't even notice me.
He is the disgrace of the whole city.
Are you lost?
The pigeon snorts.
That's my favorite.
I don't think anyone has noticed what Tom's doing.
I'm not selling my soul.
It's not my house.
They should've moved fast.
I think you've paid too much for it.
I'll take him.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're higher than all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you know how much trouble you've got?
Could you walk me?
Maria closed her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little bit like a dad.
We never talked about it.
I know what that means.
I had to act fast.
Mary said she'd do it.
Don't you remember me telling you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to doctors in French.
Robots are used to manufacture cars.
Tom's punctuality was never different.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all amazed to see me there.
Drink for my health!
He cut a knife yesterday.
The guy suddenly goes to the folt.
You don't have temperature.
Thank you so much for this information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to do this old one.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't stay here all day.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I visited Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She's not more than sixty years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done this many times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom's really upset about something.
I'll get her right away.
I want to devote this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom's not paying attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building with me.
Don't blame the others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom's burned his fingers about the stove.
They took her.
Mary could have done it if she had tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one, too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I'm thinking about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How about Tom?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
X-ray showed two fingers broken.
Tom said Mary really wanted to eat.
That's why we should have gone there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
We'll wait a little longer.
Laws must be respected.
Tom made Mary wait long.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm doing it for the money.
We just talked about you.
Excuse me, can I count?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary put on two sweaters.
You'll see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to take them to work.
I'm sure he's smart.
What kind of dear should I go?
You were born there?
I'm not listening to that one anymore.
He said it was nine.
The grandmother was flying.
There's no time for that.
Both these bags are mine.
Prices are rising.
She's not wrong.
Today I'm finally going to tell him what I really think of him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love winter.
Show me a picture of her.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom, of course, doesn't think so.
He called me when I was going to bed.
If I can do that, then you can.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
