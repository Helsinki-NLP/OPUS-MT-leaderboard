The Welsh Assembly members do not want to “go on a map”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there will be dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the MWP abbreviation of the Welsh Parliament.
A problematic solution involves plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about the possible jokes with this acronym.
One of the Labourists, expressing his party's view, expressed concern that the new abbreviation was “Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: On the Welsh twp, it means \"tup\" and pwp means \"kaskaka\".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization had generally “remained inadmissible” and had proposed other options.
The conservative party “does not object” to the new abbreviation, but notes that MWP is close to writing to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting a name-change law, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be named will, of course, remain behind them”.
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion survey on the options suggested that the Wales Parliament instead of the Assembles found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the “Members of the Parliament of Wales” option, while the “MWP” version received the greatest public support.
Members seem to be proposing other options, but Elina Jones, the presiding member, will find it difficult to find a solution that is all right, but recall that the draft law on change must be submitted in a few weeks.
Laws on reforms would include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and on the Committee's system.
Members will vote in favour of the final draft of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote to rename the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” includes territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the change of name referendum, stated that he did not intend to acknowledge its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the change in the name of the country is at all costs of EU and NATO accession.
The crisis of the Harlem march: St. Martin's Circle is forever besieged
“The old-fashioned areas I talked to said that I used to have been at every corner of the bar and church, ” says Adams.
“Now there is no one else.”
The disappearance of bars is yet to be understood:
“The format of communication has changed”.
“The Bar has ceased to be a kind of living room all over the area where they came regularly”.
But with regard to the churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter what their leaders say.
In the place of the church, he added, a multi-room house would appear, whose inhabitants would be unlikely to support the remaining visits in the area.
“The majority of the customers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “This will bring about the day when such churches will be finally closed, because new neighbors will never be their inmates.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the arrival in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black arrival in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's Church came into the hands of the black community, she was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a store boycott on 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial artery, where they refused to hire or raise the blacks.
In 1939, the building suffered significant damage as a result of the fire, and in the course of the reconstruction work, Father Johnson was ordered to install a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, who succeeded St. Martin as head of the church, proudly referred to the carillon as \"the stakes of the poor.\"
But an expert who tried the carillon in July called it otherwise: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
The expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the Carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first kind of instrument for playing black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger Caribbean in Riverside Church.
According to Merriweser, St. Martin's church still did not find him replaced.
The last few months around St. Martin’s Church have been a complex situation involving architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting of the delegates, the governing body for the arrival of secular leaders, visited the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese was “trying to transfer the cost of the work” to the host assembly, although the latter did not relate to the selection of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some delegates complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old diver who was fishing for their foreheads.
Official sources reported that a 13-year-old diver was attacked and injured by a shark in California on Saturday, the first day of the brow hunting season.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel explained in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later, he heard a boy screams of help, and together with his friends, they set sail to the scene of the attack and dragged a teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first decided that the boy was very excited about the catch of his forehead, but he quickly “stood that he was yelling - I was bitten!
I was bitten.\"
As he approached the diver, Hammel observed that he had “a completely torn skin around the key”.
“I screamed to get everyone out of the water: ‘ Shark’, ’ says Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rédi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The species of a shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
During the press briefing, the savior, Captain Larry Giles, reported that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago but was not taken to dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the zone from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there were 135 shark species in this area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to conquer the perfumed cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Seinsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfumery units at Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists, based on the model of Luxembourg's department store.
The UK's perfume and cosmetic market is estimated to be £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the areas of fashion and household goods, sales fall, and as an experiment in 11 shops around the country, space divisions of cosmetics and perfumery will be available for capture, and if successful next year, they should be expected in many other shops.
Supermarket owners are looking for ways to fill fields previously placed under television, microwave ovens, goods for home, and investing in the perfume and cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 items, including the names Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of goods being organized in Booths shops.
In addition, the Booty Cosmetics firm line will be reorganized with vegan products to meet the needs of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury stores will present Fragranance Shop perfume makers' kiosks, the first of which is already open in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened at Selli Oak, Birmingham this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food each day in small benches near home have led to supermarkets being forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Seinsbury, says that the tickets will gradually become department stores, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops such as Aldi and Liddle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets house Argos overcoats, and some of them can now find Habitats shops since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, resulting in an increase in food sales and revenues from these purchases.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetic and optical divisions have not been successful.
A joint venture between Seinsbury and Booths was organized in the early 2000s, but there was further disagreement among the participants as to the division of income from sales of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was formulated after the sales of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (all 281 shops) by Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmasi network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of luxuries to care for La Roche-Posay and Vichy skin at four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Seinsbury, \"We've completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumery and cosmetics divisions to create a better environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be willing to assist the council.
We'll have many visitors looking for cosmetics and perfumery, and it'll be a whole new concept of going shopping.\"
Peter Jones responded \"loanly\" to Holly Willoughby's exit from the 11 million pound Sterling deal
The star of Peter Jones' \"Danish\" show was \"fired\" by Holly Willoughby's TV host from the 11 million pounds deal she intended to make with Peter's fake brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint household clothing brand and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to Goop's name by the actress Gwinnet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old lead programme, Etim, announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profit-making lyfstal brands to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV has led to Peter Jones' rage, starring the dragon's liar.
According to our sources, Jones was “enraged” when a TV fan at a heavy meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that she would not have enough time for their common brand of housewear and Truly accessories after the conclusion of new contracts.
Their stamp was compared to the children's actress Gvinette Peltrow with the goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the status of Willoubi, estimated at Pound11 million.
A 37-year-old lead announced her departure to Instagram, but Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree living for the next couple of decades.
Its decision has led to a step-by-step approach for all parties to the transaction.
All were horrified on Tuesday, as there were weeks before the stamp was launched.
At Marlowe headquarters, there was an entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading Etym morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds of sterling because of its considerable supplies, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in starting the line.
In addition, it is a breakdown of long-standing friendships.
Willoubi's three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years now.
Willoubi created the brand Truly along with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company's office in March.
Both couples often take leave together and, in addition, Jones owns 40% of the shares of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will be the ambassador of M&S and will replace Anthony Macportlin as the leading broadcast of ITV, \"I'm Famous.\"
The source from Jones' immediate environment said last night, \"We can't comment on his business.\"
Complex negotiations, “and then we loved each other”
He sought criticism from the media due to the “indecent President” comment and positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the lead's voice.
\"No, I didn't give up.\"
He noted that Kim Jong-yong was interested in a second meeting, after Trump called them the first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, High-level North Korean diplomat Li Yong-Ho made a statement to world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday stating that North Korea was still waiting for a “responsible response” from the United States following the initial DPRK disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“ North Korea is doing great, ” he said.
\"We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could die.
And now we have a wonderful relationship.\"
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-Yun had brought their fruits: the missile tests had ended, hostages had been released, and U.S. soldiers who remained in DPRK had also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong Eun, Trump emphasized that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
\"It is so easy to know how to be a good president, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are breaking into this completely murdered hall, there would be only 200 people here,\" said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Indonesia ' s tsunami and earthquake: catastrophic destruction, victims counted as hundreds
In the early days following the Lambok earthquake, a foreign NHO was told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their roof over their heads, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children prepares a team to be sent to Pala, but we do not yet know if the foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership conducts an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the constant seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still extremely ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, no siren was included in Pala to alert the population, most likely leading to so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The swimming hospital, formerly docked in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, goes to Pala, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and spent little money on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become involved in funding problems.
The President was also criticized for intensifying the interfaith hatred between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands more were deprived of shelter as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, arches with arrows and other suicides.

Cromwell's monument in front of the Parliament called for a heated debate on “rewriting history”
Cromwell's Expulsion would have been well-deserved for the barbarous destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell's Memory Society referred to Mr. Crick's proposal as a “supposition” and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “The ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments inevitably raised the issue of Oliver Cromwell’s statue before Westminster Palace.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English civil wars.
Probably Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived before.
The great statue of Cromwell's authorship by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the view of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, believed Cromwell to be a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case, a monarchy.
Whether that view could be considered historically accurate remains a matter of debate for experts.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that had arisen in the mid-17th century had an impact on the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as the protector Lord are also commendable and respectful.”
China farmer deadlyly gnawed killer pig
At one market in south-western China, a farmer has become a victim of pigs, and local media reports.
The victim's bloody body (the media mention only his last name, Yuan), with a torn artery, was found next to a slut on the market in Lupanshui province of Guizhou in southern China, reported the Morning Post Sunday.
The lead is being trained to introduce pork vaccinations at the pig farm, 30 May 2005, Sinin District of Qinghai Province of China.
The Yuan and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered the breathless body of Yuan, with the door open to a neighboring leader.
There was a huge swine with blood on the rim.
A forensic study found that a pig weighed 250 kilograms [250 kg] of the farmer to die.
\"My brother's feet were bloody and mutilated,\" reported the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the deceased.
The video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed their animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
Killer pig didn't belong to brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that pigs were isolated during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuany family is reported to negotiate with the market administration about compensation for the death of the farmer.
Swine attacks on people often occur.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal plunged a Welsh farmer into a tractor and let go, only in fear of a ripe wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the U.S. was eaten by his own pigs, as a Canadian farmer told the BBC News Channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood tastes can act on their hidden aggression as a “lethal mechanism”.
\"Smalls,
They're biting and very curious, but they're not meant to hurt you.
You should just instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring torrents to much of the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is said to be losing strength by moving through an area with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days, it will bring flooding and flooding into northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
On Saturday, 5 a.m., in New York City, the cyclone reached the 1st category with wind up to 135 km/h, 360 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the hurricane will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone that will travel east to the west coast of the United States begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, near the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity that has hit the emerging low pressure zone is expected in the coming days in the South-West.
Rainfalls between 2.5 and 10 cm will generate dangerous torrential floods, muddy streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, rainfall can reach a rate of 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical air humidity.
In selected areas of the south-west of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapid-development floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
At the present risk of tropical flooding, walking in the wilderness has serious consequences.
Lavni can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause bursting winds and lift up clouds of dust.
As a low-pressure zone emerges, torrents will collapse on the coast of southern California.
There may be up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small muddy streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and morning in Arizona, tropical rains will take place, spreading to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the torrents will be in the area of the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
During October, sharp temperature drops will be observed throughout the United States, owing to the low Arctic air temperature at high enough temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination results in severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De-Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and extend to other areas.
For most of the central and eastern United States, warm weather is expected in early October and temperatures will be as high as 27 degrees in the South plains to the North-East of the country.
In New York City, air temperatures can rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises a high probability of an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by the middle of October.
Judge Bretta Cavanaugh, Senate hearing over 20 million spectators
The statements of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blazi Ford, who accuses Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, were brought to the attention of over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation over the confirmation of the Kawano candidacy was followed by an emergency message on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake made a condition that charges against a lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at her hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she is “100 per cent” sure that Kavano, in a state of intoxication, attacked her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, claiming that he was 100 percent sure he wasn't there.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the Friday debate saw over 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average statistical data from the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences in other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
Furthermore, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account the viewers watching TV at work.
In comparison, this is the average audience watching an American football play in a play-off or an Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was in Fox News Channel, whose leaders were passionately supportive of Cavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearing, which lasted the entire day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported the Nielsen Agency.
The second place is ABC, with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the matter is far from weak.
On Friday there was a real drama with Jeff Flake.
After the senator from Arizona, who is considered to be a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the Qawano candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to lock on the camera as Flake encountered an elevator on Friday morning to meet the Legal Committee with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him drop his eyes and receive a blow-up from angry women on CNN live air.
“I am standing in front of you, ” said one of them.
“Do you think he's telling the country the truth?”
“For you, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position to women.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator door closed, the senator's vaulting of the cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was ready to confirm the nomination of Kavano as a judge and to send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast live.
However, Flake made one condition — that the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority was seeking.
Flake claims to have changed his mind through the intervention of a friend, a senator from Democrats Chris Kons.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was evident that Republicans lacked votes to confirm Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened investigations into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses his critics of “political games” about the situation with Brittany
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accusing politicians who criticize her plan to leave the European Union of placing narrow-party interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister attends a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.

On Friday, Baton Rouge, the Crown of the East, issued a pre-trial detention: the death was caused by a cross-sectional wound to the neck and head.
The Division thanks the Criminal Investigation Division of the State of Louisiana Police, the State Police Criminal Sciences Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the locals who assisted in the operational and investigation activities that led to the detention.
Joe Allevy, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “lucky work of taking over a criminal”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-metre forward was from Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, was also on the team of the University of Louisiana.
During the past season, Sims picked 5.6 points and made 2.6 sets, on average, for a match.
Team trainer Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims caused “shocks” and“ real woe ” from all players.
“That’s what I always feared, ” added the coach.
Volcano Covered Mechico Peplom
Popocatepetl fell asleep in the ashes of the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population not approach the volcano; its crater recorded activity and produced 183 megagas emissions per day.
According to the Centre, shivering and shivering were common near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social networking users have published pictures of loose-walled cars.
Following the 7.1 Mw earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded a regular volcanic activity 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) volcano has been in operation since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists in advance of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, a multi-monthly meeting was held in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps, without clashes between autonomy supporters and police officers; six rioters were detained.
The police held back the protesters of independence, while the latter black masked the order of eggs and powdered paint, raising the clouds of dark dust at the heart of Barcelona.
After the police went into the process of containing the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
Over the course of a few hours, independence advocates had scandalized: “We won’t forget, we won’t be easy!” and their opponents answered with the slogan, “To time indefinite Spain!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were admitted to a hospital with light injuries.
A referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain was held on 1 October last, and it was found illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists.
Catalonia voted enormously in favour of the withdrawal from Spain, but the appearance was low due to the fact that the opponents of the withdrawal mostly boycotted the referendum.
In the past year, almost 1,000 persons were injured in police attempts to block a referendum at the country ' s polling stations in violent clashes, according to reports from Catalan official sources.
On Friday, separatists took the stated route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from being carried out.
The demonstration was still taking place, but it took a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who had visited the rally of separatists in his wife's company, said that the hope of accommodating sovereignty by Catalonia was increasing.
“The last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents wept for happiness, given the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December elections for local government, the Catalan parties, in favour of separation from Spain, have won an important victory, albeit with a small break, but this year their movement is losing its supporters, as many of the famous leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic writing to a police rally phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
\"The tension is growing,\" he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Jounkeras, one of nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who had been detained in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the regular European Parliament elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish Government,” he says.
Londoners: car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was a motor vehicle, and the men in London were arrested for 33 years, 34 years, and 39 years.
The visit took place on Thursday, about 19:30 a.m. local time in the Ballinagard area of Cressent.
The taran resulted in damage to the gate and the building itself, reports the Inspector of Criminal Police Bob Blemmings.
There's reports that a bow shot could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's remarkable goal
The first goal of Dolly Menga was a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
With the shot-up, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers, which is only 18 games in the middle of the Scottish club coach, Steven Gerardo.
The exact impact of Dolly Mengui compared Gary Holt's team to the Hibernian Club in the pensitorial table where they share the second place.
The Gerardo Club was left on its way out this season of the Premier League, and on Sunday, they have a meeting with the leaders of the group, the Harts, from which Rangers lag for eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will conduct a match between the League of Europe and the Austrian Rapid (Vienna) Club in their field.
The Livingston Club continues its win-win series in the Division, playing six games, and has not received any defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the chief coach of the team.
Losing moments for Livingston in a shelter with visiting guests
Holt's supportive coaches were supposed to keep an account from the very beginning — the Rangers clearly failed to meet their demands.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt did not come out, and then advocate Alan Litgow couldn't stop the Kaig Halkett ball from getting on the network.
The host party allowed Rangers to play ahead of their line of defence, counting on the security moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers took a free strike, and Livingstone took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer of Menge, which killed him from the central position.
By that time, Rangers had been superior to the ball, but the defense of the receiving team was unprovoked, so brother Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time was in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to beat Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers gateman, Allan McGregorgor, shot the ball off Scott Pittman and made a wide distribution from the standard position.
With it all the time, Livingston was in the fine, but all of the attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the toolbar — one for provoking Glenn Middleton Halkett's reserve player and the other for playing with his hand — were not met.
Livingstone Phenomenal Game - Analysis
From BBC Scottland to Alader Lamont, a report from the Toni Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the players were brilliant and once again they exceeded all the expectations, continuing to rise to football Olympics.
Their style of playing and composition has remained virtually unchanged since they came up with the top line of ratings, and it is the great credit of the Holt coach that he has mobilized the team from the very beginning.
His team had a lot of real heroes.
Captain Halkett led a brilliantly organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they have had good playtimes with coach Gerard, this time they have failed to meet our expectations.
In the last few minutes of the match, they lacked the sword, and only once they could pass the defense of the receiving team. The Rangers, down in the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Refrigerated reception of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, it was a beautiful weather, and the two top men were in a good mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan ' s visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO participating countries, a visit that was already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of country were unable to find understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the ceremony for the opening of a huge new mosque.
There is the largest Turkish diaspora in Cologne outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from entering the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters were stationed nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including Kurdah, gathered to condemn fully both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The radically opposite viewpoints of the meeting reflect the mixed nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots outnumber Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Crash: A collision with a car resulted in the death of a cyclist
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossroads in the south-east of Depport, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulances arrived were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died without consciousness.
This is not the only fatality accident in the area: only one mile and a half from the scene, in Childers Street, another rider was killed by a vehicle whose driver was hiding.
The London Police reports that work is under way to identify the deceased and to notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads were closed and buses were being routed at the scene, and motorists were being asked not to enter the area.
Impairment in Long-Lartin prison: six police officers injured
According to Long-Lartin Administration, six police officers were injured during riots in the men ' s security prison.
The men's prison of the Long-Lartin (Woostershire) regime has been in conflict since Sunday, which has been inundated around 09:30 local time.
The Tornado Operation Group was called to suppress the disturbances involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
Police were slightly damaged by the soft tissue of the person; they were provided with medical treatment on the ground.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specifically trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long-Lartin correctional facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for longer periods.”
Long-Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been taken to a hospital, under attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special forces to calm the broken-up prisoners who had thrown their billboards at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the area of the intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is fortunate: at the beginning of the following week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last leap, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring about the risk of torrential floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of torrential floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern state of Nevada, in the south-east of California and Utah, including in such cities as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a straight line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and will spill out on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service Office in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm status or depression at a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) has traveled 65 kilometres from the border of Arizona.”
Recent projections of the National Meteorological Service show a drop of between 5 and 10 cm, reaching 15 cm in the Arizona Mogolon-Rome Plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rockies Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible that as much as 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation will fall, where precipitation can be as high as 10 cm.
For areas that will be bypassed by the party, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, since the region has long been suffering from drought.
While torrential floods may pose a danger, heavy rains can facilitate a dry season not taking place in the South-West.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory has been subject to at least severe droughts (the second most serious category),” reports theweather.com website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the state of Lower California in Mexico.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is located 360 kilometres south of the town of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane was found in an area with cooler water on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of tropical storm.
It is expected that in certain areas of Mexico there will be abundant rainfall threatened by floods.
“The area from Lower California to north-west Sonora may fall to between 7 and 10 cm, up to 25 cm,” reports the Web siteweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then head north through Mexico and return to the border with Arizona on Tuesday morning in the tropical cyclone, and it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The ultimate potential risk of Hurricane Rosa and its remains is severe flooding in Lower California, north-west Sonora and in desert areas of the south-west of the United States”, reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that rainfall will result in dangerous torrential floods, muddy torrents in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects arrested for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old suffered severe stab wounds, suspected of attempted murder by three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy.
A victim of a serious injury was found in the Exelsior Terrace area of the city of Midsomer Norton about 4 a.m. Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as stable.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock district, reporting to the Avon and Somerset district police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime with any video of what happened on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: \"Cavano has broken down all hatred, all malice is Democrats\"
“The voice behind Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” said Trump at the meeting of his associates in Wiling, West Virginia.
In Trump's view, in the process of approving the Kavano nomination, the Democratic Party had “abated all the hatred, all the malice”.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified to the U.S. Congress, in his emotional appeal categorically rejecting Christine Blazi Ford's accusation that he had sexually made her well over 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her prosecution hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage of Kavano.
“The voice for the approval of Judge Kavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unblemished public record,” announced the president of the crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President implicitly raised the issue of the nomination of Cavanaugh, referring to the importance of Republicans appearing for the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives remain for only five weeks.
I don't participate in them, but I'm also involved in a race in a different sense,\" he said.
“I wear it as a burn-and-fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task “to exert our utmost resistance”.
Under the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate for the approval of the Qawano can be held no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party was informed.
Indonesia ' s earthquake has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, and many had been killed by giant waves that captured the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in Palu City, and on Friday, waves nearly six feet [6 m] high filled the west coast, laughing all over the way and causing many of them to die instantly.
The tsunami followed the earthquake of a magnetic 7.5 along the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of immediately fleeing to safety and lost their lives,” reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office during a press conference in Jakarta.
“There was no one, no one, there were cars in the stream, a log, whole houses, and nothing in the way,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and hit the coast with all force.
Some of those present were taken to trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pala.
The aerial photography of disaster management shows destroyed homes, shops, bridges and a flooded mosque.
Saturday, the coastal city was still shaking underground.
A series of earthquakes took place in the Territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The report of the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake-produced energy emissions were about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected at the expense of the geographic location of the city at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Nugroho referred to the damage as “scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the deceased were found under the ruins of the buildings that had collapsed, with 540 injured, and 29 others missing.
Nugroho added that casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 km from Palo, in the place of Dungal, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications from Dungal were “completely destroyed, no information received”.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungal area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already entered the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not a limit,” the report states.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized for failing to report the tsunami in Pala, but the authorities believe that waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
Social media has produced amateur videos in which a man on the top floor of the building screams about the tsunami coming, desperately trying to attract the attention of people in the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water breaks over the shore, bringing together whole homes and cars.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and the tsunami led to a massive roundup of electrolines, causing Pala to lose contact, which made it very difficult for the rescue services to do so.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, and government sources report.
The city ' s airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pala.
The number of tsunami casualties in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungla in Pala, where the staff found shelter in tarpaulin tents that were broken into the courtyard of their office building.
“They have seen a great multitude of destroyed homes,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put humanitarian assistance mechanisms in place, but many complain that experts from the international NCB have not been able to reach Pala.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign workers only after declaring the site where the country ' s natural disaster has struck.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed to be a local disaster,” says Aria Ariani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As only the Government will declare a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but the status remains unchanged so far.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the missing people still look forward to their miraculous salvation, which will restore faith to the better.
On Saturday, a small boy who fell into a sewer hatch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman from the debris, who spent two days there next to her mother's breathless body.
Hendon Subandano, a Indonesian national paraplaner for paraplanetism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped at Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s difficult to survive emotionally,” he said.
Hendon recalls learning of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel by other paraplaneters that he had spent the following hours trying desperately to reach out to whatsApp to his colleagues in Palo who rest at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with a single gray-head, not two blues.
“This means that the communications have not been delivered”, he considers.
Trick theft $26,750 during banking service in Newport-on-Liwi
On Friday morning, the attackers kidnapped 26,750 dollars from Incassor Brink's managing one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Livie, says in a press release by the Newport Police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured microbus was taking cash from the entertainment company's ATM and was about to fill it with new bills.
During this time, \"Brink's employee came running off his back\" and stole bags of bankers' bills.
Incident witnesses reported that several suspects had fled the scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
The citizen who has any information on these persons is requested to contact the Newport Police Office at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Yee.
Repper Kanje West came up with a new name for himself:
On Saturday, he announced, on Twitter, “The manhood formerly known as Kanya West”.
The 41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym, even putting it in the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
News of this appeared in anticipation of Kanje's presentation of Saturnday Night Live, where he plans to introduce his new Yandhi album.
Kanya West will speak in lieu of Ariana's singer, who cancelled her participation on account of “emotional concerns”, reports the author of the transmission.
West had stated earlier that the pseudonym was not only a shortened version of his name but also made religious sense.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’re’,’ so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with a radio director, Big Boy.
\"I mean you, I'm us.
First was Kanya, which means alone, and now I'm just Ye, which is the reflection of all the good, bad, intelligible in us, just at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.\"
Kanje is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deddy, Pi Diddy, or just Diddy, this year asked to call himself Lav (\"love\") or Braz Lav (the \"brotherly Love\" or \"brotherly Love\").
The rapper J-Z, who spoke with West, also changed his name several times: with a defis and without, with capital letters, or with string letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against civilians
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration ending in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never resort to military assistance to suppress the Mexican people”.
At this point, on 2 October 1968, the first shots on the crowd were fired and 300 lives were massacred during a peaceful demonstration of students, and this was due to the increase in left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of learning prospects brought young people straight into the criminal world.
United States dollars must be doubled in funding for the development of the IA.
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence (II) — the United States should double its investment in its scientific developments, according to Lee Kaifu, an investor and an enterprise in IA development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries had previously made statements about IA, although the US as a whole did not have a clear IA development strategy.
At the same time, China had submitted its own plan as early as the previous year: its goal was to become the first to become an IA innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for IA research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind in the United States, and we look forward to the next IA breakthrough,” says Lee.
Increased funding could double the chances that the next major achievement of IA would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Super-Powers of Art: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director-General of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in U.S. Hotel and then led Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, for example, the Robotics Challenge Agency Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that graphing should automatically be offered to candidates in the area of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
China ' s National Natural Sciences Foundation allocates funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which should involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee on Art Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI Next program.
With regard to the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million per year in research into the IA.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on a referendum on Sunday on whether the name of their country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would permit a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and EU.
In June, both Governments entered into an agreement based on a new name proposal, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would be at a minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was: “Do you support membership in NATO and EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged since the fall of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for admission to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievsky, resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would follow the outcome of the voting to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says the 62-year-old José Tanevski, an elector from Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are a member of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our high-rise heads, rather than the doorsteps of business offices,” says Kawadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zayev said that membership in NATO would result in investments in Macedonia, which was so much needed by that country, where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be for the reasons that more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” stated hed after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “the key to our future. ”
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required occurrence.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to be positive.
For a referendum to take place, the appearance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, of Manchester City, bypasses Briton's defense to kill a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were massacred with the protection of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 Saturday at the Tihad stadium in Manchester, England.
When Agüero scored his goal at 65, it seemed like he had done nothing to do with it.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field.
He swung between three Briton defenders before breaking out into open space.
Agüero found himself surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders and ransacked several others at the edge of the Briton penal zone.
He then handed the Sterling ball to the left.
The English attacker, while in the penal zone, single-faced the ball of Aguero, who right-handedly pierced Matthew Ryan's brother-in-law in the right-hand corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said journalists coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Heavenly Blues an initial advantage in the fight against the Premier League.
That goal was shot at 29th.
In this game, Aguero received the ball deep inside Briton
He gave an excellent cut gear over the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sune made a couple of touches before handing Sterling over to the long pants.
The attacking Heavenly Blues killed the ball in the gate just before it flew outside the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in the League of Champions group on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckcar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take points from Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals left the battle for playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Scherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rociz is ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in Western Division, there will be problems in playoff.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night was already won, at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to secure the title in the first Division.
“And while we're playing just like this, at least we can hold positions, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver is very important in the presence of spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss such a thing?\"
Nationals has not yet announced a pitcher on Sunday, but, according to recent data, it is in the current situation that Scherzer is inclined to play that role.
Scherzer, who's going to go out on the 34th game, throws a ball on Thursday at the pitcher's seat, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'll be a drinker.
Washington Government Training Statistics - 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 rating and 300 auts at 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republicans' appearance in the interim elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks remain for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important, I'm not running, although I'm really running around fighting for good candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: \"You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means we need, and we are witnessing immorality and indecency.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, through whom they have to cross to gain power and control, and that is what they want — power and control, but we're not going to give them away.\"
The Democrats, he claims, have sought “to resist and hinder”.
“And you have observed this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wicked, mean, mean, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee by referring to Democrat Diane Finestein, which caused loud voices from the hall.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow this document to leak?
Mmm... mm... what document?
I have never seen the language of the body so contradicting the words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with differing views.
It does not tolerate opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party made a proposal for a voodoo of mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of Parliament of the Labour Party, who have not yet been told that we are not welcomed for our views.
A similar attitude toward my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my unbelief with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe’s irony are issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly notification on Friday stated that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time, of the eight years I had served as a local member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC Friday meetings were the same evening.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not consistent with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more apparent, and each view is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak in public — no matter what I say — there are insults on social networks that call for the abolition of elections condemning the centre's policies or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just about me.
Indeed, I know that I have been fortunate enough to be more than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who each day face a stream of sexual or racist assaults but never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that the number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church, ” and with every dent, mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes a reality.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations that encourage me to sit down and speak down, and then I'll be fine.
But I didn't come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a school student who was outraged by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which caused my school class to literally fall apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — either the local deputy or the government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who have supported this note on Friday: my country is moving so hard for Brexit, which will be sure to bring economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the wish of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience to which I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are Labourists or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats to the abolition of election results or political utility will prevent me from acting as I think necessary in your interest.
Chris Leslie, a member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Er comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final outcome somewhat, but no doubt Er earned triumph in this amazingly interesting Tennant Prime League match.
Now they're leading the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, thus giving Peter Merchi the full right to be content with the host team and coach.
“All this time has been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” commented Peter Merchi.
Robin Christie, Melrose: \"It is to pay tribute to Er, they have tried better than us.\"
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Klimo led the Er to the front, but the yellow card released for the Warorce game by the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott took hold of an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased the Er break from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, he earned a point and then, on a break, made a single attempt to account 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt at Baggots reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruard Knott, who had suffered from the meltdown, and after a second release, Er moved further thanks to the attempt by Climo Stafford McDowell.
Acting Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the opponents to pay another player for a failed attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a period of intense pressure.
Nevertheless, the masters returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball with a penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the onset molla \"Er\".
Klimo enjoyed the advantage of not stopping almost from the most re-emergence, after Kyle Rowe had received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme of the attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the leaders of the field.
Star Still Game is about to start a new career in restaurant business.
The Still Game Ford Kieran star is about to start work in the hotel industry, and he is now known to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the scenario he writes to, and takes off with Greg Hemfield's long-standing comedy partner.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last one on the show, and it seems as if Kirnan was planning a life after Craiglang.
Officially, he is the Director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although Scottish Sun’s source hinted that Kirnan was planning to participate in a “whelming restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia’s landlocked land hopes that the Court will once again open its way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags have been placed in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan, \"More is our right.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
There was still a memory of Chile ' s coastline, lost in favour of the 19th century in the bloody conflict because of resources; a lively and eager flow of resources across the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia looks forward to the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and balance of mind and, of course, is looking forward to a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile will have an obligation to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who has fought hard to re-election next year, is also anxious to see a decision to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, that will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands had no authority to administer Chilean territory and had already stated that it would have no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard showed that the case was “no more complex”, says Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
The past four years have not moved forward, but rather have been postponed all the time.
“The National Authority of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” says Zarathe.
She said that Morales ’ military rhetoric had destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Chile and Bolivia will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss thereafter.
The two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the decision of the court was too fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity “to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit”, he argues.
It also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, uses the naval problem as a political assailant.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he argues.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to run through our past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho declares that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it trusts Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually reverts to the path of the resumption of dead nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-yong.
Ri argues that the dream that a long United States sanctions and an objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever be a utopia.
Washington feared approval of the declaration if Pyongyang had not taken significant steps towards disarmament before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
However, skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows the newest line of massive head coverings that promise to be sold in the mass market, and they will be worn right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, there's no need to look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a mass of unusual head coverings that were part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, highly impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snogging creations to the podium.
Valentino’s cast copy: The main beige, decorated with broad featherlike fields, was painted on the head of the models.
Other massive accessories included precious stones of arbus, a Wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headwear were not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also presented the world with a collection of shabby masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these sharp masks had their mouth stitched, and they were more like the portrait of Hannibal Lectare than the creation of an angler.
One was like an underwater floating machine with a tube and protective beams, and the other was a melting ice cream.
If you're a big fashion fan, you're lucky.
The fashionable critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into the mass market — right to you.
The huge-sized hats follow the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with two feet wide, which was already worn by everything, from Ryanna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultile label, which produced this highly impractical hat, won such widespread popularity on social media, gave birth and sent out another huge axessuar — a straw beach bag almost as large as the bathing model that carries the bag.
The orange bag of the deified rafía with a white leather handle and a rafía tip was a bright copy of the Jacobus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
\"I think big hats and beach bags will be sold in the next summer.\" Since the designer has made such a fur in his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.\"
John Edward: The knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue to be a tradition of brilliant education, once again confirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland are enrolled, and these schools seek to provide higher levels of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their career as well as their status as citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak to a person in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, you are drawing to his heart.\"
This is a strong indication that we cannot rely only on English if we want to have relations with and trust in citizens of other countries.
In recent exams this year, we see that languages are the leading players in league tables and have the highest score in independent school examinations.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils studying foreign languages received the highest A score.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils received A in Mandarin (Chinese language) while 72 per cent of students studied German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish, also received A.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects use the same demand as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacant jobs were lacking in language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a key to a successful future career for young people.
Given the fact that more forward-looking jobs require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession the student will choose if he learns the second language, in the future he will have a real advantage by acquiring another skill that will benefit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who is familiar with several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov involving more than 4,000 adult British, 75 per cent failed to speak enough in foreign language to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a double percentage speaking 15 per cent.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant now.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scottish schools there is a wide gap in languages, and each school has its own set of languages.
Some schools focus in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain in the light of the future of the country until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always choose from several languages with teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages are still vital for the future development of the country, and should therefore be adequately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director, Independent School Board of Scotland
Lebron debuts Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The dark expectation of fans to see Lebron James for the first time at Los Angeles Lakers almost came to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the pre-session Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still needs to know how much time he'll have to play.
\"More than one and less than forty-eight,\" Walton replied at the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six \"Leakers\" pre-session games.
“At this stage in my career, I don’t need pre-session games to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
Trump's pre-election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled Trump meetings next week, including the friendly Tennessee and Mississippi meetings.
As the vote on the candidate proposed by him to the Chief Justice was postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia going to take place tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wiling, West Virginia will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week ' s hearing to appoint his candidate, Brett Kavano, to the post of Chief Justice, and Trump ' s proposal has generated a mass of negative reactions, as Kawano was charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be taken in the Senate will be postponed until the week as the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase the electoral pace.
Thus, the President Trump campaign aims to ensure that the five meetings to be held next week help “enact the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“The Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense period of electoral agitation,” reports the press secretary of Trump’s campaign, who refused to be called, reports Reuters.
The action planned today in Wesbanco Arena in Wiling can attract supporters from “Ogayo and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburg media, ” reports West Virginia Metro News.
A visit by the West Virginia Trump on this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, which was where he won the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“The fact that Morrisi has begun to outstrip his interview competitors must come to the President is not a good sign for Morrisi himself,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (reuters quoted).
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. camper shows a willingness to fight and gives hope by going to even competitions on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, a Saturday two-to-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transition initiative is an exceptional fictional sport concept, but it is the players who believe in it, and at such competitions it is particularly strong.
So who's got the initiative?
“They had a six point advantage, and now there are four, so I suppose this is a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Speth.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve-point advantage.
The Americans, according to Spita, feel “wind in the sails”, and they have reason to hold the spirit high, not least because of the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas playing together all day long, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleep was inviolable from you to the pomegranate you set a personal example.
The winning slogans became louder as his round continued, bringing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas entered two by two.
His blow to win the 15th hole was met with a similar message, one that says about his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to meet with all our efforts and focus only on our own game,” commented Speth.
That's all that's left to play with.
18 moons pass and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinarie and Tommy Flintwood, who are undoubtedly part of the Ryder Cup story.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know any mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who had not received the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the non-scientific fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be won on Sunday, and when the sun is hidden beyond the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player behind Europe’s potential victory than Flintwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both were simultaneously on different moons.
However, it is still premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly massacred Sergio García, the morning hero of a four ball game when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine moons dug a Spanishman and led a pit from which they could never climb.
So on Sunday, no one's gonna help you get out of your pit.
So it's exciting to watch four ball and four player games because of the interaction between the couples they exchange and those who deliberately miss and how the strategy can change for one moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and moved forward a great deal on the last day, but this session of the Quartet has also shown that the assembled United States has every strength to fight in which some, particularly in America, have questioned.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe is in charge of 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup, following the Saturday match of four balls and fours, with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet Tommy Flintwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the Fighting Tiger Woods in order to bring the score in \"Le Golf National\" to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to bring back the trophy lost in Haselltin two years ago, dominated the supposed mistake of the American team in the morning game of four, winning a three-per-one score.
The two games won more resistance in the fours, but they failed to close the gap in the account.
Jim Ferik's team needs eight points out of the 12 games to keep the trophy.
Flintwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname Mollywood after the sensational weekends, were only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then united perfectly to defeat the fallen spirit of Woods and American novice Bryson Dechebmo with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who passed the two Saturdays, showed periodic glimmers, but now he lost 19 out of 29 to four and seven to seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who was resting in front of a four-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner, Henrik Stanson, in four, winning Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepk, with a score of 2/1 in the world's first and third seats.
For Europe, though, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk of refreshing the day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-fold champion Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set two points for Americans on Saturday.
They made a decisive victory with the score of 2/1 over the Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to play Polter and Rory Maquillroy on the four-thirds account, losing the first two moons.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team got out of a four-point lag, coming out alone, given that Ferika's team, as hosts, had to play a trap to keep track of the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “categorised” will not disarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as cessation of nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of nuclear weapons and the undertaking not to increase nuclear weapons and develop nuclear technology.
“One symmetrical reaction from the United States we do not observe,” he said.
“With no confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able unilaterally to take action on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated the North Korean complaints that Washington was opposed to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Eun and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then, Kim promised to move towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls for the weakening of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that ‘the market must be denuclearized,’ and it increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal forcibly and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of war,’ ” says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that the continued sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump summit, which the leader of the United States had mentioned at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae Inn over the past five months and added: “If the denuclearization issue had been a party to that issue, South Korea would not have been such a deadlock in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”.
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech differed sharply from that of last year when he told the UN Genossamble that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide rocket”.
This year, at the UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures last year, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not specify any time period for the process: “Is it going to take two years, three years, or five months? It does not matter”.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and compulsoryly until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut funding for Pyongyang programmes on nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri in the United Nations General Assembly fists and reported after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of the visit, North Korea condemned him for “banditous demands”.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, took “appropriate measures”.
According to Kim, he was told that “the appropriate measures” he had referred to were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest in Special Courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all students of elementary school to learn more sleep and to combat the chauvinist culture of unending caffeine consumption in order to keep up the night.
One academic found that the world’s most successful students often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was lit up with the idea of introducing such a course, pre-reporting on the impact of sleep deficiency on learning processes.
\"At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, 'I'm really sorry I only learned about it now that I'm almost finished with my studies.'\"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course for the first time offered to students this year describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports achievement, as well as how it improves a person's common feelings.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service of the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the school week.
The task lasts one hour, and the students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of the class, we are provided with a picture of a room in a dormroom where students who click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books are provided with information on how each of these activities and substances — the coffee, the light that causes sleep shortages — affect sports performance and how important it is to receive sufficient sleep daily.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The online campus map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change students’ behavior at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know how and any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health, ” added Professor Chaisler.
He said that the false sense of pride that a person could “push all night ” was still relatively common, and modern technology, as well as the increasing pressure on students, meant that sleep deprivation was becoming a problem.
He said that sufficient sleep of good quality is a “secret weapon” for a student to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, since undersmoking moves his brain into hunger, making him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californicist studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to attend a similar training program before entering a competitive training institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students install a alarm to prevent sleep and wake up and remember the harmful effects of the blue light produced by electronic screens and LED lamps that disrupt a person's biorhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Hall Mengo brings victory over Gerard's team
Rangers survived another sad retreat, as Dolly Meng's goal led Stephen Gerard's unselected team to defeat a 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Aybrox team hoped to win their first victory on the exit after winning the 4:1 score in February in St. John, but the Gary Holt team only defeated Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving easy victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, the spirit’s lost strength, seemed not to equal the score.
While Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to the third, and only Hibernian gave in to the ratio of the heads who had been killed.
And Rangers may have further problems after line Judge Kaluma Spence had to heal the wound on his head after some item had been thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements on the team that passed through the Air to the semi-final for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, had followed the same strategy of Libya 11, which had widened the Harts gap last week, and he would be glad to see his well-flavored composition chased his opponents on every move.
Rangers may have been led by the sword, but Livingstone was pushed out much more when the ball hit them.
They were to forget the goal in just two minutes, when the first transmission of Menga Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGreghorn, but the semi-protector took advantage of the chance.
Keegan Jacobs performed a fine strike on the captain of Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to put the ball in the direction of the long-distance pants.
Rangers took control, but the last third seems to have had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident that he should have struck a punitive blow at the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
Rangers made only two strikes in the first time, but Aybrox's former warden, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Kulibali's blow with his head, and the weak blow of Ovi Ejariya.
Although Libya's first goal, which may not have been appropriated by the 34th minute, is not a game, no one can deny that they have earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' standard playing.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying hard to turn the ball to Menga for completion.
Gerrard took action in the middle of an interruption when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and the replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme semi-protector handed over to the Ambassador of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly swung from his line to the intercept.
But Livingstone continued to involve the guests in the game with Litgou and Halkett, which they had always made long broadcasts.
Holt's team was trying to increase the opening in the final stages, but McGonagall was able to block Jacobs before Litgo gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
The late Rainers, Glenn Middleton, again demanded a fine strike after he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Geiger Accountant
And now the page of our Almanac on \"The Resurrection Morning\" was born on 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Being one of the foundations of science, Geiger’s enumerator has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s Colloquial Coronado film, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — perhaps not like scientists — in their primary roles:
Man: What the hell is this thing?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms, which is caused by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: \"That's right, now! \"
Geiger's Gans died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anomalous cells
A new anti-smoking vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
A part of the cure is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and modify them under laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells are given the ability to “visit” the protein type characteristic of many cancers, then the cells have to be re-entered
A sample vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalous cells has had ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and modify them in the laboratory, after which the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, National Cancer Research Institute, Wifzekzek, Maryland, states: “The results we received are hinting, and we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was used successfully in the treatment of leukemia, which was to take away immune cells from patients and “learning” how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanye West spoke in defense of Trump in MAGA's cap after his appearance in SNL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was released at the studio during the Saturday concert, at which he spoke in defence of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming that he would re-take the position in 2020.
After performing his third song, entitled “The City Ghost, ” which he played with the cap “The Making of America the Great Again”, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, ‘ How can you support Trump, he’s a racist? ’
Well, if I were concerned about the issues of racism, I would have left America for a long time,” said the performer.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in a central role in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
TV did not show how the crowd resented West's statement, but the video was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West fun of this step now.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mocked by the scenes by his hat.
\"They've been kidding me over the stage.
They say don't get in that cap.
They were really kidding me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, \"And they said my position was not cool.\"
West goes on to say, \"Do you want to know what's not cool, put on a superman's cloak, so that no one can tell you what you need to do, or do you want the world to continue to grow?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of SNL's acting staff seemed to be lost, and one person said: “The whole studio has been strung into silence.”
West was invited last time to replace Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, MacMiller's rapper, died a few days earlier.
The performance of West song \"I Love it\" in Perrier's costume has been a challenge to many.
West has received support from the head of the TPSA Conservative Group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the boldest people: SERVANT FOR MNOGHT.”
The lead talk show Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that West was just \"who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful.\"
“One thing I don’t want to support is anyone (buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation), who, in my opinion, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,\" she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now \"formally known as Kanya West.\"
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Paff Daddy, Poffey and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Doga originally named Snoop Lyon, and, of course, the other example is the artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as the Prince (Prince).
Attempted murder on account of a knife at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballihakare, as reported in the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Keith Harington's Star of Thrones attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is well-known for his role as sword-whisker John Snow in the cruel medieval fantasy HBO Game of Thrones.
Nevertheless, a recently 31-year-old actor bitterly criticized the stereotype of a masculinist hero, saying that such characters often make young people think that it is necessary to be cruel to be respected.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said that he felt that something had gone wrong, and he wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the movie “The Game of Thrones”, Rose Leslie, her peers, admitted that he was“the most indifferent” to the problem.
“I take the question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the sense of courage?” asks the actor.
“What do we teach young people that we have such a problem to date?”
The whale believes that television can be partly responsible for this surge of toxic courage due to too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they have to show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think that's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today, with young people, something's really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the qualms or screeches of the Game of Thrones, after the show ended the next summer, claiming that he had “conquered with bats and horses”.
Since November, Keith has played a major role in Sam Shephard, the newly filming \"The Truth West\" of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting Rose's wife is the best finale of the Games of Thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life,” says the actor.
Rose played the Isthmus, an object of passion for the character of Keith John Snow in the fantasy series of Emma's awards.
The couple noted the June 2018 wedding at the Leslie family site in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are sick in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, indicating a change in trends in the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfused blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was virtually reduced to zero, and Chinese health representatives stated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Each year, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a pressing problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90 per cent of men having sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
In many cases, transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information about the leak of information on the fault of the Republican party senators, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conquest theory”
A U.S. Member of Parliament, Maxine Waters, denied the charge that one of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were forged by \"ultra-right\" experts and websites.
“The lie, the lie, and even more underly lies,” says Waters in his Twitter.
The published information is reported to include the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitoli hill during the Senate Commission hearing on sexual harassment charges against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three senators had questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gate Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source had been linked to the Waters office, and disclosed information about the Waters staff, Hill.
“This unsubstantiated assertion is absolutely false”, he assures Waters.
“My personnel whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions were in no way responsible for leaking that information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately called for criticism on the Internet, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer.
\"This is an angry denial,\" writes Fleischer.
“This means that the author has a temper not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why should you be angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself either.
And it's not worth digging for the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the interim elections, also made his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is very important,” he writes.
In her statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these frauds.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and to each of my employees.”
Johnny Ingleas strikes again — a weak parody on the spy Rowen Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that has in one way or another featured Britain; this applies to the new parody spy franchise \"Agent Johnny Inglay,\" which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film \"Agent Johnny Ingles: Reload\".
Would a self-imaging painting with a leithmotivate “evident that we are all shit” by a new attempt at national exports?
At any rate, Professor Johnny Inglizat’s puncture with a rubber face has been given his right to chaos for the second time — his name is most likely to suggest that he is a wide screen comic book designed for a non-English cinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, received some Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings, and a portion of this guy, who made one single note to the Chariots of Fire tune in London in 2012.
This character was originally created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious \"international\" Atkinson, once played in the now forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves complete chaos behind him.
This last issue of JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglez came near a helicopter wearing medium-sized armor, and the blades were lying on his helmet.
Yes, it shows the gift of Atkinson to the physical performance of the comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because the “serious” attempts, such as “agent 007” and “Mission of Incomplete”, are now safely offered to comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny Inglish's bizarre anger is not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's bewitches in Mr. Bina's films.
The constant premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker entered the supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the current agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, had an episodic role.
It's the last drop for the Prime Minister, the suspense and moody figure, who is already suffering from a huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can for the quasi-Teresi-May character, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to remove someone from the resignation.
And here is Johnny Inglez's very clumsy personal personage, who is now a school teacher at some pontiff institution, but also provides informal lessons on secret operational work: there are a few good jokes here, as Inglis offers the skills of the spy academy in the style of rock.
The inngoly returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his uninterested friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time.
Baf is now a married man, reporting to the submarine commander, the role of the “lucky hockey ticks” in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because there's been terrible mistakes in the secret service of Her Majesty, and they're facing a beautiful, year-round woman, Ophelia Bulletov, in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the charm of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve the British computer problems — the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waitress, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta; and Inglay creates complete anarchy by trying to use the guerilla of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All of these scenes, of course, are a sweet and expensive fiction, but there's something quite childish about it.
Quite moderate stuff.
And, as with other films by Johnny Inglish, I couldn't help but think, can't the British film industry give Rowen Atkinson a role really commensurate with his talent?
Leiberists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British workweek to four days for a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but pay will be paid in five days.
The Party reportedly wants company leaders to hand over savings resulting from the artificial intelligence revolution to employees by providing them with an additional output.
This would allow staff to enjoy three days ' leave for the same salary.
The sources indicated that the idea was “infiltrating” on the party's economic agenda and that it would help the country's people to take sides with the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the four-day work week to enable workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level Labour Party source said The Sunday Times: it is expected that policy revision will be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen at the same time, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to changing the economy’s balance sheet in favour of workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party was not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party had promised a four-day working week during its pre-election campaign of 2017.
However, this desire is currently not supported by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labourists conference to clarify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell said that he was determined to remove power from the “failed directors” and the “speculants” of utility firms.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water-channel shareholders may not get all their share back, since the Labour Government can make “accounts” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors and to create funds for the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to Pound500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell us \"60 Minutes\" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavano delayed a final vote on his appointment as Chief Justice for at least a week and asked whether any of the Agency ' s findings could encourage any Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelly, a 60-minute correspondent, interviewed Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their opinions.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"Well, of course,\" replied Kennedy.
\"When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and I came up with this information, and I said, \"Did you do that?\"
His response was decisive, determined and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion in the ballot remained firm.
“I am firmly determined about Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to dynamics,” he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know for sure one thing: Brett firmly denied all this,\" added Graham, turning to Christine Blacey Ford.
“No one who was summoned as witnesses was able to confirm these facts either.
This is 36 years old.
I didn't notice anything new in it.\"
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event in New York City, features an impressive star with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, at the Festival of Citizens of the World, tens of thousands of people flock to the Grand Lounge of Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of such actors as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Méndez, as well as to describe the purpose of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The festival of citizens of the world, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the global poverty reduction project carried out by an international group of human rights defenders that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free event ticket (if you're not willing to pay for the VIP bill), you had to participate in volunteering or e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people free to attend a concert truly convincing fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “cloquitism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters have been registered at the festival, with many different objectives.
It is recalled that these actions have promised world leaders more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that had been made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The team estimates that some 649 million people around the world have been directly assisted by funds.
One of the most significant commitments is the The Power of правосудия: a British partnership of investors and practitioners committed to helping children to reach their full potential, pledged $35 million to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national Governments and Global Cities, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of nutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Power Project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to a frequently asked question on the festival website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of the Global Citizen say, \"This will be a long and difficult path on which to stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Méndez, Cardie B, Jeanel Moné are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, with Deborah-Lie Fernes and Hugh Jackman being the lead.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister of the Interior
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinkke stated that Washington could “as necessary” use its Navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for studying new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as much as they do in Eastern Europe in southern Europe,” he says.
According to the official, there are certain ways and means to address the problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to open the seaways and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” says the Minister.
Zinke addressed the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stands as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is a more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” says the Minister, calling Russia “a single trick pan, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump Administration had set the goal of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “unusable” project of the North Stream II pipeline, which, according to Trump, Berlin made the “plenty” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it has been repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 project, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's bitter resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States had been a negative reaction from Germany, which had confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry in the German Federation (BDI) called on the United States to stay further from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our supply of energy, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following a recent meeting of German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator, Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, will examine carefully the possibility of running for President in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of running for the presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Holiooke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think of participating in the electoral race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and to start is our broken government, and for this, it takes a woman to go upstairs,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will give careful consideration to the possibility of running for President.”
Warren expressed her appreciation for the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting, “leading this district in a wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren is an open critic both of Trump himself and of his candidate for the office of Chief Justice Brett Kavano.
In her Twitter Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting”.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that Warren, the majority of voters themselves, did not think she should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
In contrast, thirty-two per cent of respondents supported its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible election and 48 per cent opposed it.
Other well-known names of democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Baiden claims that he will make a formal decision by January, reporting the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told me about Trac Paylin's posttraumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's voters.
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, served as an army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now in the same situation as the members of other families who have experienced the effects of PTSD and have been wounded and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talls, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest a “balm on the eye” and said of her son and other veterans of the war: “They are returned by others who are burned, wondering if the same respect for their fellow soldiers, soldiers, pilots and any other military personnel they have shown for their country”.
Trak Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the situation of violence and the possession of weapons in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of Vasilla Police Department.
18 states in Colombia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits the provision of safe havens for victims of flight or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district submitted on Friday in Washington, D.C., an analytical note by the court consultant on the support of the asylum-seeker challenging the policy.
The complainant's full name in the American Civil Liberties Alliance's lawsuit against federal policy in August is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons in the criminal gang” have ill-treated her, but that on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys, who support Grace, say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have submitted large numbers of asylum applications to the United States as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum from domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition is in violation of this principle”, states a judicial consultant's communication.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting the entry of immigrants are detrimental to the US economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “to provide the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashnes ordered immigration judges no longer to provide safe haven for victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Poverty will be provided to those who leave their country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief”, said Sashnes in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
The situation became more difficult for the survivors.
“It’s very difficult today,” says Risa Kusuma’s 35-year-old mother, who comforted her sick baby at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Each minute the ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water in a large deficit”.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Haris, who had fractured the spine and shoulder, were taken off by the army hospital of Palo, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave because of the continued strong force.
He weeps as he remembers how the severe earthquake destroyed the hotel number on the fifth floor that he took off with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think that I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're saved, and now they're all right.\"
The US Ambassador accuses China of “invasion” through “advertising advertising”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page edition of the daily American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade in the United States and China, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last night to the paid supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa State, and charged China with attempting to interfere with the election to the U.S. Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections was a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials had told the Reuters agency that there was a new stage in Washington's growing pressure campaign on China.
While it is normal for foreign Governments to post trade promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of escalation of the trade war, which makes them equal the tariffs on imports of their countries.
China ' s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which were supported by the Republic Trump Party, declared by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, argue that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writing to Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this herb by publishing an advertisement in our own free press”.
“In promoting its propaganda, the Chinese Government enjoys a dear tradition of freedom of speech and of the free press in the United States by paying and posting advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“One in the newspaper kiosks here on Beijing streets is unlikely to hear dissenting voices or to see the true diversity of opinions that Chinese people might be able to learn from China’s disturbing economic policies, since local media are under the strict control of China’s Communist party,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers was “frightly away” from the proposal to publish the article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Kavano is being dispersed by Republican women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand by and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Kavano despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions surrounding the situation had broken down to the extreme, and most Republicans had officially stated that they wished to proceed with the vote.
Such things cannot be returned, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in its most recent minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, and they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karen Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandalized \"November ahead!\" in front of the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate the Kavano cand, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the bounds,” stated news site nonpartisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg.
\"People say that the situation is already pretty bad, and that's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not pleased with the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for Supreme Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the motion, that step could trigger a reaction.
“It is already a riot for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee early last week, according to NBC News.
“There is not only a vote in the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavano has sat on the bench of the defendants, but also how the Republicans handle it, as they do”, says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in selecting Democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who should believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and a little more inclined toward the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believe exactly or likely Ford's statements, while 35 percent say that they either believe Cavanaugh or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh was likely or certainly lied in giving his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, testified to the Senate's Legal Committee that Kavano attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was intoxicated.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for Supreme Justice showed her his genitals at a party while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open-source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he sought that the purpose of Inrupt was to gain world domination.
\"We have to do it now,\" he says about his startup.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The annex uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own \"personal online data warehouses\" or PPDs.
It can contain contact lists, cases, calendars, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted for the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether or not his company should make radical changes that would make all their business models change at the same time.
“We do not ask permission from them.”
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid Network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate on neutrality on the network.
Even with Inrupt running, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Church servant awarded to the Cross of Victoria during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded a cross by Victoria during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglis and Løkour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had won a British military reward.
A memorial to this event was solemnly opened by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was \"very symbolic\" that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received his reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried out his battalion “in a very thick fog and under a strong fire of field instruments and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself onto the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led the group forward, then threw a field gun with one hand, and killed three soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that \"he couldn't have done the same heroically, but it's dying.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown at the end of the parade run by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that it is “a great privilege for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the credibility of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people”.
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppu's lead
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren't given a chance to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fighting, including six main programmes, and was broadcast live on 5 British television all night.
At 6 a.m., when Ghegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were horrified when they saw Pepp's Swine screen.
Some patients were not impressed, since they had not slept before morning just to watch the fights.
One Twitter fan described this change in broadcasting on a children's cartoon as “some kind of a sick joke”.
“It has been decided by the government that this content is inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to child programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communications, when asked why it happened.
\"Yes, 'Peppa Lead'
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they were planning to build a schedule in such a way that future battles could also be seen from Britain.
“What is the re-appraisal, I think, that we can resolve this issue,” says Coker.
\"But it's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we won't be able to resolve it until Sunday of our time, and for them it'll be Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the message was changed, there was a lot of text, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
Turns out no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fighting to five instead of six, as we normally do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we're going to have a fight.
Yes, it did not work well.\"
Dissert Island Discs: Tom Daley was experiencing a sense of inadequacy because of her sexual orientation
The Olympic daiver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than everyone because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that he was “not all like him” until he went to secondary school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Laurent Lavern, he said that he spoke about gay rights in order to give others “trust”.
He also said that he was less worried about winning the Olympics after he had a baby.
Kirsti Young has been on vacation for several months because of his illness.
Daley, who was the main guest in Loverne's program, said that he felt “more insignificant than any of the peers”, because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, for both boys and girls”.
He relates: “To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and incompetence were real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “one thing ” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learned of his sexual orientation.
The two-fold bronze Olympics have become a well-known LGBT activist and, in their performance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to be able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
A threefold champion of the world said that the feelings for the man, United States director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “kept him off guard”.
Last year, Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older, but claims that the difference was never a problem.
“If so many things happen in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a parent who has the same fundamentally opposite experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that his whole world had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about me winning the gold medal,” says the athlete.
“But you know there are things and more important than the gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.\"
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't want to accept what he was dying, and one of his last requests was to go to the front row for the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘ Dad, you won’t be there anymore, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’ says Daley.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” says the athlete.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive before a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Dessert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 English Summer Time.
Miquelson, who is not in uniform, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on a bench.
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to pull up his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played the binnal on the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürick to a bench on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the heart of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-fold major winner divided his day between watching a game and working on his own playing a field in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never had the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman was not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National rigid track, where a long reef would normally be punished for inaccurate blows.
And if the course is not enough frightening in itself, Mickelson will meet on Sunday at the exact British Open Cup Francesco Molinari, who joined up with a newcomer named Tommy Flintwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12th match make a fair start, the Miquelson match can be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, even though he could say more.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, shook my back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” commented Ferik.
\"He's pretty sure about himself.
He's walking the Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and so we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.\"
On Sunday, Miquelson will beat Nick Foldo's record by the number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Miquelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence had been of great benefit to the team.
“He's funny, sarcasm, he likes to give people up, and he's a great guy who's interested in it,” he explained.
\"I think this week young players were having fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is far more than just play.\"
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from his experience that strong leadership alone in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an adverse side.
Datchanin debuted in a 1997 match in Valderram, where a team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but had overcome the final line just slightly ahead with the least difference, winning 141 - 2 - 131 - 2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far,\" said Bjorn, who was in the picture, after watching Class 2018, winning the \"Le Golf National\" field from 5 to 3 both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in the 10-6 count.
So history will prove to me and to the team that this is not the end of it.
Tomorrow you'll be on full ground.
Go do the right thing.
Until the glasses are on the tablet, nothing's over.
We have a goal, a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I've told you that I'm not besieging at 12 of our team's players, but we already know that we're against the greatest players in the world.”
Sufficient to the way his players performed on their uncomfortable golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in this.
We're facing a different test tomorrow.
Individual statements begin tomorrow, and that's a different matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you stay there alone, you experience all of your powers as a professional golfer.
That is exactly what players need to think of, so that tomorrow will be a complete idea.
Now the partner is behind and he must make all his efforts too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that his players will act better individually than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Ferrick himself passed through this carnage of the last days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing Europe holding the \"Choudo in Medina.\"
“I remember every damn thing about it,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, put his players together before the last day.
\"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it as soon as possible, like in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts great pressure on the mid-point matches.
We've put our plan on the game in a proper manner, and we've set our minds up to do what we thought was right, you know?
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Macilroy in a top matche with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen a group of guys like this, and in that order, because I think they will overcome all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his own choice of individual players.
Operation of a new German warship re-delayed
The German fleet ' s newest frigate was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the older military boats of the cold war era, but this will not happen in at least the following year due to inadequate systems and long-term cost increases, local media reports.
The entry into service of Reinland-Platz, the main ship of entirely new Baden-Württemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the older Bremen class frigate.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, a host of anti-ship missiles, as well as some technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods, which should be able to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the constant deferral of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are becoming obsolete by the time they get into service, notes Die Zeit.
The evil frigate F125 got into news headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blahm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned the ship to the boatbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made a military ship useless when used in combat.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly critical as the Baden-Württemberg vessels would be operated by crews of about 120 seafarers — only half of the labour force on old Bremen class frigates.
It also turns out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its productivity and limits the ability of the IMF to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Platz was twice as heavy as a class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering Euro3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of holding the newest frigates on anchors are particularly important in light of recent warnings to reduce German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the naval forces had in fact “expected a reserve of ships capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem had been aggravated over time because the old ships had been removed from service, but they had not been provided with replacement vessels.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken into service by the fleet.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of flying mice
A new study in a Scottish Hill site aims to show how flying mice use the landscape to find food.
It was to be hoped that the data provided would give a fresh look at the behaviour of the unique winged mammals and help further conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common non-topyri, soprano netopyri, and brown long-sherfed bats and Dobanton nights inhabited by Invewe Gardens, Westerner Ross.
Special registries will be installed at some locations around the site to track the actions of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the screams as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, an adviser to NTS nature conservation, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important to flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as the formation of grasslands, as well as ways of maintaining forest masses that are optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout Great Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened with extinction because of the construction and work that affects their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may also pose a danger as a sticky tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and hunting of domestic cats.
Actually, flying mice aren't blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the population of bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who conduct regular interviews, exit checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The Organization has even established the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland in the site of Thrave in Damfreys and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats reside.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that the name is ideal territory for them.
\"Here in Thrave is a great place for bats to fly,\" he says.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good environment.
But much about the bats of the bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need in order to survive well.”
He recalls the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance within private ownership, since the unintentional destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young men and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Fly mice are protected by law, their destruction, digestive or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish flying mice conservation fund officer, calls on the public to help.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our flying mice, and we simply do not know how their many species live.”
Ronaldou denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Krishna Ronaldou denies the accusations against him of rape, calling them \"fail news,\" and claiming that people just \"want to poll,\" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published charges against the football player.
Forward Portugal and Juventusa were charged with rape by an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly occurred in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to tell her about the incident, reporting on Friday “Spiegel”.
In an Instagram video with 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronalda called it “failing news”.
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told today is all the fairy news, which is a five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
\"They just want to pollinate using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, to say my name, but that's only part of their job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm fine,\" adds a smiling athlete.
Ronald's lawyers are prepared to sue Spiegel for charges they have referred to as “unacceptable information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount consistent with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in Palms Hotel and Cassino in Las Vegas.
When he met at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an annal form, according to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her lap and told her that he was a “99 per cent good guy, but he was one-per-cent”.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear that she would be avenged” and feared “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence as she was still experiencing the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the \"Real Madrid\" from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian Yuwe giants in a transaction of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain is \"despites auto-producers lost forever\"
Mr. Greg Clarke, Minister for Business and Enterprise, said that Britain would “despite it forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its position as world leader in car manufacturing.
He also commented that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clarke says.
The Japanese automaker stated that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job loss.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it released nearly 150,000 vehicles, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, if there is no Brexit transaction, supply chains will be put at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “immediately” and the details for vehicles on purchase are provided by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain withdraws from the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be disruptions on the border, which the industry says may result in delays and a lack of spare parts.
The company says that Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its factory in Derbishire for longer than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May's plan in Chekers about future relations with the EU was “exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal, and we want to make a better agreement that will not only make progress at this time but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 “Today” on air.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains”.
Toyota was unable to clarify the time-frame for which production would be stopped but, in the longer term, warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years as the manager of the factory union, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be “transmitted for another week”, as the fight for Brett Kavano's candidacy is continuing, the White House stated on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, communication between Trump and Russia and potential impediments to justice by the President.
Whether Trump dismissed the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, in Washington, D.C., had caused a mass of speculation for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of an impeachment by the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the UN in New York.
Trump said that he would “not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI complaints against Kawano, further delaying the full vote in the Senate.
Tramp's secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been scheduled, perhaps this week, and may be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments before the Supreme Court.”
But we shall see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists have disputed this claim: Sanders did not conduct briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to the “disappointment” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing the public”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more meetings in response to journalists’ questions than any other President before him,” she added, without, however, exact figures: “We have these figures”.
Sanders believed that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is far better to talk to me”.
We try to do so as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've held over the past few weeks, and if you can speak directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.\"
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking persons.
The conference is only for the press, and it's rare at all.
Frivolous, and at times, President's strange behavior in front of assembled journalists this week in New York may be the answer why.
The Minister of Health has written to EU employees in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working in the Scottish GSS to express gratitude on behalf of the whole country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, wrote to staff less than six months before the withdrawal of Britain from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of making status applications for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit continued and this fall must be decided on.
However, the British Government has also increased its preparation for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is therefore right now that I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over and outside the EU are bringing valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombi underwent an emergency operation for head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee State Tigers' semi-protector, Christian Abercrombi, had undergone an emergency operation and suffered head injury on Saturday following the defeat of 31 - 27 in the Vanderbilt Commodores match.
The state chief coach, Tennessee Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
\"He went to the side line and just moved there,\" said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombi oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, told us that Abercrombi had an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “until there is no detail about the type/stage of the injury,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercrombi, who had only completed his second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State to move from Illinois.
Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, an amount of 18 balls per season.

Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fees for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless — today, Teresa May.
This step will nullify Corbin ' s efforts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more affordable and to increase citizens ' incomes.
Increased fees will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government's efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The allowance for the existing coat of arms, including the increase introduced two years ago for secondary accommodation and rental accommodation, can be up to three per cent.
Treasury expects up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London real estates are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and complicates the task for buyers acquiring their first dwellings to improve their housing conditions thereafter.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who, having purchased housing here, spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the herb collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of undermining real estate prices by acquiring land without actually using them, and urged Ms. May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to remedy the “disgusting housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent controls and an end to unwarranted evictions.
He also wants to give local government more power to build new houses.
Ms. May said, \" Last year I said that I had dedicated my presidency to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
That, among other things, also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-United Kingdom citizens as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for the labour-loving British.
For too many people, the dream of owning one’s home has become too far away, and the threat to some of them from the street is too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to run Scotland.
Boss of Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his \"end goal\" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
A 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the revival of the North-East Club, which is currently ranked third in the first league, separated from the first three points.
This summer he passed to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to Scottish Premier League last season.
\"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a cap B, and everybody,\" said Ross Sportsound BBC Scottland.
\"But I grew up watching with my father when I was a child in Hamden in Scotland, and it always attracted me back.
But this is only possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
Ross's predecessors, Sunderland managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moies, Sam Allardies, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paulo De Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says that he did not feel anxious about such authoritative names in such large clubs, previously abandoning the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
According to its structure and capabilities, this club no doubt belongs to the Premier League,” says the trainer.
\"To get him out of there is not an easy task, but I'll assume I've done my job only if I can get the club back.\"
Ross served as manager for only three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts Training Staff.
Then he helped Alloa rise from level three and led St Mirren out of his lower position in the champions next season.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“That must have been a real crossroads,” he recalls in his responsible work at Alloa.
“I truly believed that management would be more appropriate for me than playing.
That sounds strange because I've done good, earned a good job in this post, and I've made some progress.
But playing is more difficult.
There's a lot of stuff to do every week.
I still feel under stress at work, but I feel good at managing myself.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable with being a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to a full interview at Sportssound on Sunday, 30 September, on the Scotland radio from 12:00 to 13:00 p.m. in English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 was the ideal time for drinking beer.
Summer heat increased the sale of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant networks.
Statistics show a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in pubs and bars in July and 4.8 per cent fall in restaurants.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business company that received the statistics, says: “The long-term solar activity, as well as longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs rose by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, by contrast, significantly decreased”.
The fall in income from restaurant trade of 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results in comparable restaurants.
Food - only pubs were also affected by the sun’s heat, although not as hard as restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out of the street just to skip a glass.
The sale of beverages in pubs and bars rose by 6.6% per month and by 3% for food.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain critical factors in sales on the non-profit market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant networks continue to face difficulties, especially since a decline of 4.8 per cent in annual sales will be particularly painful due to the continuing price pressure.
The long hot summer has turned out to be more than ever for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will provide much needed rest.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the rollback of brands.
Monitoring the sector sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker on the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses the productivity data of 47 networks with a total turnover of more than Pound9 billion and is a recognized sectoral benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he's hiding from his parents.
According to the survey, 1 out of every 5 children — some only 11 years old — have secret accounts on social networks that he conceals from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the pages of the Fair Inst.
This news increased fear of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of the students said they had a \"core\" account that parents know about
However, 1 out of every 5 children — some only 11 years of age — make social accounts that he conceals from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of feic accounts of “inst”, i.e. Instagram, photo sharing sites.
This news increased fear of content publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a basic, “clean” account, which their parents had access to, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, accidentally granted access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who urged others to “sacrifice him”.
A study conducted by the UK Digital Security and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in social media, half of whom admitted that one was usually secret.
Chapter HMC Mike Buchanan says: “Many adolescents seek to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact.”
Eiled Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eiled Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish athletics as an observer of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled athletic athlete, and President Ian Beatty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the vast international experience of sportswoman over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to the athletics in Scotland,” Beatty argues.
Doyle says, \"I'm trying to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can make a really good contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.\"
An American who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games has four golden Olympic medals in total, and now works as a private commentator for BBC, after a shift of stroke has lost his ability to walk.

The milk report, in which mom-feeding was compared to cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The dairy company had raised disputes on the Internet, publishing advertisements in which nursing mothers were compared to domestic cows.
“The world’s first noiseless milk pump, which can be carried on the chest, ” Elvie, a consumer technology company, has published an advertising music video showing the freedom the new milk sucker gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in the full hayboard under a music track saying, \"Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail\" and \"If you don't notice, it's not washing, it's my breast.\"
The choir goes on to say, \"We track, we track, we feed our babies with breast milk, we track, we track.\"
This commercial, which was published on the Facebook page, has caused Internet disputes.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video has received mixed reactions from the audience, many saying that it sheds light on the “tribulations” of the dairy industry.
“A very poor decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth, ” writes one user.
Elvie is dressed directly under a special booklet (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It’s clear that it’s just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk sucker for mothers who leave their children behind?
Another user adds: “Reqlamo, cut off from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just wonderful. ”
\"I think that's a great idea.
If I had fed a baby, I would have bought one.
Breast feeding really made me feel like cow.
Advertising is, of course, a little crazy, but it's kind of felt like that.
A brilliant product, ” wrote one user.
And another comment: \"A fun ad for moms who breastfeed (often they do it directly in their workplace or in their toilets) and who, indeed, feel like a little bit of a cow,
It's not to praise or fight our dairy industry.\"
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they've all danced with these unmarked milk suckers hidden under brawlers.
The concept of this advertising campaign is simply based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie milk is completely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding cell, and is unobstructed, allowing women to move, hold small children, and even go out during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and child development expert at Mother, comments: “Molokootsos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By making a parallel between women and domestic cows, we wanted to focus attention on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing in a joking and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk pump gives.
It's not the first time Elvie milk sucks into news headlines.
During London's week of fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children freely moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively constant, partly because strict rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump have made the placement of children difficult.
Typically, most sponsors are the same undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by sponsoring a child.
Risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential lenders and other adult members of their families would have to print their fingers and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified in Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take responsibility for minors without custody.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been tried before.
“About 80 per cent of the people who are either co-sponsors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
We therefore continue to pursue these persons,” said Olbens.
With the words of the shelter officials, in an effort to speed up the process of child custody, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be brought to justice within a month of detention, not 60 days after the previous day.
In order to state its legal status as a judge of immigration cases, many of them are present by video link rather than in person.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter staff and information from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be disturbed or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs that the child is having difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that taking children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare for or say good - bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already fighting.
Syria orders the “occupying forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that war had been taking place in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions”, he said to the meeting.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and of“any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has over 1,000 troops in a war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “procurring irrational insurance” that had caused refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he says.
“They politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted to recover until a political agreement is reached between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province with three million inhabitants.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that hostilities would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related fighters of the Nusr Front, who would be “brought to ruin”.
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will soon be convened, comprising representatives of the Government and the opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government ' s participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “the consideration of the articles of the current Constitution” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump Wins a Second Time
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal prematurely ends his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers may hope for.
And it will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finality of the presidency in all history!”
So far, there is no sign of the fatigue of the audience.
Since 2014, fairtime ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC shows, The Rachel Maddow Show, surpassed cable channel ratings, collecting 3.5 million viewers at evenings while showing the main news.
“This is the fire that people are rushing towards, because it is beyond our grasp,” says Neil Bair, director of ABC’s “A Designated Survivor,” of a Cabinet member who becomes President after the Capitol has been destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-standing comedy writer and author of “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about how to get into the Hollywood Boys Club, ” offers a different theory.
She recalls one day driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
\"Why?\" she asked.
He said, \"Because he's funny,\" she said.
In all of this chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content on television, Washington’s case lines can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of family reunification of immigrants and the health of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, when you watch for six consecutive hours, an expert group discussing Bob Woodward's use of a “deep background” for his book Fear, or Paul Manafort’s 15,000 - dollar jacket of ostrich skin (an item of pride, as the Washington Post says, or a sharp description of Stormie Daniels, let's say Mr. Trump’s anatomy, is already beyond mere knowledge.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes, for example.
“Partly his job is to make us feel like a reality show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of Pawn Stars about the changing acting composition of Trump’s show and the daily turns of the story.
You can't afford to miss any episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the North Bank of Kauai, a bright sun, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break off the screen, at least not when he showed how Brett Kavano would appear before the Senate Legal Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘ This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'” says Mr. Flace.
\"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.\"

Outsider money is poured into the worst White House intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives cash flows as a result of the change in the districts in Congress, where two officials participate in the race for the same seat.
This suburban district of Pittsburg, whose geography has not been changed for so long, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Kit Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which substantially overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old areas, in violation of the Constitution, had been attributed to the Republicans as a result of electoral frauds.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a heated debate on the financing of the main party's financial forces, the Committee of Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamb came to be known in Pennsylvania after a victory with a small difference in the March special congressional elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The US ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had triggered Washington's negative reaction.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama, who was also owned by him in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the grounds of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, stating earlier this month the Spokesman of the department, Heather Nauert.
However, only El Salvador was subject to punishment, which received about $140 million in assistance to the United States in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country of Central America, with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was being followed to take stock of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior management representatives had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, and in fact had stopped considering the issue of the punishment of El Salvador.
The conference was scheduled for mid-October, according to diplomats, and would be attended by Vice-President Mike Pence, indicating that the Administration attached real importance to the meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, not taking any new strong messages or sanctions with them from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirmed an outside analyst who was part of the administration but also referred to an anonymous environment.

The next step could be to inform Special Adviser Robert Muller of the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which is now very substantial in public reports.
Mr. Müller is also reportedly coming to investigate the collusion of Trump's campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress were to replace its host, Mr. Trump would be in the face of responsibility in that body, just as he was preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of if; I don't want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d ' état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak forces in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and this made it impossible for us to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
This is where the course of history unfolds, and the relentless march of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who was in control of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this paper, last year, he proposed to make secret records of the President's activities and reasoned on his unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein states that the data from The Times are incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavano is not complete or genuine, or if he is eventually confirmed as a supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we, in the medium term, vote in favour of the Congress which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can go through them worthily thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jewish, sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an ambassadorial house in which I lived many years later.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she led me to light Saturday candles on the table with a symbol of swastika.
With such a family background as I may not be optimistic about our future?”
Norman Eisen, Senior Research Fellow of the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of Civil Affairs for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of Last Palace: Europe’s Anxiety Age in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary Home.
Graham Dorrans, of Rangers, was optimistic about a clash with the Vienna Rapid football club.
Rangers are taking the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after being impressed by anyone in Spain over Willarreal at the beginning of this month, will enable them to take strong positions in Group G of the League of Europe.
The injury of the knee prevented Graham Dorrans' semi-protector from speaking for the first time in the season to nobody at 2:2 v. Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a trample to achieve greater results.
\"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,\" said a 31-year-old football player.
\"We entered the game, believing we could get something, and we left no one.
Perhaps, after all, we could succeed, but in general, nobody was likely to be a fair result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success was at the second time, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another major European night on this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they've shown a good score in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
The past year has definitely turned out to be a tough one, given all that's involved with my injuries and my club replacements, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is well chosen, and the boys really enjoy it; the training went to the ‘ura'.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pension savings
Despite the fact that the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people participating in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10 per cent said they were talking to their children about the matter.
\"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't try to talk to them about it,\" says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationguide for Life Insurance.
You have to start with that.
Speak to your spouse and children, and you cannot prepare your family for what they will likely have to take care of you unless you make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice may be an important factor in cost.
Consult your financial consultant to help you develop a plan to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by the traditional long-term care insurance policy or the mixed lifetime cash insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your own property, provided you have the money.
Order your legal instruments: free yourself from legal strikes.
Set your confidence in health care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that the professionals fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that consideration should be given to the creation of financial confidence.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and keep track of your accounts if you are not able to do so.
And do not forget the little things: imagine that your aged parent needed emergency medical attention, and he is on his way to hospital.
Would you then be able to provide information on what medications he is taking and on what allergies he has?
Write down all these pieces on paper, just to make sure it's ready.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have finances, but also to have doctors choose”.
\"What drugs do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Write down and write down the plan.”

A man shot a pneumatic rifle several times, returning home from the party.
The victim, in his chest, whose stomach and arm were hit by bullets for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 in English summer time as “sudden”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, so far the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said that at least 384 people were killed as a result of the great earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and that the number of deaths was expected to rise.
Out of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Pala that is closer to the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
In Pala, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palo and Donggal, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district extending along the 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The district, the administrative district, was smaller than the province, with 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the Central Sulawesi province economy, in particular the Donggal coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important for the province ' s economy, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunamis have destroyed Palo and Donggal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Burning Ring and suffers from earthquakes on a regular basis.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The sequence of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake struck south Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, with a tsunami hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in Padang, capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentava Islands in Sumatra, killing some 300 people, with a tsunami of up to 10 metres.
2016: A weak earthquake hit Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the 2004 devastating earthquake and the tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily killed.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice candidate for President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Paylin, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the situation of domestic violence and for resisting the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone away.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the Mat-Su Detention Facility and will be released on bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “one-sided innocence”.
Paylina is threatened with three minor offences of Class A, which means he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence punishable by imprisonment of up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This was not the first time that criminal charges had been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police, reporting an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and the possession of weapons in a state of alcohol in response to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sara Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behaviour as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications do not work, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital, Jakarta.
There are video recordings of the incident on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to carry out a rare death sentence in New York to a suspect in a terrorist attack.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, a suspect of a New York terrorist attack, which resulted in eight deaths, a rare penalty for a federal crime that had not been committed in the State since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sayipov killed eight people “intentionally” and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notification of his intention to achieve the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court record, these two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read Saipov ' s conviction with 22 prosecutions, which included eight charges of killing a recette, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as the charge of using violence and destroying cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “immediately planned and deliberate”, and Saipov carried it out, as it is described, “in a cruel and criminal manner”.
“Saifullo Habibullaević Saipov suffered injuries, injuries and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lor Dekdat, Darren Dreik, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagneukko”, states the notification of intent.
Five of them were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor ordered the death penalty in the Southern District of New York for criminal offences.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time, the federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for collusion in favour of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the cold war.
Rosenbergs were executed using an electric cable on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's judicial documents, Uzbekistan's citizen showed that there was no repentance after the attack he had committed.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the IGIL video on the phone.
He also asked for the IGIL flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Sayipov, said that they were “expressed” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without release will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all of them,” said Patton.
Saipov's defence had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The member of Parliament of Tori said that NYJEL FRAG should not be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Faraz vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
The former leader of the UKP said that politicians should “feel the rush” of the Euroskeptics, since a member of the Parliament of Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a member of the conservative party, said at the Birmingham meeting that Great Britain would have been “above” if Mr. Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, is compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori Party who oppose withdrawal from the EU join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to preserve his compromise plan, announced at Chekers in the midst of an attack by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite negative reactions, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between her package and her haos.
Mr. Bowen said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihal that he wanted to \"play Chakers\".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should level and hold him responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have gone out, ” he said.
Deputate Wellingborough added, \"I will continue to advocate Brexit, but we need to play Chackers.\"
Speaking against the EU, he said, \"We didn't fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is totally wrong”.
Andrea Jenkins, a advocate of the Tori Party, was also at the meeting, giving journalists this comment: \"I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.\"
“Checkers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for the plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and choose us first.
Please put it back to Chakers and start listening to what you are being told.\"
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain at their jobs if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if politicians were going to submit a decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to “feel a rush”.
“It is now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, \"We're not going to get it off your hands.\"
Turning to the horrified crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of being betrayed by Brexit, to feel a rush.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has won us Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents had a demonstration on Birmingham, then a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists were swinging \"Tori v. Brexit\" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, criticized conservatives because of security problems in the mobile app of their party.
“These people claim that they can tune Canada’s IT systems and technologies plus plus, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland”, he added.
\"It's one complete farce.
Good Brexit doesn't exist in principle,\" he argues.
Warren plans to “expect” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Member of Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “expect the possibility of running the President”.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday described her future at a town meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, protested in November for re-election against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has a chance to take up Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holioco, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since Trump took office, it was her 36th meeting with the voters in the format of the town hall meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to start is our broken government, and for this to happen, we need a woman upstairs”.
As a result of the murder of Sims (stranded), a LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect suspected of killing a basketball player, LSU Wade Sims, on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11 a.m. to English, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department published a video recording of a shooting to help identify the person who was able to be filmed.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims received a wound in his head that caused him to die,” stated the chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to participating in the incident, carrying weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
At the time of his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A young man, 1 m 82 cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 games last season, and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 game picks.
Grand In Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Walter Bottas was trained on Saturday by Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes Command Tactics would play a major role in the race.
With the Polish post office, Bottas started off well and practically hanged on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fette was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton browsed in the tail of the whole group, a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes left one round after another, and then left Fettel behind, but Hamilton, after some struggle to wheel in the wheel, broke forward, causing the Fairarium driver to hesitate to leave his inside space free, risking getting caught up after a double-walk to defend himself on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of a series of nets and was in the seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, while holding his own tires, to be quickly financiated, driving Kimi Reikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually went to pit-stop on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the pace on the remaining eight circles, because Reikkonen took the fourth place.
The day seemed difficult, since Walter had done a fantastic job on the weekend and had shown true nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a couple of tricks on the reserve, so he said to Hamilton.
Precautionary Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Finestein at a meeting with the electors on Saturday for not disclosing Christine Blacey Ford's letter accusing Bretta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the high judge's office, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the Senate had shown that the participants in those events were “stupid, indecisive and false people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it is anger, anger, disgustingness and lies,” he said.
\"You see all these leaks, and then they say, \"No, I didn't.
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Did you \"screw\" the information?
Remember her answer... did you \"scroll\" the information of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't shed tears.
Okay, stop.
No, we didn't \"slide,\" he added with the senator's intonation.
In July, Finestain sent a letter detailing Ford's charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feynstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I did not conceal Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not leak her information,” said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she requested.\"
However, the manner in which she denied the charge of diversion did not seem to like the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “That's what I'll tell you: the language of the body has given her a great deal.
Maybe she didn't \"sweep\" but the body language was the worst I've ever seen.\"
The President, while continuing to defend his candidate for the office of Supreme Justice, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, suggested that the Democrats use these accusations for their own ends.
“They certainly try to regain power by all means available to them.
We have seen drowsiness, indecency, they don't care who they're going to hurt, through whom they've got to move to get power and control,\" quotes the mediate from the President's words.
British Hockey League: \"Dandy Stars\" 5-3 \"Belfast Jayants\"
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Jayants in a game against Dundee
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, Dundee Stars paid for Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants by winning a 5-3 Saturday match in favour of Dundee.
Jayants won an early two-headed advantage thanks to the blows of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowiller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the house team before Duyer took Jayants out to lead.
François Bouchar compared the Dundee account before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goal held them back.
For Adam Kif's men who won the Dundee on Friday night 2:1 in Belfast, this was the third defeat during the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties during the season when Jayants won three previous matches.
Duyer's first goal was at 3:35 a.m. after the bare pass of Kendall McFall with the support of David Rutherford, after which Boviller doubled four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney to equalize the score of 15:16.
Douier verified that Jayants had taken the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal at the end of the first period.
The masters regrouped, and Bushar re-equipped the bill, scored the goal at a numerous weight of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nilsen give Dundee the first chance for a match to win at the end of the second period, after which he and his team established a victory by holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
Jayants, currently losing four of the last five games, is heading to Milton Keynes for the next match to be held on Friday.
Air traffic control was killed so that hundreds of people aboard the plane could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic inspector was fatally assigned to the hero's title after he deliberately went to death to allow the plane to take off safely with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many lost their lives as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, the tsunami.
The area continues to be destroyed by strong underground formations, and many residents of the city of Palu have been destroyed by building debris.
Although his colleagues were saved by fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrifying control tower of Mutiar Sis Al-Jufrey Airport, the city of Palo.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in the airstrip, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was going down, he jumped off her.
Later he died at the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation representative Johannes Sirait said that the decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter went to Pala.
“We deeply regret this loss,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that thousands of people may be killed as a result of the earthquake, as access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited according to the disaster management agency.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under debris and many have not been able to get out,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu was devastated by the six - foot [6 m] high and would undergo a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says to Sky News: “A quick help brings the victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.\"
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, relates to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know they're going to stay there.
Tragedy has already taken quite a serious dimension, but it can be much worse.\"
Indonesia's President Joko Vidodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and addressed the armed forces in the country, saying in particular: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?\", says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered from the Lomboca earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that one person was missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight, which suffered a collapse in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, whereas it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
The Air Niugini report says that as of Saturday, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find the person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
The local sailors helped save the other passengers and the aircraft’s crew after he fell on the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday six passengers had been hospitalized and all were in stable condition.
The causes of the air crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane started to hit the airstrip too low.
\"And that's very good,\" says Janes.
Janes told him that he and other passengers had managed to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane, as the water level was belted.
He also explained that the stewardess had panicked and screamed on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy reports that seafarers who repaired the docks had also helped in rescue by using an inflatable boat that carried people to shore before the aircraft plunged about 30 metres (100 feet) under water.
Flight Safety Network data show that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in air accidents with PNG-registered aircraft, but none of these accidents have been related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has proved the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of the death of a Mississippi resident in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rooulett gave long-term testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to provide an overall picture of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information he received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when that happened, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that \"this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville.\"
Another difference was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they only rang within one week.
Roulette also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” says Hale.
The defence must begin with the statement of its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hoppers are going to combat negative attitudes towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop content has changed, moving away from initial political and social problems.
The group wants to return to its roots and make the “conscious” hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and Common have recently witnessed a revival in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
The New York nanny sued a family couple because of racist text
The New York nanny filed a lawsuit against a family couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “one more black”, which the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that an action has been brought with “the purpose of extortion”.
Linsie Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the Child Care Service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEIESEET, not one, one chernay,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending text to her husband, she sent it twice erroneously to Miss Maurice.
In light of her obsolescence, the “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the African-American-born babysitter was not doing his job well and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, report to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice sus a couple and seeks compensation for dismissal of $350 a day in six months, under conditions of initial oral agreement, which, however, have not been secured by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable,” she said, “Post” on Friday, adding,“And I know they are discrimination.”
Spouses disagree with the charge of racism and claim that Maurice’s dismissal could be considered a reasonable step, since if she had been wronged, they would no longer have been able to trust her.
\"My wife sent her in a message something she didn't really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” said the husband, Joe Plasco, in the Post.
\"But would you trust your children with someone you were rude with, even if you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!'\"
He said that his wife gave birth to a child only two months ago and found herself in a “very difficult situation”.
\"And are you willing to persecute a man in this situation?
It's not very nice on your part,\" added a bank worker specializing in investment.
The trial is still under way, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable conduct and of having problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not catch a move with a speaking bear, says a new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the publication of the book, said of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it is published.
It is very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also told me that her father, before he decided to write a children's book on the bear, worked as an operator for BBC, would refuse to publish with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his books was “and happy and bitter” because the author had not become their author last year.
As for Paddington's bear itself, she refers to him as “the most important member of our family”, and her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became aware.
“He was a quiet and modest man,” says his daughter.
\"Bride Paddington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really regard it as his own merit.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nizza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“On a regular basis, Nad called and said that everything was really wrong, that something went wrong, ” relates Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
“But he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said: “I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died before expected.
I was supposed to just sit and wait, knowing everyone's coming to the end.
I couldn't cry or shout or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to keep myself in my hands.\"
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, humbled herself to the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“No one else knew what had happened,” she says.
“My head ran away, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this egregious feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are placed on the Wells Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can request support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed and died at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same things I experience every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, tells us that her son was a great cook and had a damn, charming smile.
\"Everybody loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the room was like the light was lit.
But before he died, he left his job, because he had experienced a truly terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler ended up with his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs Davis says, \"I don't stop afraid I'm going to have a chain reaction.\"
Mrs. Davis came up with these postcards, \"so people know there's someone you can address and tell, even if it's a friend of yours.
You can't sit and keep quiet, you have to talk to people.\"
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who lived with him for 15 years, not soon after his mother died.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, upset, or that sort of thing, ” she says.
\"We noticed the change in his mood a couple days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day, he didn't even look at the children when they opened their gifts.\"
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to pass through it, and it was a shock to our family.
It broke her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Bretta Cavanaugh hangs in his hair: the FBI is starting an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — a time- and volume-bound investigation, we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was breaking up against the growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
Interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, all of them go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavano, who has worked for the White House in Mr. Bush since then, and who, thanks to Bush, has met his future wife, Ashley, who was working for Mr. Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which now consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kawano would be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the office of Chief Justice.
North Korean outflows decreased at Kim
Since Kim Jong-yong came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined, saying South Korean legislator.
Pak Bön Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared with 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, the figure declined to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China had been key factors, as well as higher rates imposed by human smugglers.
Pyongyang doesn't make public comments.
South Korea's nationality is ultimately being offered to the overwhelming majority of North Korean fighters.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run across China with the longest border from North Korea, which is easier to cross than a securely demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the fugitives as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often exposes them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Yon in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the matter.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally”, said Mr. Ri in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano \"historic\" and claims that he is not suitable for work before the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives called Bretta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the office of Supreme Justice, “historical” and said that he, because of his temperament, was not suitable for work before the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment at a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot help but think that if a woman had ever behaved in this way, she would have been immediately called hysterical,” Pelosi says about her reaction to the statements of Cavanaugh before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's accusations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Kawano acted emotionally enough, even scolding and inhaling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democratics of the Committee, calling the charges against him “gratistically and clearly planned to kill the person in question”, organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that in her view, by her testimony Kawano merely confirmed that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she was biased towards the Democrats.
“I think that he is disqualified by his allegations and by the way he attacks Clinton and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when she was asked if she would try to hold Cavanaugh accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is present,” said Pelosi.
Kavano is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano on the Accessive Health Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At his candidacy, Kavano sided with the question of whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“Now is not the time to put a hysterical and biased man into the office of high judge, and to cry out: ‘ How wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, and it can't go through it without tears.
\"When we get angry, we cry,\" said Miss Steinem 45 later.
\"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?\"
She continued: \"I was very helpful to a woman who was in positions of leadership, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she explained to her interviewee: 'You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm actually pissed off.
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are mistreated.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office, where men dominated me: one day I cried out of angry anger, but I was caught for the sequel by an elderly woman, an airless manager, whom I had always feared horribly, and pulled onto the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said to me.
\"They do not know that you are weeping for evil.
They think you're upset, and they rejoice at what finally proved you.\"
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor intrigue and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
“The decision was not thought of, ” she admitted to me 30 years later.
“seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and the last one they needed is another candidate.
Someone called the case of \"Wireless and seven Dwarves\".
The campaign had already come to an end, it had been very behind in raising funds, and she had vowed that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It seemed like a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men offered her only $250.
“I am a valued commodity, am I?” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not engage in a formal campaign, she was so embroiled with emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, the disappointment of a system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as anger over gender discrimination that she was inhaling.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Ms. Schroeder on how the press responded to her.
\"I might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, well, what would they write on my monument?
“She was so sobbing without the end”
How a Trade War With America Can Be Useful for Beijing
The experts believe that the first U.S.-China trade war bursts have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, the rift between countries can have long-term benefits for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made a first warning early this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs impacted products worth $200 billion (150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has struck counter-attacks every time, recently imposing $60 billion in duties on American goods between 5 and 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response to the US will be equal every time, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to begin at least the smallest in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to give up, but publicly to give up the US would be too shameful for Si Jinpin, President of China.
However, experts are of the view that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure from the U.S. trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic pressures in any of these countries is, in fact, more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” says Abigail Grace, an academic member of the New American Security Analytic Center (Center for New American Security), specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was ready to return refugees
Syria declares that it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and is seeking assistance in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that conditions were improving in the country.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore terrorist-affected areas so that people can live there in peace.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that had affected their daily lives are now in place.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country needed humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for its assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe consolidates the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning a total of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US$ 6 consecutive times have been lost on European land and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown thanks to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points he needed to win over the United States.
The American star, Phil Miquelson, who fought most of the tour, took his first long shot at the 16th row of couples-3, and entered his match of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1x-4th players who were ever 5-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
An American named Jordan Speth suffered the defeat of 5:4 players with the lowest rating on the European team, Turbjor Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave in 2:1 to Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spanishman Sergio García, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, was the winner of a tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points for a career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all on the team, and I'm glad I could help,\" says emotional García after a European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Rema, who won the American legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 alone.
“I am incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23-year-old Rem.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange to one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 leading titles, only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekends to make an effort to succeed, and the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest-class golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürick said after his team's dismay: \"I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
This morning, we managed to jump Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were playing superbly.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Ryder Cup, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We should be able to lose.
We have lost.\"
Red tide: micro-organisms have declined in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report reflected a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, there are reports of widespread flowering, which indicate a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red tide extends approximately 130 miles from northern Pinell to southern Lee districts.
Areas can be seen about 10 miles away from Hillsborough, but the number has declined significantly since last week.
The red tide is also found in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near the Pinellas district, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough coastal area, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte district, high concentrations on the Lee district coast, and low concentrations in Collier district.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Collier districts, there is still a likelihood of irritability of the respiratory tracts.
In northwestern Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
