Welsh extra MPs are concerned about what they look like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to \"member of Parliament of Wales\" status.
The MPs resented because of plans to change the name of the local assembly to that of \"The Parliament of Wales\".
The MPs of all political views suggest that this is some sort of deal.
One MP-Liberist said that his colleagues were concerned that this was rhymed with the words \"stupid\" and \"sunny\".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means \"stupid\", and pwp means \"undoreka\".
The MP said that her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
Welsh conservatives said that their group was ready to discuss a change in the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a short word transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to a \"majority\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as much as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now developing a draft law to make changes to the name, made the statement, \"The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the assembly call would, of course, be an issue of the members themselves.\"
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national proposal consultation, in which extensive support was expressed to call the meeting the Wales Parliament.
As for the title of additional deputies, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales or the CPU, but the CUP option received the most support during public consultations.
Additional MPs obviously offer alternative alternatives, but the way to reach consensus can become a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is supposed to submit a bill of change over several weeks.
The reform ordinance will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, such as rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they do their drafting.
Macedonians vote at a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters vote to change their country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" or against that.
The national vote was organized in order to resolve the perennial issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, it was long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour represented a claim to their territory, which prevented Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and North Atlantic Alliance.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, associate referendum on change of name, stated that he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that change of name is simply the cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The called St Martin's Temple is silenced, the bouncles in Harlem fight for the existence of
\"Early, as the old men I spoke to spoke to said, there was a bar and a church at every corner,\" said Mr. Adams.
\"Today is neither one nor the other.\"
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
\"People have different relationships and deals at present,\" he said.
\"Bars are no longer cozy local hotels where people walk constantly.\"
As for the churches, he worries that money from selling assets does not catch up for as long a period as leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
The churches, - added he, - could be replaced by living houses with condominiums filled with people who would not help the temples that would remain in the area.
\"The vast majority of the dwellings that buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,\" he said, \"and so it will speed up the day when these churches will close together because it is unlikely that the excesses of people moving to these condominiums will become the arrivals of these churches.\"
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black district . . . The Church of Steel Society in 1870, the Church of St. Martin . . . a decade later .
The original white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community praying nearby was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by a black public led by the likes of John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or advance blacks.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but Father Johnson-led believers planned the reconstruction: they introduced the brownie into operation.
Like David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carrion \"calls of poor people\".
The expert who played the brownie in July called it otherwise, \"Cultural Treasure\" and \"Unreplaceable Historical Instrument\".
Expert Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also pointed out that this was the world's first brownie to be played by Black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger brownie in the Riverside Church .
Mr. Merriveser said that in St. Martin's Church, he had not been replaced.
What happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story between architects and subcontractors, some of whom have been attracted by the false leaders of the church, and others by the diocese.
The Assembly of the Believers - the governing body of the coming, which consists of the assistants of the chaplain, - wrote in the diocese in July with a caution that the diocese would \"try to translate the costs\" to the assembly of the believers, although the assembly did not participate in the hiring of architects and sub-contractors that the diocese had sent to the diocese.
Some arrivals complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the epiarchy.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy during the daiving to catch lobbysters in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting Lobstars in California on the opening day of the season, catching the browsters.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach beach in Ensignitas.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was doing daiving with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy yelling, asking for help, and then sailing with the rest to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just an excitement from catching the browsters, oli then he \"knowed that something bad had happened, \"I've been bitten!
I'm bitten!\"
\"All his key was torn,\" said Hamel , adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I called out to everyone to come out of the water, \"In the water near the shark!\" added Hemel .
The boy was transported by air to Reidi's baby hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that have made the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Jayles, stated at the media briefing that the shark had been seen in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Jayles added that the victim had been injured by the upper body injury.
Officials closed the approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for the sake of safety.
Jayles has noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plan to advance into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in the department where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant advance in the British beauty market with a turnover of Â£2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the volume of sale of fashionable clothes and household goods is reduced, larger houses of beauty will be represented in 11 saloons across the country and also in other new saloons the following year, demonstrating success.
Investments in the realm of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on the shelves that were previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and goods for the home.
Sainsbury's said to double the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw that will appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the firm departments like those that can be found in shops like Boots.
Large shops also restart their Boutique cosmetics ruler, so that most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trade is becoming increasingly demanding among young buyers.
In addition, Fragranance Shop's perfumery store will test concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in southern London, and the second will open in Selli Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day at local shops near home makes the supermarket have to make more effort to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that the shopping points would be more and more like a department store, because a network of supermarkets was trying to compete with Aldi's disclaimers, Liddle using more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's placed Argos shopping points in hundreds of shops, as well as placing several Habitats dots since two years ago acquired both networks, which he said contributed to the growth of food sales and made the purchase more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and pharmacy departments did not succeed.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to share revenues from apologetic shops ended after a series of proceedings at supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio store owner Lloyds Pharmacy for Â£125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played his role in this regard by expanding the assortment of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, \"We changed the appearance of our beauty saloons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our assortment of brands is designed with any need in mind, and attractive obsolescence and comfortable accommodation make us the best house of beauty that resists the old way of shopping.\"
Peter Jones dislodged after Holly Willabi refused the deal for Â£11 million.
Dragons Star Den Peter Jones disintegrated after the TV-run Holly Willabi refused a deal of Â£11 million with his brand specializing in the image of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There is no time for a brand of goods for the house and the Truly accessories in Wilubi.
The couple's business became similar to the Guinean Peltrov Goop brand.
This morning a 37-year-old lead announced to Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willabi has left Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, who is now parting with his lucrative business of creating brand clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was dilapidated when the \"golden\" girl of television admitted during a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals of up to Â£1.5 million mean that she would no longer have enough time to do domestic goods and brand thruly accessories.
The business was similar to the Guinean Peltrov Goop brand and was increased by two to double the welfare of Willowby by Â£11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced to Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the United Kingdom and headed for one of his vacation houses.
Source reported: Truly was Holly's top priority.
This emerged as her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday very soon had to start dinner.
There is a warehouse at Marlow headquarters full of goods ready to sell.
Experts suggest that the care of leading This Morning, which enters the number of the most significant British stars, may cost companies millions due to huge investments in various goods--from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and due to possible further delays with their exercise.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of the three Willube and Dan Baldwin's husband were close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willabi founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40 percent part in a television firm named Baldwin.
Willubi will become a M&S brand representative and replace Aunt McPartlin as leading ITV \"I am a celebrities.\"
Last night's source, close to Jones, reported, \"We will not comment on his affairs.\"
Honesty A conversation \"after which we fell in love\"
He fires about the criticism he receives from the mass media for his comments, which he considers \"unpresidiar\" for speaking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump give up much of what?
Trump said his adviceal \"dictorial\" voice.
\"I don't give up on anything.\"
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was declared Trump as a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denucleorization have come to a dead end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, stated to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not been expected to \"match the west\" of the United States in response to North Korea's previous steps in the disarmament field.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
\"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea,\" he said.
\"All could end the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have good attitudes.\"
He said that his efforts to improve attitudes with Kim had brought positive results: completion of rocket tests, aid in freeing hostages, and the return of American troops' remains home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
\"To be on the side of the President is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people there,\" Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on v. Lambock, foreign NGOs were told they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that over 10 percent of the population of Lambock were displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a necessary condition for international assistance to be provided.
\"Alas, in many cases, it was realized that they were not addressing international aid, so it was a little difficult,\" said Mrs. Sumbung.
Though the Save the Children Foundation (Save the Children) and gathers a team to travel to Paul until it is understood whether foreign employees can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the national agency for dealing with tedious disasters, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to find out whether or not international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite earthquakes that always undergo Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the hazards of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh, there are hardly any in other shore towns.
The apparent lack of siren for tsunami warning in Paul led to more casualties, although warning and was.
Even in the best times, moving between many islands in Indonesia has been a difficult task.
And stifling disasters have made shifting logistics difficult.
A hospital vessel that has been placed on c. Lambock to treat earthquake victims is approaching Pale, but the way to a new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joco Wido focused his pre-eminent campaign on improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure and spending money on roads and railroads.
But lack of funding is being pursued by Jok's administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka also faces the pressure of continued inter-religious tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives accept more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machete, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.

The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, reported on Sunday morning by the Agency for the Elimination of the Consequences of Stunning Disasters.
At a press conference, a representative of the Sutop Purvo Nugroho agency stated that according to reports, many people found themselves trapped in ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-point earthquake, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, in which more than 380,000 people live, was capped with debris of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after having killed a woman.
An investigation into the murder was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Mersaid) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with knife wounds in the Grayson-Muze district in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for them to be contacted by people from this area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, \"The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on everyone, in particular taxisters whose video registers may have taken some video off, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.\"
A police representative confirmed that a woman whose body had been found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today's afternoon's friends of women came to the scene to ask themselves: where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue, and police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxister living in Grayson Muze has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He lost his language when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The police officer explained to one person that the entire district is now the scene of the crime.

Cromwell's Parliamentary statue became the last vecapom strike in the case of \"rewriting history\".
Its removal would be poetic justice for its similar to the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, committed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
\"But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as \"stupidness\" and \"try to rewrite a story.\"
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, In the course of the current debate over the demolishing of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclastic of English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Tornicroft's vivid representation of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of the act that many believe must be honored so far.
Mr. Goldsmith stated the Sunday Telegraph, \"Kromwell's many know from the end of the 19th century better than today as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of lengthy historical debates.
It is no doubt that the mid-17th century conflict formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure representing one side of that encounter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to note and honour them.\"
The pig-killer had killed a Chinese farmer.
As local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwest China.
\"The man whom they know only by nicknames - Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and an inflated blood, next to a shed on the Lupanshui market in the province of Guichjow,\" reported the South China Post on Sunday.
The swineman was preparing to introduce a pig vaccine in a swine on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in Qinhai province of China.
He and his cousin reportedly arrived on Wednesday from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the next swine was open.
He said there was a great knuckle with blood on the sand in the swine.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that 550-kilogram knier had dehydrated the farmer.
\"My cousin's feet were covered and damaged,\" said the cousin from Wu's surname (as cited by Guiyang Evening News).
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan had entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
An animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuana or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent an attack on someone else, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene of the event.
According to reports, the yuan family and the market administration negotiate compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, they were still before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts State, resulting in serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier the pig's weight of 650 pounds pressed the Welsh farmer to his tractor and held so until his wife had let go of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon State was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act like a descending hook.
\"They are just playful.
They are biting and very inquisitive...they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,\" he said.
The remainder of Hurricane Rose will bring strong spilling rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rose is weak because it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring in floods in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
The velocity of Rose, Hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles/hour at 5 p.m. according to Eastern time on Sunday, and it was fixed at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area moving eastwards begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, to the western coast of the United States.When Rose gets close to the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up up to 10 inches of rainfall in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the coming area of low pressure, in the coming days exposing strong torrents in the southwest.
In places ranging from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation, the dangerous sudden floods, selenium flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall in places as high as 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of Arizona, two to four inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the disgrouped areas of tropical rain, it is possible for a sudden flood to occur when conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be highly undesirable to go out into the wilderness on foot due to the possibility of the threat of tropical rainfall.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by a parched wind and dust.
The coming low pressure area will bring heavy rain to parts of the South California coast.
Possible total rainfall by more than half an inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first downpour during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations in the United States can be observed as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp changes in temperature in the near time.
There is a good example of sharp temperature overruns in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moin, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states in the United States, a warm October will begin with a temperature of 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to part of the Northeast.
Temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavan's hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting indications of witnesses on Thursday at the Supreme Court in a case between Brett Cavan and Christina Blacey Ford, which accused him of sexual rape, which presumably occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, broadcasters have interrupted their regular programs in favor of emergency news on Friday: an agreement developed by Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a week-long prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure the drunk Kavana grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a party at an older school.
Cavanaugh, in his stick testimony, said that at 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably over 20.4 million people, of whom the Nielsen Company reported on Friday, looked at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers per CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including the PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And in the company of Nielsen, there are usually problems assessing the people who watch TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing a playoffs or Oscar prize.
\"The Fox News Canal, whose experts decisively supported Cavanaugh's appointment, ran all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,\" stated the Nielsen Company.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
\"The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,\" stated in Nielsen.
Interest remained high and after hearing.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Cavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator to a hearing at the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was lied to, and this was broadcast live on CNN's channel.
\"I'm standing right here in front of you,\" said one woman.
\"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, \"You have power, but many women are deprived of it.\"
Flake said that his office had published a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks spent several hours driving a direct broadcast licence when the Judicial Committee was required to vote on the issue of the selection of Qana's candidacy at the Senate Quorum.
But Flake said he would do it, only realizing that the FBI was considering the charges against the candidate next week, which was called upon by minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to assert Cavana without an investigation.
President Trump started an investigation into charges against Kavan in the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" due to the brexito
During an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May charged critics that she planned to leave the European Union that they were \"playing politics\" with future Britain and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in British Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the first strip of the paper was her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, who opposed her so-called \"cheese\" plan for bract, stating that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EC should have single fares was \"too ridiculous.\"
Wade Sims murder: Police arrested a suspected LSU player Dateseon Simpson die.
The police arrested a suspected deadly shot at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from a team at the University of Louisiana.
\"20-year-old Daytheon Simpson was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges,\" reported the Baton Rouge Police Manual.
Officials showed videos of shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
\"The police took glasses from the scene and said that Simpson DNA was detected on them,\" reports WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted to a deadly shot at Wade.
\"The rate of bet is set at $350,000,\" Advocate reports.
The East Batan Rouge investigation office published a previous report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a fire wound in the head and neck.
Department of Operation Group of Louisiana State Police, State Police Criminal Laboratory, South University police ask residents of the area for investigation assistance that would contribute to the arrest.
The partner director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, thanked the district's law enforcement authorities for their \"stuttering and striving for justice.\"
Simsu was only 20.
Attacking a growth of 6 feet grew in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
On average last season he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 picks up for the game.
On Friday morning, a coach at the University of Louisiana basketball team, Will Wade, said that the team was \"sustained\" and \"in shock\" from Wade's death.
\"That's what I always care about,\" Wade said.
The volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ashes erupting by the volcano Papacatepetl reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Warning of Stunned Disasters on Saturday suggested that Mexicans keep away from the volcano after activity had been found in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded for 24 hours.
There was a rumour in the center and a push was felt.
Images on social networks have shown that there are thin layers of papal coating on a car windscreen around Mexico City, such as Sochilika.
Geophysics has noticed an increase in volcano activity located 45 miles (72 miles) from the south-east of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as \"Don Goya\" has been maintaining activity since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists the day before the annual vote for independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after supporters of independence faced the police on public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in celebration of the first anniversary of the polarization vote on the separation of Catalonia.
A group of separatists in masks, who were held by the police in public order, cast their eggs and ransacked with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that very day, the fighting broke out when the police used their duchess to restrain the demonstrators.
For several hours, groups fighting for independence who scanned \"Don't forget, don't forgive\" were confronted by unionists present shouting, \"Living Spain.\"
According to local press reports, fourteen people underwent treatment for minor injuries sustained in the course of protest action.
Tensions in the region seeking independence remain high one year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid found illegal but which has been marked by separatist Catalans.
Voters in the vast majority preferred independence, although voter's appearance was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the summer after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The groups in favour of independence spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the National Police of Spain.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
68-year-old Narcissa Termes, an electrician present on the separatist prosthetic along with his wife, said that he no longer hoped for a prospect of independence for Catalonia.
\"Lett we have experienced one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we are tired,\" he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional election last December, the Catalan parties in favor of independence, from all forces, attempted to maintain momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders and ended up either in voluntary exile or imprisonment, waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puch, who records a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
\"Stand all the harder,\" he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Jounkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the election to the European Parliament the following year.
\"The selection as a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Government of Spain,\" he said.
Londonders: Men arrested after they rammed the house on the machine
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly cut into a house in Londonder.
The incident occurred in the Belinagard Cressent area on Thursday about 19:30 a.m. to British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was fired into the car.
As a result of Mang's strike, Livingstone gains victory over Rangers at 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Manny in favor of \"Livingston\" provided them with a victory
The success of Livingstone stunned the Rangers, and this was caught up in order to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
The impact of Dolly Manny was great because Gary Holt rose to one level with the Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team this season won't win a premiere trip and next Sunday will meet the leaders, the Harts' team, who are lagging behind for eight points.
Prior to this, Rangers in the League of Europe takes on Thursday's Vienna Paradise.
\"Livingston,\" meanwhile, continued his lost series in the division to six games, and the main coach Holt still feels a parasite after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
\"Livingston\" misses chances due to rough visitors
Holt's team had to advance long before they killed, but the same direction caused Rangers to have a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Litgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halket's blow.
The lords were glad to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guests at some point.
And that is how the main goal was achieved.
A fine strike was allowed on the Rangers side, and Livingstone worked the debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to overcome the Menga who made the pass and killed from the center of the field.
By this point Rangers dominated, but it turned out that team protection was unfit, and goaltender Leah Calley was virtually unengaged
It also continued in the second half, though Alfred Marelas did indeed save Callie.
The ball from Scott Pitman was repelled by the Rangers gatekeeper, Alan McGregor, and Litgov far departed from the second sett of \"Livingston\".
Balls were constantly caught in the \"Livingston\" gate and were repelled, while the two requirements of the toolbar, after Halket was summoned to replace Glen Middleton, and the demand for punishment for the game by hand, were rejected.
\"Fenomen\" from \"Livingston\" - analysis
BBC Journalist Scottland Alessdeir Lamant in Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal Proficiency and Results for Livingston.
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and composition have virtually changed since they returned to the higher echelon, but it is important to give proper Holt for how he stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grand, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo held Conar Goldson and Joe Warall everywhere in the field.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match with the ball they did not possess, only once killing at the gate, which was something like an alarming call for Rangers that ended up in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, we saw smiles and felt groundless flying when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore the relationship between the Allies on NATO.
They quarreled over human rights problems, freedom of the press, and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdogan headed for Cologne to open up a new giant ball.
This city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside of Turkey.
The police saved themselves on security grounds, so as not to give a crowd of 25,000 men to assemble before the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect disagreements over the guest whom one German Turks declared a hero and others condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: Ravarist died when facing a car
The ravarist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of the streets of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast city, around 10:15 a.m. by British time.
The car driver stopped, medical personnel arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another ravarist died as a result of a collision at Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday accident.
Steel police have stated that their employees are working to identify the person and inform his or her closest relatives.
Road fences and bus stops are located near that location, and motorists have been recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Turma: Six employees injured during riots
\"Six prison officials were injured as a result of riots in a strict regime prison for men,\" reports the Penitentiary Office.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Woostershire around 09:30 on British time on Sunday and continue until now.
In order to combat the unrest in which eight prisoners placed in one wing are involved, the Tarnad Special Group was attracted.
At the scene of the event, employees underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said, \"Specially trained prison personnel were directed to fight those who committed riots in the Long Lartin prison.\"
Six employees underwent treatment after receiving injuries.
We do not wipe out violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind the crates.\"
the king's Long Lartin prison contains over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been treated at the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And last October, police officers in public order were summoned to prison to deal with the serious riots during which employees were attacked with swords for the Waterpole.
The Rose Hurricane threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which may be on dry regions useful)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but this is exactly what might happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining traces of the Rose hurricane in the southwest part of the desert that form the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on Monday and Tuesday on sudden floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Tuesday Rose will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain on the evening Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only \"ten tropical cyclones brought tropical storm or pressure falls within 200 miles of the Phoenix since 1950!
\"Catrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona state border.\"
The latest model of the National Center of Hurricanes predicts the fallout of precipitation from 2 to 4 inches, with a level of 6 inches in the area of Magalion in Arizona at individual locations.
In other areas of the south-west, deserts, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely fall from 1 to 2 inches away, with individual resulting values being 4 inches apart.
For those outside the borders of the risk of sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could have been long awaited because their region suffers from drought.
Although flood is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be beneficial because droughts are now being observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing an extraordinary second category drought,\" reportsweather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to landslides on the Mexican half-life of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so tire out.
Thus, it is expected that there will be a river exit from the shores day or night on Monday in Mexico when a tropical storm arrives.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which will create a significant risk of flooding.
\"The total rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwest Sanlra, where rainfall to 10 inches is possible,\" reportsweather.com.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border early on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move through Arizona and the southern part of the state of Utah until Tuesday evening.
\"The main danger is expected from Rose or her remains, these are very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwestern Sanora and Southwestern desert of the United States,\" reported the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and village flows and landslides in a mountainous area.
Attack at Middlesameer Norton: four attempts to arrest murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old guy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with many knife wounds at Samersett.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Exelsior district of Middlesameer Norton about 4 o'clock on Saturday.
It was delivered to the hospital where it remains in a \"stable\" state.
\"17-year-old guy and both, 18-and 20-year-olds, were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon, and Samersett,\" the police told.
The police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on the cell phone of what happened to advance further in their quest.
\"Cavano pervades from the subjugation and anger of the Democratic Party,\" said Trump.
\"The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for the abolition of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,\" reported Trump at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump stated that Cavanaugh is \"boiled from the undertone and anger\" of the Democratic Party in the course of the process of his being elected to the post.
Cavanaugh gave indications before Congress on Thursday, intensively and emotionally denying Christine Blacey Ford's accusations that he had sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave indications during the hearing of her accusation.
On Saturday, the President stated that \"on this day Americans saw the brilliant, qualitative, and courageous character\" of Cavanaugh.
\"The voice in support of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,\" he said to a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly saved himself to the Kavano election by talking about the importance of the Republicans' ulcer during the interim election period.
\"Five weeks are left up to one of the most major elections of our time.
I'm not just late, but really late,\" he answered.
\"That's why I compete everywhere for big candidates.\"
Trump is frustrated that Democrats intend to \"contrast and hinder\".
\"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the hay level on the election of Cavanovo will take place no later than Friday,\" said CNN Senior Assistant Parliamentary Leadership.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of people affected by the rise
\"At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the impact of giant waves on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami began on Sulawesi's Indonesian island,\" stated on Saturday power.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves six feet (18 feet) were beating about the shore in the twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
A tsunami followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
\"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,\" said a press secretary to the Indonesian disaster eradication agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at Jakarta.
\"The tsunami pulled cars, logs, houses, striking everything about the ground,\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 km /ch (up to 497 miles /h) before striking the coastline.
According to him, some people survived just because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 center of Palu.
Aerophotographs published by the Stunned Disasters Agency showed that many buildings and stores were destroyed, bridges rotated and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following pushbacks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage \"wider\" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without news.
\"Awls and damage may be greater along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palo, an area called Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake,\" Nugroh said.
The connection at Dongal was \"was completely damaged,\" with Nugroh being dispersed.
\"There are over 300,000 people living,\" says the Red Cross statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were sent to affected areas.
\"It is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,\" he said.
On Saturday, agencies were widely criticized for not reporting tsunamis in Paul, but officials state that waves were coming at the time a warning was made.
In amateur images published on social networks, you can hear a man on the top floor of the building despairingly yelling people in the street warning of the upcoming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water fell ashore, pulling buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the validity of the material removed.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power cut that disrupted communications around Pale, so it was difficult for the authorities to recall rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the troops began directing freight planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very needed food and other first-use items.
The city's airport was open only to provide assistance and will close until October.
On Sunday, President Joca Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pala.
The tsunami in Indonesia resulted in the loss of over 800 people
This is very bad.
\"while World Vision employees from Danggala have successfully made their way to the city of Palo, where workers hide themselves in the brisk hovels set up in the yard of their office, on the way they saw scenes of devastation,\" said Mr. Doseba.
\"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,\" he told.
This is very bad.
Even when relief groups began grim actions to launch relief mechanisms in disasters, some complained that foreign workers possessing deep knowledge were prevented from going to Paul.
According to Indonesian rule, funding, supplies, and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
\"It is still a disaster at the provincial level,\" said Aulia Arriani, press secretary to the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government declares, \"OK, this is a national disaster,\" we will be able to open up for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their close wonder , would be among those who would leave an indescribable storyline of stun disasters.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been under ruins for two days, and near her was her child's body.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism team, prepared two of the missing paraplanes for Asian Games, which were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
\"As an elder in the field of paraplanerism I have my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Mr. Gendon told how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the paraplanetist community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to participants in Palu who were at the beach festival.
His messages were nevertheless marked with one grey-headed, not two blues.
\"It means the messages weren't delivered,\" he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the filling of ATMs in Newport on Levi
\"In the morning on Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from Brinka's employee who had been booking bills at a ATM in Newport in Libya,\" reported in a press release of the Newport Police Department.
\"The driver of the car emptyed the ATM in a fun complex and prepared to deliver more money,\" wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in release.
While he was busy, another man \"failed because of Brinco's worker\" and stole the fur with the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police failed to clarify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their persons should contact Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Keyney West: Reper changes his name to Ye (\"you\").
Reper Kayne West (Kanye West) changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the change of name to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I appear officially known as Keyney West.
West, who is 41 years old, named Ye, used this nickname as the name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
Changes occur on the eve of his appearance in Saturn's Night Live where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces Ariano Grande's singer with a show that has been cancelled for \"emotional reasons,\" said the show's creator.
Similar to the contraction of his present professional name West had previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
I believe \"ye\" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is \"you,\" said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the album's name with radio lead Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, all of this is us.
It came from \"Kaini\", which means \"one\", to simply Ye\" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our depravity, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Doddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West employee, Jay Zi, also went around without compounding or header letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against peaceful residents
The elected President of Mexico, AndrÃ©s Manuel Lopez Abraham, pledged never to use military force against the civil population as the country approaches the age of 50 from the day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, at Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez Abrador vowed \"never use the military to subjugate the Mexican people.\"
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired a peaceful demonstration on an area that resulted in the deaths of about 300 people, while left-wing student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abraham pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those studying, thus opening more free places at state universities.
\"Wireless and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs,\" he stated.
The United States must double funding for machine intelligence
\"As China becomes increasingly active in the area of machine intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research in this field,\" says an investor and machine intelligence specialist Kay Fu Lee working at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made allegations about MI, even when there is no official MI strategy in the U.S..
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030 it is trying to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
\"The doubling of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area,\" Lee said.
\"A double funding may double the likelihood that the next big MI achievement will get to the United States,\" stated Lee at CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Highlands of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Howton Mifflin Harcourt, is the principal executive director of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Melan University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American player Attel, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese department in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as robotics competitions by the Agency for Forward Defense Research Projects, and asked if there would be the next one to help identify the following stakeholders.
\"U.S. researchers often have to work a lot to get government grants,\" Lee reported.
\"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's corporations,\" Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed lighthouses in recent years from universities to work on MI.
Lee stated that changing immigration policies could also help the United States consolidate its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
\"In my opinion, green cards should automatically be offered to MI candidates,\" he said.
China's State Council released a next generation machine intelligence development plan in July 2017.
\"The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other state organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,\" said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, in which partners from industry and science circles should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Machine Intelligence Special Committee.
And in this month, the forward research project agency in the defence field announced an investment of $2 billion called AI Next.
What is true of the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission on machine intelligence, did not monitor the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on changing the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted at a referendum to change their name to the \"Republic of North Macedonia\", which would allow a ten-year dispute with Greece to be resolved, which blocked bids to participate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, states that her northern neighbour's name represents a claim to her territory, and vetoed the entry into NATO and EC.
In June, both governments concluded the deal given the proposed new name, but nationalist co-workers argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote at the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter's appearance would meet the minimum of 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question of voting at the referendum suggests, \"You're for NATO and EC membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece.\"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a cost that should be paid for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's fall.
\"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,\" said Oliver Georgiewski, 79 years old, Skopje.
While this is not a binding legal force, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it crucial.
Changing the name will require more than two thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no violations until 1 hour of the day.
However, the appearance was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when it voted 66 percent of registered voters.
\"I have come to vote for the sake of my children, our place is in Europe,\" stated a 62-year-old voter in the Skopje capital, Jose Tanewski.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritz and his son DuÅ¡ka voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the name of the country, which will open the way for her to enter NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scene and layouted chairs in front of tents set by those who would boycott the referendum.
\"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to merge with the heads raised, not through the service door,\" said Kawadarkov.
\"We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zayev stated that friendship in NATO would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate was over 20 percent.
\"I believe that the overwhelming number will be \"for\", because over 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,\" said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the result of \"yes\" would be \"affirming our future\".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, it is said that a referendum will take part in 30 to 43 percent of voters, which is below the requisite appearance.
Another survey conducted by Macedia TV showed 57 percent of those surveyed planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they voted \"yes\".
For a successful video referendum, there should be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the passing government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City passes through the gate through all of Brighton's defenses
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with defense from Brighton by winning Manchester City at 2:0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute, Aguer did so easily.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field.
He strove between the three \"Brightan\" defenders before striking into the open field.
Then Aguera found herself among four green shirts.
He walked over one defender and overtaken a few more at the edge of the Brightonian field.
He then pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first touch in penalty gave the ball to Aguer, who used his right kick to bypass the Brighton gatekeeper Matthew Ryan hitting the right side of the network.
\"Aguera has some problems with her feet,\" said the journalist of the city of Pep Guardian.
\"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at that very moment.\"
But it was Sirling who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the fight in the Premiere.
This goal occurred at 29th minute.
Aguera received this ball in the depths of Britanus territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Le Roy Sane.
Seine made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far side of his pants.
The attacking \"Skay Blues\" directed the ball into the net before the one jumped abroad.

Schercer wants to play the role of \"selective points\" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the competition in the playoffs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But constantly competitive Schercer hopes to take a blow on Sunday against the Rocky Colorado, but only when there will still be consequences of playoffs for Rocky remaining in leaders after one game from Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
Rocky has conquered at least a definite place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still hopes to get their first title in the division.
\"Even though we play simply so, at least, we can handle the situation by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will fold so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I have encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this competition?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Schercer a ball in such a situation.
Schercer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a CPI session on Thursday and will be on Sunday on normal vacation.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly saved himself to the situation around his choice of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Republicans' yawn in intermediate elections.
\"All we have done is at risk in November.
Five weeks from one of the most major choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm struggling everywhere for the big candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're full of determination to regain power, using whatever means you need, you see, to be a daisy, mere.
They care whom they offend, whom they must break to gain power and control, is what they want, it is power and control that we are not going to give them.\"
According to him, Democrats intend to \"contrast and hinder.\"
\"And you see it in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"wicked, mean, repulsive, and lying.\"
He was saved to the Senate Judicial Committee to still recognize the Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Feinstein, who received a loud assessment from the audience.
\"Remember her answer?
Did you let the document escape?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen.\"
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It is an intolerance of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a number of members of Parliament from the Labour Party to whom we are told we are not welcome - all to express our opinion.
My colleague for Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she decisively opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship revealed to me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting, which was held Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, says that \"we want these meetings to be lively and productive.\"
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament by the Labour Party it was such meetings that were on Friday
Unfortunately today at most meetings the tone is not that and the promise of a \"more good, softer\" policy is long forgotten when really ever.
This is becoming increasingly apparent that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is valued from that perspective, it is acceptable to party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed I was sharing the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would not have mentioned in any way - in matters of national security either by a single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a tyradish of insults on social networks, in which they call for the revoking of elections, condemning the policies of the center, saying that I am no longer in the Leibarist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been luckyd more than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am delighted by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racist pretences daily, but are never avoided.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Over the past week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labourers' Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
Reality is such that we are no longer an organization that holds different views, and with every movement of \"inevitability\" or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice that called me not to fall in the spirit, not to be so loud, and then with me everything will be fine.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Leybarists 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Tetcher government, which is why my study in school failed, I have sought to stand up the best public services for those who need them most - let it be a local resident or government minister.
I never hid my political views, including in past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way entangle in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when a country is headed towards Brexit, which carries damage to the household, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and strength on my allegiance to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it is my voters, whether it be members of the Labourists, or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat of revoking the elections will be and political feasibility will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ir Melrovz 38 - 17: Invincible Ayr on top
Two recent attempts may have skewed the end result somewhat, but no doubt Ayr earned the triumph in this remarkably interesting Tennant Premier League match.
They now designate a tournament table, the only side of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just as their best chances made them masters, coach Peter Murch's merch had the full right to be satisfied.
\"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy,\" he said.
Robin Christy of Melrows said, Give proper Air; he dared more than we.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scottland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the game Warriors, allowed Melruz to jingle the numbers, and Jason Baggott grasped for an unrealized attempt.
The climactics stretched Air Leader by means of a toolbar before, right in the break, he killed and then turned down a solo attempt by making 17-5 Air into a break.
But Melrows had well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bagot, reduced the lag to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of the Ruarid Nott, which was stretched out, and after re-starting the Air advanced further through the attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by the Climates.
Eyre, acting as Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrows forced another man to pay by means of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colwin at the end of February pressure.
However, the masters returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for kicking the Climb without a ball from a line of finess, McPherson landed behind the Air.
The climactics implemented their attempt, which did again almost after re-starting, after Kyle Rowe received the blow of David Armstrong in fine and sent flanker Gregor Henry to fifth attempt the masters of the field.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurant business
However, the star of Ford Kieran's game is about to enter the hotel business industry after it turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes, and takes off along with Greg Hemphil's long-standing comedy partner.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show series, and it seems Kernan plans to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in the \"flowering trade in Glasgow\".
\"The sea is ours\": Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will re-open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, we draw the motto \"More Is Our Right.\"
To recover is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost by Chile in bloody conflict due to resources of the 19th century, is still alive - as is the urge to sail back into the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached a maximum top over the past few decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1, after five years of discussion.
\"Bolivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course she waits for a positive result,\" said Bolivian diplomat Rabert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will monitor the decision of the MC on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of intense negotiations, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is committed to negotiating to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Morales is a charismatic president of Bolivia who faces a conflicting struggle for re-election next year.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific,\" he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that will make little difference even if it does.
The UN organization based in the Netherlands is not eligible to make a decision on Chile's territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice only goes forth six months after the final arguments were examined indicates that the case was \"not complicated,\" said a Chilean expert in the field of international law, Mr. Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have thrown her back.
\"The problem of sea access has been monopolized by the present Bolivian administration,\" Sarat said.
According to her, Marales' militant rhetoric has lost the residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but following that, holding discussions will be very difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edward Rajiguez Welt, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that making a decision by the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia a \"exclusive opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile\" and an opportunity to \"put an end to 139 goad differences with mutual benefit,\" he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Marales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the sea problem as a political stronghold.
\"Bolivia never give up its right of access to the Pacific,\" he added.
\"Constitution is the ability to see that we need to overcome the past.\"
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between leaders.
His comments come as U.S.A. Secretary of State Mike Pompey is similar to being on the verge of restoring nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Chen Yin more than three months after Singapore .
Rie says it is a \"unforgettable dream\" to the continued sanctions and objection to the United States' declaration of ending the war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang does not first initiate significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump require a second summit to be held.
But there is great skepticism about Pyongyang's taking seriously the rejection of an arsenal that the country is likely to view as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeia plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive headwear on the way to shops in your cities
If you want to increase your hat collection or close the sun completely, you can no longer search.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented many unusual headwear on the podium for their SS19 collection, which crossed the expectation from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has won the popularity of non-practical hats whose designers have sent their creations to a podium.
The prominent feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat decorated with broad fields similar to feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included decorated gemstones, wizard hat, and even pineapple, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tim Brown also showed a pick-up of wise masks - just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were with tightened lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One was similar to a drawing for underwater swimming with a tube and guard glasses, and the other was similar to a molten cone of ice cream.
And if you keep following the enormous attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can break into our everyday lives.
The huge-sized hats go heels to \"La Bomb\", a straw hat with fields two feet wide, which can be seen in all, from Rianna to Emily Rataykowski.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was dissolved on social media, contributed to another big creation on the podium--a straw beach bag, almost as large as a model with that bag dressed in a merchant.
A dark orange bag with raffy decorated with acne with raffy and covered with a white leather handle became an outstanding part in the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 at Week of Fashion in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to F.E.: \"I expect to see big hats and beach poops on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a huge impact, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for non-gamut accessories.\"
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland keep achievements in academic success, this continues with 2018 with another excellent outcome of exams, which is underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other beginnings of the community.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and incorporate an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"When you speak to a person in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.\"
It is a vivid reminder that we cannot hope only in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's last exams, we see that languages occupy the first places in league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of the students reached higher grade A in learning Chinese, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish, also reached the level of A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject are now chosen just like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers brought about due to difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were associated with lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills become a necessity to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs requiring knowledge of languages, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
No matter who the profession will abhor, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you possess such skills for life.
The ability to contact directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person first among competitors.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 British adults took part, 75 percent were not able to speak the foreign language well enough to speak the language, and French was the only language in which the two-digit percent spoke 15 percent.
That's why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the United Kingdom when looking at the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice from multiple languages with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools seek to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and arm their skills needed to achieve success no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at present that in a global business environment languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as \"the skills of international communication\".
Independent schools will and further offer this choice, diversity, and advantage to the youth of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward - Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts on Sunday to San Diego
A wait start for supporters who want to see Lebron James make his first start at `Loss Angeles Lakers'
Coach-Leikers- Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-sessional opening Sunday against the Denver Nagets- in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will play, still need to be determined.
\"It will be more than one and less than 48,\" Walton stated at the official Lakers website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
According to the practice that came this week.In James, they asked about his plans for \"six game pre-session graphs\".
\"I don't need pre-session games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,\" he said.
Trump time of performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Today in Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump starts many shares of the company.
This is the first of five planned Trump speakers next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
When confirming the vote to arrive at an election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of those who have an intermediate election to take place, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's performance begin tonight in West Virginia and how do you view it on the Internet?
Trump's performance at Wiling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's performance in West Virginia on the Internet below on direct air on YouTube.
Trump is most likely to consider this week's hearings on the candidacy of the Bretta Cavanaugh Supreme Court, which has trouble on the grounds of sexual harassment charges with the expected confirmation in the Senate of a vote during the week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speakers is to assist Republicans who stand before the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speakers next week were aimed at \"enacting the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,\" reports Reuters.
\"The control behind Congress is so important to it the order of the day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, as we enter into the stressful season of the pre-election campaign,\" said the Reiter Agency representative of Trump's company.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena arena in Wiling, today's stock can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pizzburg media,\" reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be second together in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
\"It is not a very good sign for Morris that the president must come to try to give him the push in the polls,\" said Simon Hedar, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia, reports to Reuters.
Rider's Cup 2018: US team advances to fight to keep hope of living on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, the four Saturday afternoons may have been exactly what is needed for this Ryder Cup.
The pulse-winning pendulum is a fully invented partnership concept that players sincerely believe in, and nothing more than similar competition.
So where would they say impulse now?
\"They had an advantage with six points, and now they had four, so I think we're going through it with a little pulse,\" said Jordan Sleeping, walking through the day.
The advantage of Europe is, of course, four points forward, and there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans, Spith says, feel that they have slightly blown the wind, and they have something to hope for, not least, because of the shape of Spyt and Justin Thomas who played together all day long, and each can boast three points of four.
Spight was deadly from t-shirts to greens and is an example.
These larynx cries of celebration became all louder as his round lasted, and he trampled a decisive blow to play the match on four fields when they and Thomas gave way to two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, like one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
\"You just need to go deeper and worry about your own match,\" Spyti said.
Already each of these players has left.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spate and Thomas are Francesco Mallinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniably story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
\"Maliwood\" was the only pair who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and afternoon on Friday.
This happens, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, and it confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and would not have been more popular a player to close the potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than the Fleetwood or the Malinary.
Wanted are both simultaneously on different holes.
Talking about European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sirgio Garcia, the hero of the morning fursett when he was married to Alex Noren.
The Godgs and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spanish and shewed him, from which they were never able to climb.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Following the matches of four balls and fours is so interesting to observe carefully because of the interaction between making pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't perform, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has by now become a better team and has taken a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth meeting it is also shown that the U.S. team strives to fight in which some have questioned, especially in the States.
Europe goes out to the Rider Cup final at 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Rider Cup after it comes out of Saturday's four ball match and four with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet by Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Mallinari marked a struggle with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results to Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, reigned in the American disgruntled agency in the morning, gaining a series of 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the four ball match by winning two matches, but they failed to make more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furika's side needs eight points out of 12 single matches on Sunday.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Mallinary, who was named Molliwood after sensational weekends, is just the second pair to win four points for their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four swords, they marvelled to defeat the dropped Woods and American recruit Brison Decomb's still 5 and 4.
Woods, who held himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random burst of lust, but now he lost 19 of 29 times in the four ball and four match and seven in a row.
Justin Rowes, rested on the x matches of four swords, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the four ball matches to the defeat of 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki --takes one and second place in the world.
Europe had no way of it, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of west of Paris.
On Saturday the three-time major winner, Jordan Spight and Justin Thomas, set up a control point for Americans with two points.
They earned a 2 and 1 victory over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in the four ball matches and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in the four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team come back from a four point deficit that goes alone, although towards Furica owners only need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days that were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they were getting everything.
North Korea says \"no way\" will disarm in a one-way manner without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations continues with sanctions that strengthen the credibility of the United States, and in such circumstances the country cannot give up nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner.
Ri Yun Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the World Authority that last year North Korea adopted \"substantial good-will measures,\" such as stopping tests at nuclear and missile sites, demating nuclear testing zones and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"One day we don't see an appropriate response from the United States,\" he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States there will be no certainty of our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way primarily to disarm ourselves in a unilateral manner.\"
Despite Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a \"step-by-step\" approach to dynaucleorization, within which North Korea was rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement proved significant in that he did not deny the unilateral declaration of deuclearization that had been done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri saved himself to Kim Chen Yin and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first U.S. President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work towards the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", with Trump promising to give security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to abolish severe international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The United States of America first insists on 'denucleorization' and increasing pressure levels by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war',\" says Ri.
\"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is the unforgettable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepens our credibility.\"
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Mun Je-in in the past five months and added, \"If participants in this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not become such a deadlock.\"
However, Ri's tone of speech was sharply different from the previous year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly claiming that targeting the U.S. continent using North Korea's missiles was inevitable after \"Mr. President of Evil\" Trump called Kim a \"rocket\"-self-restraint.
This year, UN Trump, who threatened to \"tall destroy\" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his boldness in taking measures to disarm, but said that there would still be a lot to do, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, \"If this takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia argue in UN. The Security Council stated that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary. Mike Pumpeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"Executing Security Council sanctions should actively and definitely continue until we are sure of complete, final, and verified dinucleization.\"
The Security Council strengthened sanctions regarding North Korea in 2006 by attempting to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompey met with Ri in the Security Council colloirs.The General Assembly then stated that in the following month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompei had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he left Pyongyang stating that the progress made with North Korea during several hours of negotiations had ended with a visa statement that he was submitting requirements \"likely to gangsters.\"
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to eliminate the missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States took \"appropriate measures\".
Trump said that, according to Kim, \"the appropriate measures\" he is expecting are a security guarantee and an effort to normalize the relationship with Washington, D.C. that Trump has promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a proper rest course.
The new Harvard University course this year should teach students to sleep more, and has the goal of struggling with culture to study overnight with coffee in their hand.
The scientist concluded that students in one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to care for themselves and their health properly.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist named Brigham and female hospital, developed a course that he believed is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the statement about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture one girl came up to me and said, \"Why did I be told this just now, in the last grade of teaching?\"
\"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping - it surprised me,\" he said The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught to a student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Service, told us that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were often sleep-free for a week.
A course that lasts an hour involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter there is an image of a room on the internet where students click on coffee cups, curtains, and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects sports indicators as well as the importance of habits before sleeping.
At the onset, participants are told how years of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, calls on participants to think about their daily lives.
\"We know that this will not change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe they have to know it the same as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health,\" Professor Chaseler added.
According to him, the culture of night dinners still exists, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be a growing problem.
\"Ensure sufficient sleep of good quality must be a \"secret weapon\" of students to deal with stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,\" he said, \"even to avoid excess weight as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.\"
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaseler in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to educate everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask for the ear of the Assyrians to complete a similar curriculum before going to university.
Professor Chaseler recommended that students be able to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of \"bluelight\" emitted from monitors screens and LED lights that can change the day-to-day mode, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Mengo kills Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered another parasite when the goal of Dolly Manny made sure that Stephen Gerard would not receive a 1:1 parasite at the Livingstone Stadium.
Aybrax wants to record his first victory on his way to triumph with the number 4-1 in February at St. John's, but Gerry Holton's team is already carrying a second defeat to Gerard as manager of 18 games to leave eight points on their side, lagging behind the prime leaders of Ladbrokes Hearts.
The mengoes struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not look as if they were shaking the parasite.
While Rangers descend to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to the third place, behind remain Hiburnian with difference in swords.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after the forward Calum Spence has to be treated from head injury after the subject thrown from the stands has fallen into it.
Gerard made eight player changes, which is why Ira did not play in the Betfred Cup's semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy under 11 that allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted with how well they were at each step bypassing their opponents.
Rangers were more ball-owned, but Livingston made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill after two minutes already, when the first time Menga directed the ball through Scott Pitman to the gates of Alan McGragler, and then a half-protector used that chance.
A successful fine strike by Jacobs Keigan matured against Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgov, was able to strike a strong blow behind.
Rangers seized control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hoping to kill than they demonstrated a good game.
Alfred Marelas certainly had to be punished with a fine a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lowles encountered themselves in the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the complaints of Colombia.
Rangers managed to hit the gate in only the first half of the game, but the former Aybrox goalkeeper, Liam Calley, nearly gave the goal to Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack of Ovi Eharya.
Although killing the first goal on the 34th minute of Libya may have been against a further active game, no one denies that they have to demonstrate the stutterer a good game.
Again, Rangers failed to break the Jacobs Gate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Menga to get the opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced the Kulibali break with Ryan Kent, and this had an effective effect when attacking a swoop to Marellas, but impressive Callie ran and blocked the blow.
But Livingston continued to please visitors by playing that game, which was what he liked, and Litgov and Halket went on to share the ball after a long opposition.
Holt's box was only able to prevail for the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to confront Jacobs before Litgow went on a bench of spares.
The replacement of Rangers by Glen Middleton occurred alternately once after he was fined when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanac: Heiger's Inventor.
The page from our almanac \"sunday morning\": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLICKI...the day of the future physicist Ian Wilhelm \"Hance\" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity resulting in the appearance of a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Called Koranade, in which those seemingly notorious scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
A man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: - This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you overlay headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that are given off by radioactivity in minerals*
Evans: \"say it really shakes now?\"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues to use.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system \"see\" cancer cells.
A new anti-rac vaccine can help the immune system \"see\" bad cells and destroy them.
Vaccination is like teaching an immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Cells can then \"see\" a protein that is common in many cancer cells and then re-enter helpful cells.
A trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who has been introduced a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has seen that ovarian cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can \"see\" the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then be re-entered.
This was stated by Professor Jay Bersofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethes State Maryland.Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
\"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-racous cells that combat lung cancer, ovarians, lungs, and colon cancer,\" told Professor Berosophsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and \"learning\" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanya West proceeded to debate in support of Trump, bearing the title MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
What didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday evening Kanya West was derided after a performance where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would hurt for a second term in 2020.
After performing an evening of his third song called \"The City-Privid\" when he was in the \"Make America Again Large\" hat, he opposed the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
\"How many times do I speak to the whites, and they said, How can you support Trump, is he the racist?\"
\"Well, if I were to bother because of racism, I would have left America for a long time,\" he said.
The SNL began a show involving the main role of Damon's goal, where Hollywood star engaged over the indications of Brett Cavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee while dealing with Christine Blasy Ford's sexual rape case.
Despite not being broadcast, West's words hit the frame and were uploaded to social media by Comics Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had had a hard time behind the bullets.
They were pretending to be behind me.
They said, \"Don't go out there with this bad stuff.
They were pretending to be on me.
\"And then they say that I am in a dying place,\" he said, as the Washington Examiner newspaper reports.
West went on: Do you want to see the gypsy place? \"Keeping that he\" would put on my hat, Skperman, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to love.
Due to his statements, at least twice the hearing was withdrawn, and SNA representatives were puzzled by the message from Veraiti. \"The whole studio was silenced.\"
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, MacMiller's rapper, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by the performance of the I Love It song dressed in a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative party, Candes Turner, who wrote in tweet, \"One of the most brave spirits thank you for your support.\"
But the leading talk show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just the one he is and it's always wonderful.
\"But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his \"art\" which I believe embraces and unwinds the ideology which causes harm to my community.
He is free.
Just like us,\" she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now \"officially called Cayne West\".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went in the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Puff Diddie.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion's calves and of course a legend of music that changed his name to a symbol and then still he and the artist, formerly known as a prince.

Keith Harrington's Star of Thrones gripped by idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and John Snow's role in the series \"HBO's Games\" in the Middle Ages fighter HBO's
But a 31-year-old actor has received a macho hero stereotype, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking in the Culture Department of Sunday Times, Keith said he thought \"something happened\" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who had recently married his neighbor on the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted to feeling power over solving this problem.
\"I feel personally strong guy--when we were wrong with courage?\" he said.
\"Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?\"
Keith believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to very male characters.
He continued, \"What lies at the beginning and why is this taught?
Why teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they should be so confident to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest issues in our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the next summer series would end, and he would leave the battlefield of the series and do not do docks or sequels to the \"Game of Thrones\".
From November, Keith will begin to revive the Real West Sam Shephard, who is a historical director with his brother who is a burglar.
Recently, the actor reported that he considered meeting with his wife, Rows, a better opportunity to finish the \"The Game of Thrones\".
\"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life is here,\" he said.
Rose played Igrit (Ygritte), a character in which she is in love with Keith's hero John Snow in this fancy series awarded to \"Emi\".
The couple declared themselves in June 2018 at Leslie Manor in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to health workers, over 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases have been passed through sex as it has been in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
\"One day the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions dropped to almost zero,\" Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, with each year, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China will grow by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is China's acute problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination towards the LGBT people is still eating.
Due to conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases spread from lack of knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies a spill of data, dangers, and theory of conspiracies by her members of Parliament
US Congressionalman Maxine Waters broke off on Saturday charges that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claim was to the upper-right wing participants and their sites.
\"A lie, a lie, and much abominable lies,\" says the Waters statement in Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States.Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information posted by an unknown man on the Capital Hill during hearings by the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Assessments regarding a member of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The leak took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
\"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source IP address was linked to the Waters office and shared information to an employee of the Waters team,\" reports Hill.
\"This misleading statement is completely false and absolutely false,\" Waters continued.
\"Child my teams, whose data, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these delusional and false accusations, were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This misleading statement is completely false and absolutely false.\"
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Arry Fleischer.
\"It's a refusal to cause anger,\" wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of not doing, they should not get angry.
They do not have to lead themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives behind their accusation.
They must be calm and good-natured.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too angry during their hearings on Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate for the Republican Party who chatted and participated in meetings in the interim elections, was also expressed in Twitter.
\"It's a resonance when it turns out to be true,\" he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false claims.
\"We guarantee that the guilty will be found,\" she continued, \"and they will bear legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees.\"
Overview Johnny English Strikes Again strikes Rowen Atkinsan's fictional spy.
It has now become a tradition to search for the meaning of BRECSITU in any new movie with a British hive, and this hive seems to be in comedy and an Executive-Franche Johnny Inglish, which began back in 2003 with Johnny Inglish and lasted in 2011 under the title \"Emergence of Johnny Inglish\".
Will the satire be able to cut out well on how obvious the nonsense we look when we talk about new export possibilities?
At any rate, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny Inglish was given the opportunity to pass over things--his name was louder than all the comical creations that he had done for non-English spectators in cinematography.
Of course, he is a secret agent, who, despite his wise claim to the glamour, won a little like Cluzo with the features of Mr. Bean and a little taco guy who contributed a single note to the Khor fire at the 2012 London Olympics Opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on Atkinson's wandering and international mysteries, which he once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few pleasant moments here that were not before.
I loved Johnny Inglish, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval good fortunes, and the rotator's ankles knock a little bit at his helmet.
Dar Atkinson for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but humor is felt weak, and so is surprising especially when serious films such as \"An Agent 007: Mission Unexecuted\" surely offer comedy as the main part.
Humour feels as if it is not only for adults, but also for children, and even the mindless accidents Johnny Inglish is not as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the face of Bin.
Long-term current thought provoking are serious UK problems.
Cyber-hacker insight into the super-secreting community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the duty agent is, unfortunately, Kevin Eldan's small role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed person who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this quasi-Terazei-May, but there is nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every actual spy will be revealed, she will have to engage some of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny Inglish himself, everything gets complicated: he is now working as a sixth teacher in several shackle institutions and giving lessons on how to be an uncovered operator: some good examples are here since Inglish offers the Academy of Music lessons spyware.
Inglish has returned to Whitehall for extraneous bring and is reunited with his former perennial friend, Bo, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bo now has a marriage bound to the submarine commander, a role that Vicky Pepperdin played a bit of futile.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Currylene.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous command of a charismatic technical billionaire who claims he can solve problems with UK hackers: with the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Bow start their action out of immediate things: disguise yourself under a waitress, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board the luxury yacht of Volta; Inglish commits a clean anarchy because he tries to use the garlands of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All moments are pulled for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of childish in the television.
Quite a good material.
And how about other films about Johnny Inglish I couldn't think of: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British four-day work week with pay as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbin's working party should consider a radical plan if the British are working only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants business managers to pass on to workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an additional weekend.
It was seen that the staff of the building would enjoy three-day weekends, but would still receive the same salary.
Source notes that the idea is consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The union convention approved the transition for a four day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
An older source in the Labour Party told for The Sunday Times magazine, \"A planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that meets the views in the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day work week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are not generally supported.
A representative of the Labour Party said, The Four-day Work Week is the goal of not party politics, and this is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. Macdonell said that he had decided to return power from \"poor directors\" and \"managers\" to utilities.
The Dark Chancellor's plans also provide that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stock pack because the Labourers government can make a \"account\" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to contribute jobs to company councils and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of private firm's own funds to workers who would contain annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsay Graham, John Cannedy told for \"60 Minutes,\" that FBI investigators working with Cavanaugh should change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bretha Cavano was postponed to a final vote on his election to the Supreme Court for at least a week.The question arises as to whether the findings of the Republican Senators' Bureau could be supported.
In an interview on the air on Sunday, Scott Pelli, a \"60 Minutes\" correspondent, asked Republicans Johnny Cannedy and Lindsay Graham about \"Sense\": whether the FBI could reveal anything that could lead to reversals.
Cannedy proved more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Cannedy.
\"I said, going to the courtroom: I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked about the reason for the charge, asking, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined and unequivocal.\"
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
\"I think Brett Cavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation,\" he said.
\"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett resolutely denies it,\" added Graham, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
\"And everyone she calls was unable to believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new.\"
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is done to reduce poverty?
There is an International Festival in New York City this Saturday: an annual music event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place at the large Central Park Lounge, where tens of thousands will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B, and Sean Mendes's concert, as well as learning about the true goal of the event - stopping poverty and galekeeping by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the gallbladder of an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or \"run the action\", be a volunteer, write by email to the country leader, call any other person, and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was he able to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a costless concert a real way to convince people that they need active action, or is it simply another case of so-called \"cloquism\" - people feel they are doing a good thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers have stated that they have recorded over 19 million \"actions\" from their supporters seeking to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions helped spur influential leaders to fulfill the responsibilities of more than $37 billion that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group produced 390 comments on obligations and applications for at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or compiled.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and executives based in the UK, \"helping children thrive in full volume,\" promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
\"With the support of the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments, and citizens of different countries, we can uproot the social injustice of malnutrition in history,\" said Ambassadar Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares had been conducted, at which time they called in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the \"food aid\" project, which reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website \"what makes you think we can end poverty?\"
The Global Festival replied: This will be a long and hard way; sometimes we will suffer a parasite and failure.
But like great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we'll make success because we're stronger together.

The United States can use the Navy for \"blocks\" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
\"Washington may, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian power from entering the markets of the EZ and Middle East,\" said U.S. secretary Ryan Zink, reporting Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it operates upon the invitation of a legitimate government, were grounds for the study of new energy markets.
\"I believe that the reason they stay in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,\" he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to handle it.
\"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of the Navy, to assure the openness of the seapaths, and when needed, to organize a blockade so that their energy will certainly not get into the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed participants to an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the \"voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
\"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel,\" he said, calling Russia \"one-sided country\" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump Administration wants to greatly increase the export of its contrived natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
For this purpose, Trump's administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to get out of the \"failed\" \"North Stream 2\" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a \"span\" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that North Stream 2 gas pipeline at a cost of $11 billion, which is created to raise the power of existing pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is solely an economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is beginning in economics and is an example of unconscientious competition.
\"I believe that we have a single view of the fact that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers,\" said Secretary of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which again confirmed their favor with the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German directs (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our supply of energy,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Speakrs (BDI) after a recent meeting between Germany's Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss his participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, declares a senator from Massachusetts state
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the election of the President after the interim election.
During a speech at the Hallioki Mayor, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
\"The time has come for women to head to Washington and order our invalid government, and I speak also of women in the highest positions,\" she stated, according to The Hill.
\"After November 6th I will consider very seriously the possibility of running into the president.\"
During a speech at the Mayor Warren abhors himself to President Donald Trump, saying that he would \"lead the country in the wrong direction.\"
\"I am extremely troubled by what Trump is doing with our democracy,\" she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Bretta Cavanaugh Supreme Court.
On Friday, in her tweet Warren wrote \"knowingly, before voting we need the FBI to check the investigation.\"
However, the results of the survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters did not believe that it should be swamped by the president in 2020.
According to a survey of the center of political research at Saffolk University/Boston Globe fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's \"possible\" voters said the senator shouldn't hurt.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Dewall Patrick, where 38 percent was for, and 48 percent against.
Other famous names among Democrats discussed in connection with potential swamping in 2020 include former vice president Joe Byden and senator from the state of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press Byden stated that he would officially make a decision by January.
At the convention in support of Donald Trump Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic Trek Palin syndrome
The 26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called to serve in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
\"What my son goes through after his return, I can compare with the results of post-romatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers return with, in other families,\" she said to be assembled at a convention in support of Donald Trump in Tolsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a \"white issue\" and stated that her son, along with the other war veterans, \"turn a little more, hardened, return with the question of whether there is that respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military, were fighting, giving themselves over to the country.\"
He was arrested on Monday in Usila, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, an obstacle to attempting to report domestic violence, wearing weapons in a drunken state, according to information from Dan Bennett, a press secretary of the Usil police department.
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support the objection to new policies to provide a wharf
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the objection to a new US policy that denies a wharf to victims of harassment by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C. to support the objection to the policy of providing a wharf, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Seshns' case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against Federal Policy, was not revealed.
She stated that her partner \"and his friends from a fierce gang\" had raped her, but the U.S. authorities denied the wharf on July 20.
She was stuck in Texas.
The justices of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which the greatest number of applications for a wharf in the United States come, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American state-of-the-art policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents who are victims of domestic violence to resort to the stay.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Reisin, stated on Friday that the new policy \"ignores decades of legislative experience of states, country and world.\"
\"Federal legislation requires that applications for standing be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a similar change violates this principle,\" says the analytical note.
The jurists also stated in the note that policies that deny immigrants would worsen the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can make themselves entrepreneurs and \"create the necessary jobs.\"
Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered in June that immigration judges no longer give a stay to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
\"Principals are given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a social group or political views,\" said Seshns on June 11, announcing this policy.
The wharf never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Paul. During attempts to find survivors, the number of deaths has doubled
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
\"All too tense,\" says Rhys Cusum's 35-year-old mother, calming her little son with temperature at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palo.
\"Every minute car--quick is bringing bodies.
There is very little clean water.\"
Residents began to return to their broken homes, dissolving all sorts of things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-point magnetization earthquake were crowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who broke the spine and shoulder, are outside of the Army Hospital of Palo, where patients are treated in the street because of the strong pushes that are repeated.
He had tears in his eyes when he recalled the feeling of strong underground jolts in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save.
I was pressed under the ruins of the wall,\" said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for marriage.
\"I heard my wife calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.\"
The American ambassador accuses China of \"threats\" using \"propagandist advertising\"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in an American daily, dissipating the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to Des Moines Register, the state of Iowa's most sold newspaper, after accusing China of attempting to be involved in an election to American Congress on November 6. This accusation China refutes.
Trump's accusation that China had tried to intervene in American elections marked what American officials had named in conversation with Reuters as a new phase in Washington's pressure campaign on China.
Though placing advertising on foreign governments is normal practice to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have now unleashed a trade war resulting in mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, American and Chinese experts said, were introduced to harm exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Brenstead, a U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in a copyrighted article on Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, \"now doubles its efforts by printing propagandist advertisements in our free press.\"
\"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing paid advertising in Des Moines Register,\" Brenstead wrote.
\"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you will find not so many votes against and will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking note of the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China,\" he wrote.
He added that \"one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to offer\" to print his article, although he did not name it.
Republicans repel women voters on the eve of an intermediate election from the Fiasco Cavanaugh, alert analysts
While many prominent Republicans defend the candidate for the position of Chief Justice Brett Cavanaugh in front of the face of several sexual rape accusations, analysts warned that they would receive a blow in response, especially against women, during future intermediate elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are willing to vote.
\"These things can no longer be returned,\" said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, publishing \"The Hill\" for an article that was printed on Saturday.
Richard stated that it is not certain that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizon's) statements of investigation by the FBI would be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
\"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and November,\" stated on Friday Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn paper from Washington, Columbia County.
On Friday morning the protestors scanned \"Lastpad Soon!\" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall when Republicans in control of the legal committee decided to put forward the Kavano candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's statement, in accordance with Mic.
\"Enthusiasm and the motivation of Democrats will be extremely large,\" stated the news site St. Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
\"People say they're already tall, and it's true.
But there may also be even higher ones, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters between 18 and 29 years old who do not like the president, but often do not vote.\"
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her claims to the Supreme Court of Violence Supreme Court, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, they may have a strong impact in return.
\"For the Republican party, this has done some sort of interference,\" said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Party Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"The talk is not about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Cavanaugh's vote is about.A talk about how Republicans did it and how they put themselves before it,\" by Guy Cecil's noticeable news channel, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, similar to the fact that Americans separated into issues of Right-wing Ford or Cavanaugh, with a little more in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents must or may not very certain trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they must or may not very certain trust Cavanaugh.
In addition to this, 38 percent said that they thought Cavanaugh might or must have lied in their statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed by Flake, the FBI investigates accusations from Ford and at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, when he was drunk, was seeking her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court had demonstrated her genitals at a party when they were studying in Eile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a New Internet to compete Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, starts a startup that will be made a competitor to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the Berners-Lee Solid Open Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store the data and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee fired that, creating Inrupt, he meant \"to reign over the world\".
\"It's necessary to do it now,\" he said about the startup.
\"This is a historical moment.\"
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create \"own online data repositories\" or PODs.
This can contain contact lists, case lists, calendars, fanacu, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available immediately on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal data repository online is that only the user determines who has access to which type of information.
The company calls this a \"personal enhancement of potential using data.\"
In the opinion of the executive director of John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together resources, process, and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has bought, several developers working on the contract and the volunteer encoders project.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized programs, using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee stated that he and his team were not talking to \"Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not complete changes if all their business models were instantly reviewed.
\"We do not ask their permission.\"
In Saturday's publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission \"is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.\"
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating web neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Foundation for the Web, and the Open Data Institute.
\"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web,\" added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Wan: the honor of a priest awarded to the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England priest awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a member of the fighting was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Wan was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attack under Belenglysis and Leakour.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper bullet and never learned he had received the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptanshire two of his grandchildren on the parade opened a memorable stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wan, said it was \"very symbolic\" that the stone opens exactly 100 years after being rewarded by his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the de San Quentin Canal \"through a thick impolument and under a strong gunfire and machine gun fire by an accomplice.\"
Then he ran on the line of fire and \"with great boldness\" led the soldier forward, capturing the gun on his own and kicking out the three divisions.
Colonel Wan was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wan said that his grandfather's actions were \"something that I would never be able to do and also something worthy of respect.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, also laid a wreath after a parade headed by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Wan said that \"for him it is a great honour to take part in the parade\" and added that \"the manhood of the true hero was demonstrated by the support that many provide.\"
The fans of MMA waited a whole night to see Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's pig
Just imagine you've stood up all night to see the packed gear from Bellator 206 and then you're denied watching the main event.
There were 13 fighting in the program with San JosÃ©, comprising six on the main map, and they were shown on the live air all night on British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when GÃ©rard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to catch up, viewers in the UK were just stunned when the program changed to Pep's piggyback.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night specifically waiting for this fight.
One of the ballers on Twitter called switching to a child's mulcik as \"anyone's stupid joke\".
In response to the broadcasting question of Dave Schwartz, the Senior Vice President of Bellator on Marketing and Communications said, \"Absolutely the state ruling at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a child program.\"
\"Yes, 'Pepa's Pig'\"
Bellator President Scott Coker said that in the future they would be working on the program to account for British viewers.
\"I think we're talking about the possibility of repetition, in my opinion, we can solve this question,\" said Coker.
\"But now is the sixth morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to decide this by Sunday on our time, and this is Monday on their time.
But we do our best.
Believe me, if the programs have changed, we have received a lot of messages and not all of them have been friendly.
We tried to resolve the issue by believing that it was a technical mistake.
But this proved to be a state rule.
Magu will promise that the next one together like this will not happen.
We're going to lower the number of tails from six to five, as we do normally, this together we wanted to advise the fans, but we got over and over again.
This is an unfortunate situation.\"
The 'Disquiet of the Uninhabited Island': Tom Daley felt \"valueless\" because of sexuality
The Olympic prairie jumper into the water Tom Daley said he was growing up with a sense of slightity for others due to his sexuality - but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that \"not everyone like me\" until he went to high school.
Speaking in Radio 4's \"Diskeys of the Uninhabited Island\" program in leading Laurent Laurent, he said he supported gay rights to give others \"hope\".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning an alimony.
The traditional lead this fairly old Kirsti Young program, took a vacation for a few months due to illness.
In the role of a man who turned out to be on the deserted island, on Lavern's first program, Daley said that as a child, he felt \"less\" for everyone else because \"the society didn't accept those they liked both boys and girls.\"
He said, \"I do now believe that this feeling of that you are not like everything and slight was that which gave me strength and inspiration for success.\"
He wanted to prove that he was \"someone\", he told him not to disappoint those who learned of his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze prism of the Olympics was made a significant activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called upon countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give \"hope\" to others.
A threefold champion of the world said that when he fell in love with a man -- American scriptoress, directors, and presenters, Justin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 -- \"it was unexpected to me.\"
Daley married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but, he said, the difference in age does not matter.
\"When you walk through such at such a young age\" - at the first ally he fell to 14 years old and another three years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to find a balancemaker who would experience such takeoff and fall.
In June they became parents, their son being called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his \"perspectives completely\" changed.
\"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win the gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold Olympic medal.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal.\"
His son is also called as his father, Robert. Father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - he wanted to sit in the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him \"you won't sit in the first row, Dad.\" he said.
\"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
\"I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of all my life--sticking into the water in front of my ballers at the Olympics, that's the best feeling,\" he said.
This also affected the selection of the song -- Proud from Heather Smol -- which found in it feedback in preparation for the Olympics and from which and now the ants flee.
The 'Diskeys of the Uninhabited Island' can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 p.m. on British summer time.
Miquelson, who is not in shape, remains on a bench spare in the Rider's cup on Saturday
American Phil Miquelson will put a record on Sunday by playing his 47 match in the Rider's cup, but he needs to return the form so that this event does not make it miserable.
Miquelson, who will play this competition held once every two years, record the 12th time, team captain Jim FÃ¼rick planted on bench spares on Saturday forks.
Rather than being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-fold winner of the cup divided his days between the cheerleader's job and the training, hoping to return to shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for an uneasy Le Golf National field, where improper strikes are severely punished.
And if the field itself is not too gloomy, Miquelson, in the ninth Sunday match, will compete against the exact British Open Course Francesco Mallinary, who, along with Tommy Flitwood, won all four matches this week.
If Americans who lag four points at the beginning of 12 single matches start with successes, Miquelson's match may prove extremely important.
FÃ¼rick expressed confidence in this player, but could no longer say anything.
\"He fully understood his role today, tucked me on my back, drew me in, and said that tomorrow would be ready,\" said FÃ¼rick.
\"He is very sure of himself.
He was admitted to the Hall of Glory and gave very many teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I planned more, but it worked exactly the same way we thought we would play.
He wants to be on the field, too, like everyone else.\"
Miquelson will break Nick Fald's record of the number of matches in the Rider's cup played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in a Rider's cup, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
At Miquelson 18, he won, 20 lost, and seven genders, although FÃ¼rick said his presence had brought benefits to the team.
\"He is funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to fire over people and just a very good man who is good to have on the team,\" he explained.
\"I think the younger players gladly paired his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game.\"
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large gap can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break in front of the individual's last day games on the Rider's cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player debuted in the 1997 match in Valderoma, where the European team, under the leadership of Sevo Balesteras, had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but had finished with a minimum advantage of 141 to 2 to 131 to 2.
\"Perhaps you remind yourself that in Valderam we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost,\" said Bjorn after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 and on Friday, and yesterday, and rowed with a 10-6 on Le Golf National.
\"History shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't the end yet.
You have to play all hundred tomorrow.
Go out into the field and do everything right.
As long as the points didn't appear in the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, that's what we're going to focus on.
I'm constantly saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side are the best players in the world.\"
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf field, Bjorn added, \"I will never pepper itself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow there will be individual games, and this is quite different.
It's just great if you're in the field with your partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing one, you're right here with your true golfist talents.
Here is what you have to bring to the players that they should show the very best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave the partner, the pits need to go and also show the best as an individual player.\"
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim FÃ¼rick, hopes for a better individual game of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
FÃ¼rick himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a \"Cough in Medina.\"
\"I remember every word of this,\" he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain set up his players for the last day.
\"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When speed grows, the greatest pressure turns out to be on those who play games in the middle.
We've made the appropriate layout and put the players in the way we liked.
Thomas has been given the task of starting to play and acting against Rory Macilroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rows, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Jan Poulter will play against the top golfers.
\"I put my players in that order because I think so I will close everything,\" said Bjorn about his choice for individual matches.
The descent of a new German warship is again delayed
Germany's new IMF frigate was to enter the struct in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war war war war war war war ships, but it will not appear before the next year due to unsettling systems and steadily increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The descent of \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", a major ship of absolutely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to enter the rig in 2014, but the problems that emerged after construction interfere with this ambitious project.
The four warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 must replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-ship and zenith rockets, and some \"stels\" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics - longer periods between maintenance - newer fregates may not go into their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant deferrals mean that modern battleships - which may allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country - will become obsolete by the time they finally enter the ranks - mark Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 fell into the headlines last year when the German IMF officially refused to accept the ship and returned his ship's ship's ship Blochm & Voss to Hamburg.
The first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about the many \"deceptions in software and hardware\" that make the ship futile in a battle mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 sailors - half a crew of old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
\"Rheinland-Pfalz\" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to missing equipment, the price of the entire project - including crew teaching - is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - although at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
Problems that accumulate with new frigates are made particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's sea power is decreasing.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in the German Parliament, stated that the IMF \"has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions.\"
He stated that the problem eventually increases because the old ships are speared and the ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were capable of joining the IMF.
The National Memory Management Society overheard the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Mountains aims to discover how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
Scholars hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying dairy and help in future conservation activities for these animals.
A study by scholars of the National Society for the Protection of the Monuments of Scotland deals with small bats and also stormy long-winding bats of Dabanton in Inverius Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located at major locations in that area to monitor bat actions during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records determine the frequency of bat calls as well as which bats do.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, a advisor to the National Nature Conservation Society, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help identify the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals to live.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened with building and developing jobs that affect and destroy habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, also as sticky ribbons for flies and some chemicals for building materials.They are also threatened by domestic cats.
Speakrs aren't blind at all.
However, because of their night-life, bat ears are more receptive than eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex echolocation techniques to exhibit bugs and obstacles in the path of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, site checks and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat announcer in the Trive estate in Damfreys and Galaway, where eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland live.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for bats.
\"Here, in Trive, we have just a great place for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other possessions will help us to understand more about what they need for a better life.\"
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before doing property repairs, as one can unintentionally destroy one sedal, killing up to 400 female and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
Bats are under guard and they are not allowed to kill, scare, trouble or destroy their sedals.
Elizabeth Fairall, a bat maintenance organization employee in Scotland, calls on the public to assist in this matter.
She says, \"We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and about many of the species we don't even know how their populations live.\"
Ranaldu refutes charges of rape, and his lawyers are about to sue the German magazine
Krishna Ranaldou called him accusations of rape by \"fake news,\" saying that people want to \"reclaim themselves,\" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The Ford of Portugal's and Juventus Assembly was charged with rape of the American Catherine Majorgo in the Attel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he was as if he paid her $375,000 for his silence, wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In Instagram's video Live 33-year-old Ranaldou appealed to 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the publication of the charges, calling this message \"fake news\".
\"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are faucet news,\" stated the five-time Gold Ball owner in front of the camera.
\"They want to make advertisements on my name.
It's okay.
They want to make known by recalling my name, but this is part of my work.
I am a happy and kind man,\" he added with a smile.
Justices Ranaldu prepare the case in court against Der Spiegel's magazine on the matter of charges, which called \"an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case,\" reports the Reuters agency.
Christian Schertz's lawyer stated that the player would demand compensation for \"moral damages in a sum consistent with the difficulty of violating rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights.\"
The being had an incident in June 2009 at Palms Howtel and Cassinov's Lux Room in Las Vegas.
Meeting at the Ranaldou and Majorga nightclub, it was as if he had returned to the football player's room, where he had allegedly raped her analally, as written in the Clark County District Court documents in Nevada State.
Majorga claims that after this, Ranaldou has culled and said that on \"99 percent\" he is a \"good guy\" who suffers from \"one percent\".
The papers state that Ranaldu admitted that they had sex, but by consent of the parties.
Majorga also states that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then agreed to a post-trial regulation because she was \"very afraid of revenge\" and her concern that her would \"publicize\".
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to recover the charge because she feels a moral injury for that case.
At a time when it was as if this case of Ranald was going to go to the Madrid Real with the Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian \"Juventus\", closing the 100 million Euro deal.
Brexit: UK \"always harms\" car loss
UK \"always hurt\" when losing its status as world car leader after Brexit, business minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that his \"regardless\" statement by Toyota UK for BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, then the company would temporarily cut production at the plant in Bernaston, nearby Derby in half.
\"We need an agreement,\" said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays on the frontier as a result of Brexito without agreement could lead to a reduction in the work place.
The plant in Bernaston - where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made - last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the EU.
\"In my opinion, when Britain would leave the EU at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,\" said Marvin Cook, Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automobile manufacturers in the UK have raised the issue of how cross-border trade will be done if Britain exits the EU without an agreement. Among them, Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, declares that it will close its Mini plant at Oxford for a month after Brexito.
The main concern is what motorists say about the risk of supply chains resulting in Brexito without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of \"presumably within a period of time\" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and EU for cars that are made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions on the border that will lead to delays and a lack of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to keep more than a day's spare parts in the factory at Derby, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr. Clarke stated that \"The Chackers Plan\" by Theresa May about future relations with the EU \"made exactly so as to avoid these checks on the border.\"
\"We need an agreement.We want to get the best agreement that will allow not only the success of today, but also allow us to use this opportunity,\" he stated in the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
\"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, hints that we should be able to continue the work of successful supply chains.\"
Toyota's company was unable to report how long production would not work, but for the future it warned that the added cost would reduce the factory's competitiveness and result in a reduction in the work place.
Peter Czavalris, who works in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union coordinator, said that union members are very concerned, \"By my leave, if the workplaces are reduced, they will no longer be restored.
The government's president stated, \"We have proposed an accurate plan for our future relationship with the EU that deserves trust.\"
White House declares that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be \"set aside for another week\", while a fight around the candidate for the top court of Brett Cavanaugh stated on Sunday the representative of the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Muller's Special Counsel, who examines interference in election from Russia, the communication of Trump's assistants to Russia, and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
To fire the Trump assistant of the attorney general or not, and thus put at risk Mueller's independence, for months, it burns butter into the fire of yoursngton gossip.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office using 25 amendments.
Rosenstein refuted this.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors of being about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, which was at UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would \"not like\" to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at a hearing at the Senate's legal committee where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacie Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the application against Cavanaugh, which further fueled the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, \"As long as it's not intended, maybe this week, maybe the next.I think it's faster than a week later, taking into consideration all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the newest information.\"
Some journalists are willing to challenge her argument: Sanders did not conduct briefings for the press in the White House from September 10.
The lead program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of the brings was due not to contempt for the television reporters who \"work in public,\" although he added, \"I agree with the fact that they work for the public.\"
Then she said that the Direct Contact of Trump and the Press would increase.
\"The president holds more meetings with answers to press questions than any president that was up to him,\" she said, adding without specific facts, \"We studied these numbers.\"
The brifings happen, reported Sanders, but \"if the press has the chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is far better than doing so through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen how we've done this in the last few weeks, and you can ask a question directly to the President, replace the briefing.\"
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in street meetings, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
Press conferences of the President itself rarely take place.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when freely and sometimes extravagantly appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in the Health System of Scotland before Brexith
The Minister of Health has written to workers with the EU working in the health care system in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to remain after Brexit as well.
Jen Freeman sent the letter less than half an hour before leaving Britain with the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of living bids from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote, \"Let's continue to negotiate between the United Kingdom and the EU about our country's exit. They lead to expected solutions this fall.
But the British government also hastened to prepare for the script without agreement.
I know that for all of you it is a very frustrating time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and not only, provide valuable experiences and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.\"
Christion Abercrombi carried an urgent operation after head injury
Linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercromby has undergone an urgent operation after he received head injury in a Sunday match, which his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Chief Coach Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the injury the player received shortly before the break.
\"He went over to the sideline and suddenly fell,\" said Reed.
Trainers and physicians gave Abercombi oxygen still on the field before putting it on the nasils and carrying it to set up the diagnosis.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombi was pro-operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no \"details about what the injury was\", and Tennessee State will try to detect if the player received the injury.
Abercombi, a secondary sportsman, spends the first season behind Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full intercepts, giving a total of 18 intercepts per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay more duties
According to the new conservative plans, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher shipment, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the licking success of Corbin's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in government duties is reliant on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state shipment, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative to attract young voters, as well as provide affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
Increasing the state shipment is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, but the money they receive will go to the government housing program for the homeless.
Increasing the present state shipment, including higher levels taken two years ago, to purchase second-homes and housing for hire, can make up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to receive up to Â£120 million a year.
Estimated 13 percent of newbies in London are bought by non-recipients of the United Kingdom, this leads to higher prices and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first dwelling.
Many rich regions of the country - especially the capital - have been made \"city-priced\" because a large number of customers from abroad do not live in the United Kingdom for much of the time.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state shipment for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused large construction firms of holding high real estate prices by capturing land and not using it, and urged Mistress May to cancel quotas for affordable housing to direct a \"hunter position with housing\" to Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a loud series of housing reforms, including rent control and the cessation of \"unsubstantiated\" evictions.
He also wants to hand over more authority to local councils in the area of housing construction.
Mistress May said, \"In the past year, I said that the dedication of my work to the office of Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream - life for each new generation must be done better.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not reside in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate is also easy, as are the workers in Britain.
For too many people the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.\"
Jack Ross: \"My main ambition is to manage the Scottish assembly\"
The Sanderland coach, Jack Ross, stated that his main ambition was to ever be done by a coach in Scottish assembly.
A 42-year-old Scottish performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He switched to this work in the summer, after returning St. Myren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
\"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it failed,\" said Ross in transmitting BBC Scottland's Sportsound.
\"I grew up, often sickening for Scotland at Hampshire stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such a possibility will occur if I am a successful club coach.\"
Among Ross's predecessors in Sanderland coach's crew, Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poye, and Paul di Kanya.
Former Aloa Athletic coach says he did not feel afraid of such famous names in such a large club, prior to rejecting offers from Barnes and Ipswich Town.
\"In the meantime, the success for me will be the answer to the question \"can I return this club to Premier League?\"
According to the club's structure and material base his place must be in Primer Lisa,\" he said.
\"Don't just get him back there, but I will only consider my work successful if I can get the club back there.\"
Ross only works as a coach for only three years, until that he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked at the Harts Training Headquarters for 15 months.
Then he helped Aloo return from the third league and turned Saint-Myren out of a loser who almost got to the Champion in the next season's winner.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirku, Saint-Myren, and Hamilton Academic.
By recalling the work in \"Aloo,\" he said, \"It was a really important choice.\"
\"I really believed the coaching job was what I needed, even more than the game.
Sounds incredible because I worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are many things to do every week.
I am now going through this when talking about stress and pressure, but coaching is what needs to be done.
I always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and for me it's the most good time in my adult life.\"

According to the study, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer is 17:30 a.m. on Saturday
The hot summer raised British pubs' profits struggling to survive, but brought pressure on restaurant networks.
According to the pub and bar group statistics, there was a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but in restaurants the sales volume fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting business group that collected this statistics, stated, \"The continued solar weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English assembly in the World Cup Finals, means that in July what happened was also what in June when the pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and here restaurants suffered even more.
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that basically sell drinks as long as they showed the best outcome as opposed to restaurants.
The pubs that sell more food have also been applauded in the sun, although not as strongly as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food fell by three percent.\"
Paul Neumann, an RSM analyst on leisure and placement issues, stated, \"This results from being done by the coach we see from late April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to compete because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and this is very unpleasant when costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer came at the heaviest time for operators who focused on food, and time would show whether the lower temperatures in August would bring such an expected relief.\"
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowing down in brand deployment.
A sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars, and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is an important landmark of this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the social media that it hides from parents
A study showed that every fifth child - some turned out to be only 11 - has secret accounts in the social media that it hides from parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of \"fake Insta\" pages
This news fueled fears that sexual content was being published there
Twenty percent of students said they have a \"basic\" account showing parents
Every fifth child - some only 11 - creates accounts in social media that hold mysteries from parents.
A study of 20,000 middle school students discovered the rapid growth of \"failing Instagram\" accounts --which seems to lead to Instagram's photo sharing site.
This news fueled fears that sexual content was being published there.
Twenty percent of the students were told to lead \"pure\" \"basic\" accounts to show parents, and also lead private accounts.
One mother, who happened to find a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she had urged others to \"rape me.\"
A study conducted by the UK Digital Security and the Independent School Directors' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Chapter HMC Mike Buchanan said, \"It is very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they will not be found by either parents or teachers.\"
Eilid Doyle will be the \"voice of athletes\" in the Scottish Board of Athletics
Eiled Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of athletics as an observational member of the council at the annual general meeting of that body.
Doyle is the most titled athlete in Scotland and Chairman Ian Beaty described this event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to gain many benefits from its experience at a wide variety of levels, including international in the last decade.
\"Eilide enjoys great respect in Scotland, Great Britain, and the world's sporting community, and we are sure that an athletician in Scotland will receive much useful from her work in council,\" Biti said.
Doyle said, \"I want to act as a sportsman's voice and hope to help guide sports in Scotland.\"

I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it was only time to show whether I would be corrected and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I'm fully better off, learned to walk again and now do rest exercises!

Advertising baby pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The baby pump production campaign shared opinions by producing an advertisement that compares nursing women to cows they do.
To mark the launch of what is called the \"first-in-the-world worn baby pump\" consumer campaign Elvie produced an ironic music ad based on video to show the freedom that this device gives to the feeding mother.
The four true mothers dance in the svirana with cows under the song, where there are such words as, \"Yes, I give myself, but I have no tail\" and \"On occasion, if you didn't notice, it's not a wash, it's my chest.\"
And the pretence was, \"Dai, dai, I feed the children, dai, dai, I give my women.\"
However, the advertisement that was posted on the company's Facebook page caused a hot discussion on the internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.The video response was ambiguous, many said it was the horror of small production.
\"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, here is only their children taking away after a few days,\" one viewer wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is undetectably hidden in the feeder's bustle (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment is, \"It is understood to be traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a baby pump for mothers who don't take away children?\"
Someone added, \"So thoughtless an advertisement.\"
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song \"requested\".
\"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd like to have one if I had breast feeding.
Sucking the milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's an ad that's a little crazy, but I like it.
It's a genius product,\" she wrote.
Another comment is, \"A very fun ad aimed at mothers sucking off milk with a pump (often in a workplace or in a toilet) and hearing themselves \"carry.\"
It is an advertisement that neither approves nor condemns the milk industry.\"
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with invisible baby pumps hidden in bustlers.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use baby pumps feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump pump is fully soundless, has no rights, no tubes, and is imperceptibly hidden in bustlers for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children, and even exits home while working the device.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creation director of Mother's Company, remarked, \"Elvie Pump is so revolutionary a product that it deserves a clear and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between nursing women and baby cows we wanted to pay attention to sucking milk and its difficulty while demonstrating in a fun and good way how a new baby pump would bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's baby pump gets into the focus of attention.
During the London Week fashion, the mother of two children appeared on a podium in clothes from Martha Jacobowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children with no excess noise are moved to a hint camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings has almost changed in the month, there has been a sharp rise in the number of detained migrant children, partly the reason for this being served by the harsh rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump Administration that have impeded the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are wary of putting their own stay in the country at risk by taking responsibility for the child.
Risks increased considerably in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other full-time household members would need to file fingerprints and data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking staff member of the Immigration and Customs Service, spoke before Congress with a report of the arrest to the agency of dozens of people who had requested to sponsor minors without escort.
Later in the agency, it was reported that 70% of those arrested had no trial before.
\"About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and much of them are foreigners with the criminal past.
Therefore we continue to persecute such people,\" said Mr. Olbens.
For faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with, according to shelter workers, a previously standard term of 60 days.
A large number of people will have to use video communication to file an application for their own legal status to an immigration judge, rather than attending court in person.
Those who are treated without any reason to provide assistance are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged over the past few months, the longer children remain in prison, the higher the likelihood of depression occurring or increasing frustration, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts.
Lawyers state that in larger institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much stronger, as the signs that the child is in hot condition are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to a hint town without providing time for emotional preparation or to cheer up with friends may make it worse to have an injury that many have already faced.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the \"occupancy forces\" of the United States, France and Turkey
In addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualm also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the war continuing in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are on Syrian land illegally, on the basis of fighting terrorism, and \"of them will be dealt with accordingly.\"
\"They must leave immediately and not set any conditions,\" he said at a Assembly meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where over 360,000 people had died since 2011, and millions of people had had to quit their homes, \"the war on terrorism is practically over.\"
He reported that Damascus intends to continue \"to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories\" from both terrorist groups and \"any illegal foreign presence.\"
Syria has about 2,000 U.S. troops who are mainly acting as instructors and advisors to the Kurds forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar Assad.
France's land contingent in this war-broken country is over 1,000 troops.
On the question of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions for return were favourable and accused \"some western countries\" of \"the spread of irrational fears\" that kept refugees abroad.
\"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,\" he says.
\"They politicize an exclusively humanitarian question.\"
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in recovering until a political agreement to end the war is reached between Assad and opposition.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major resistance of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented the large-scale offensive of Syrian forces supported by Russia to a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem emphasized that the agreement had \"exact terms\", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-related front of Nusr, who would \"be destroyed\".
A UN messenger, Stafan de Mistura, hopes to call the first sittings of a new committee to include representatives of the government and opposition to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to \"revision of articles of the active constitution\", and an obstacle from interference.
Why Trump will go for a second term
By this logic, Mr Trump wins the 2020 election when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will not complete his presidency indefinitely.
And it will no doubt be \"The dramatic finality of the presidency for all history!\"
There is no sign of audience fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown by more than twice - to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times - to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" channel MSNBC assembled at the screen with 3.5 million viewers and crossed cable television ratings in the evenings when the main news was broadcast.
\"This is the fire to which people are dragged, because we don't understand it,\" says Neil Ber, director of ABC's \"Victory\" drama about a Cabinet Minister member who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
There is another theory in Nellie Scowell, a masterist of comedies and authors of the book \"A couple of funny details and a few hard truths about insight into Hollywood boys' club,\".
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr Trump.
- Why? - she asked.
He answered, \"Because he cheers me,\" said Miss Scowell to me.
Chaos is also valuable in that it can amuse.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the story lines coming out of Washington can become as definite a future as the Row v. Wade case, it depends on whether or not immigrant families will be able to come together and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch for the sixth hour as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of \"information not to print\" in the Fear book, Paul's jacket of Manafort's 15,000 dollars with dishwashing skin (a clothes bearing pride as written in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the sharp descriptions by Storm Daniels, gm, Mr Trump's anatomy, this goes out for a simple framework of wanting to be aware of affairs.
I will never look at Super Mario for instance just like I used to.
\"The part of what he does makes you feel as if you are watching the reality show he demonstrates every evening,\" says Brant Montgomery, executive director of \"Wheelhouse Entertainment\" and creator of \"Pawn Stars\" (Stars as pawns) about the changing acting composition of Trump's show and the constant turns of the story (\"sparing\" with the NFL, Kim Chen Ein's approval).
You can't afford to skip even one episode, otherwise you'll get away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleas this week, behind the windows of his house on the northern bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he wrote off CNN.
He could not fail, not when Brett Cavanaugh rebelled before the Senate Judicial Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a hairsail.
\"I remember the girls when we produced these crazy shows, and the people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization',\" said Mr. Flace to me.

External cash flows are poured into a rigid pre-election race of intermediate elections to the House of Representatives
It is surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district covered the money in the Gulf thanks to a change in the district boundaries made by Congress, causing the two candidates to participate in the election in one place.
The recently repainted suburban district of Pizzburg is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the Conar Lamb House of Representatives, who won his seat in another district at the pre-elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another acting MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The pre-existing race in the new 17th district caused a decline in funding for the company by major party financial groups, the Democratic Company Congress Committee (CCDC) and the National Republican Company Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory at the widely enlightened pre-elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been a Republican for over ten years now, and President Donald Trump has won a 20 point break in the district.
Political experts find a small advantage to Democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China and then retreated
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position despite slight opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and settled at a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in connection with \"the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan\", stated the press secretary to the State Department of Heather Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug turnover control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and target restrictions on the issuance of visas, would be painful to the country of Central America with its high levels of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings were completed, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a conference at a high level devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would become a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was staged as a step in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration representatives had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension is now speaking out at a conference scheduled for mid-October, in order that the administration is in favour of hosting the event.
And the three American messengers returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new cruel messengers or punishments from Washington.
A White House representative, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while maintaining anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration by an analyst who also wished to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step may be to report to special attorney Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice to Mr Trump, examples of which currently have very heavy evidence in public nature documents.
Mr. Mueller is reported to have drawn attention in the investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy by Trump and Russia in an attack on the election.
When Congress will change the landlord, Mr Trump will find himself before face-to-face responsibility to this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the electors, and perhaps eventually to the jury from the number of his colleagues.
There is much \"if\", and I don't want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, just like he's like it is in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to state coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and have missed the opportunity to avoid the next few years of bloodshed.
History revolves around similar turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Directly, Americans now faced several of these turning points.
What will happen if Mr Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult position ever since he wrote in the paper about what he had suggested last year secretly writing the president's words and thinking about his profability.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the \"The Times\" treat is inaccurate.
\"How will we react if a recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavan is not comprehensive or fair, or if he is approved in the Supreme Court, despite worthy of the trust of the charges of sex rape and dishonest indications?
And above all, will we vote in elections for Congress, which will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it will take a long winter for democracy.
But I do believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slavic Hebrew who was deported to Aspencius by the very Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this desk with a swastika.
With such a legacy as I may not be optimistic about our future?\"

Graham Dorans of Rangers optimistically tuned the day before the Rapid Wen match
Rangers take \"Rapid Vienna\" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after impressive nothing in Spain over \"William\" at the beginning of this month will allow them to safely get out of Group G of the League of Europe.
The injury to the knee prevented Graham Dorance's semi-protector to speak out in season to nothing 2-2 with Villareal, however, he believes that Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as trumps.
\"It was a substantial match for us, because \"William\" is a strong rival,\" reasoned 31-year-old football player.
\"We started the game thinking we could get something, and earned a point.
Perhaps at the end we could kill the ball, but overall nothing also became a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves into our hands, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday there will be another significant one for European football night.
I hope we will be able to earn three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they have shown a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of solicitors on the stands, I am sure we will be able to solve them and show them a good game.
The minor year was determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy playing; the training is productive.
I hope we will be able to move forward, cross the result of the past season, and succeed.\"
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement accumulations
Despite the fact that the survey participants had an accurate idea of what care they wanted for themselves, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in a nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
\"People want a member of the family to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss this,\" says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationguide for Life Insurance.
That's what you should start with.
Think this out with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not announce your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and family and talk about where and how to get medical care as this choice can become an important factor in determining cost.
Involve a financial consultant to discuss.it can also help find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or you may be able to self-insurance your life - provided you have the money.
Decide legal documents cases: foresaw judicial battles.
Get confidence in medical care to appoint a trusted person to control your medical care and ensure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can't talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing trust in financial management.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are inactive.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your aged father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about prohibited medications and the presence of allergies?
Record these details in writing to be ready.
\"They have a role not only to financial issues but also to the professionalism of doctors\" adds Martin.
\"What medications are required?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to schedule everything.\"
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man got a couple of droppings from the pneumatic rifle when he walked home at night.
The victim for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove district in Ilfracombe, County Devon when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and hand.
Police officers described the shooting that took place at approximately 02:30 local time, as \"a random event\".
The victims did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, the police ask the witness to contact them.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that collapsed on the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection of communications, the humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal regency, an area north of Palo that is closer to the earthquake epicenter by a power of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a stun disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palo and Donghal on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding.
Dongala is a regency extending along over 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency is an administrative unit of status below the province, there were 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the province's Central Sulawesi economy, especially the coastal Dongal region.
Nickel mining is also important to the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Reducing the Consequences of Stunning Disasters, Palu and Donggal have been hit several times in the past 100 years by tsunamis.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed in Dongal by the tsunami, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
Also, the tsunami hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and its regular rock earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that abated 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in the Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes swung onto the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred in the south of Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that burred the southern coast, resulting in the death of about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-point earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people have died.
2010: a 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentava Islands outside of Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016:A weak earthquake awoke to the Podia Jai regency in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami came this time, but more than 100 people died under ruins of buildings.
2018: strong earthquakes swung on the tourist island of Lambock Indonesia, resulting in over 500 deaths, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without the opportunity to leave.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Trek Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice candidate for president Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Paylin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted information about domestic violence and resistance to arrest published on Saturday by Alaska State police.
According to a police report, when one acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the \"KTUU\" channel, Paylin is in the Matanusco-Sussitna investigation insulator under a $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself \"presumably innocent\" when he was asked if he recognized the guilt, reported the network.
Paylin is charged with three A class offences, for which he is threatened with imprisonment for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with committing a class B offence punishable by imprisonment for the day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges were exhibited against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, summoned the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is currently at the disposal of the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a family rape report, and possession of a weapon in a state of alcohol intoxication due to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sarah Paylin has been criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for associating her son's severe behavior with the posttraumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on Sulawesi's Indonesian island on Friday.
A 7.5-point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work, and it is expected that the number of victims will grow in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact spread on social networks.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami abated ashore.
Federal prosecution requires rarely a death sentence for a suspected New York terrorist attack
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York is seeking death penalty for Sayful Saypav, suspected of a New York attack that resulted in eight deaths - a rare penalty that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, in October, allegedly took advantage of a truck truck by Home Depot to ride a bike track along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to ground the death sentence, according to the intent to achieve the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Sayipov \"intentionally\" beat eight people and \"intentionally\" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court's materials, for both offences a possible measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty is available.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigation jury, Shalamila Sayipov, filed an indictment of 22 points, which included eight charges of murder to support the recet; this point is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of rape and destruction of vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required \"steward and deliberate planning\" and by describing the crimes committed by the Soip, they used phrases such as \"disgusting, cruel, and depraved\".
\"Saifula Habibulawayicz Saipov caused injuries, caused damage, and brought losses to families and friends of Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lory Decadet, Darena Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernana Ferucha, Hernan Diego Mendasa, and Alejandra Damian Pagnuka,\" are told in a message of intent.
The five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last start of the criminal case with a measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty in South New York County.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York City in the federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs, a married couple who were punished after they had been sentenced two years earlier for conspiracy for the purpose of spying in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Rosenbergs' pair were punished on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an outlaw from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated that there were no qualms of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he stated to investigators that he felt pleased with his act.
According to the indictment, Sayipov informed the authorities that he had been inspired to watch a video of the Islamic State on the phone at the attack.
He also asked permission to hang out the Islamic State flag in the hospital room, reported to the police.
He does not find himself guilty of an indictment conclusion consisting of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Soipov, said that they were \"immediately disappointed\" by the prosecution's decision.
\"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than the life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only lengthen the pain from these events for all participants,\" said Patan.
The Saipov Defence Team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of Parliament from the Torah says that Nigel Faraj should designate negotiations on Brexith.
Today during the protest at the Tori Party Conference, Nigel Faraj vowed to \"mobilize the people's army\".
Former UK leader Ukip said politicians should \"feel discomfort\" from Euroskeptics - as one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, offered his candidacy to negotiate with the EU.
Member of Parliament from the conservative party Peter Bown said during the March in Birmingham that Great Britain would already \"exceed\" if Mr. Farage had served as secretary for Brexith.
But the problem that Mistress May faced in trying to reconcile her disparate supporters was still worsened when the Tories, who advocate for maintaining EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexith in the city.
The Premier, of all strength, tries to keep the compromised Chamberer Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and associates of the exit as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist on over the course of their attempts to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force the Euroskeptics and Labourists to choose between her package and her \"bride\".
Mr. Boun said at a rally in Salihall, \"The Rise of Walking\" (Leave Means Leave), that he wants to \"throw the Cheker off the board.\"
He proposed that Mr. Farajad be made equal and laid off the responsibilities for negotiating with Brussels.
\"If he were responsible, we would have already gone out,\" he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingbor added, \"I am for Brexith, but we need to move away from the Cheker Plan.\"
Speaking against the EU, he said, \"We have not fought world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country.\"
Mr Boun rejected the assumptions that public opinion changed after the 2016 vote, \"The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely out of reality.\"
Brexito's supporter and a member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in conversation with journalists she said, \"I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
\"The Cheker Plan is unpopular among the general public; opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out into the streets and pick us up.
Please give up the plan and start listening.\"
In a sharp address to Mrs. May, she added, \"Prime ministers remain in office when they fulfill their promises.\"
Mr Faraj said that politicians need to be forced to \"feel discomfort\" when they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
\"It is now a question of trust between us - nations and politicians,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexitus, and we're here today to tell them, 'It won't get you out of your hand'\"
In his address to the captured crowd he added, \"I want you to force those politicians who are willing to betray Brexith to feel discomfort.
\"We mobilize the people's army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexita, and will never be reassured until we become independent, self-directed, proud of the United Kingdom.\"
Meanwhile, co-workers came out through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists swinged the Tories Against Brexit banners (Tores v. Brexit) after starting the group on these weekends.
Leybaristic pen Lord Adanis made a deal over the conservatives on the occasion of the security problems they faced due to the programme for the party at the opening of the conference.
\"These are the people who tell us that they can have ready to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for a border without friction, for free trade without boundaries in Ireland,\" he added.
\"It is a full farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexith.' he added.
Warren plans to pay careful attention to the process of chatting for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will \"take careful note of the process of chatting for the presidency.\"
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told his future during a general gathering in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go to re-election; she is opposed by a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dill, who was the co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of discussions as a possible Trump rival in 2020.
Since Trump's entry into office, this was already the 36th meeting with voters in the general assembly format that took place Saturday afternoon in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to bolt to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for \"a woman to go to Washington to correct a broken government, and for that, a woman must stand at the head.\"
Arist happened after the death of Basketballist Sims of the Louisiana University team
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect suspected of killing a basketball player, U.S.L. Weida Sims, had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Authority announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dyton Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m. on the east.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shooting asking for help to identify the person who was depicted on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning of Friday near the South University campus.
\"Wade Sims received a fire wound in his head resulting in his death,\" said a \"247sports channel journalist\" chief of police Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of questioning, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist at the arrest and was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County police office.
The sport-junior growing 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) growing in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games, of which 10 were on course from the beginning, average spent 17.4 minutes on the course, cast 5.6 points, and made 2.9 picks for the game.
Gran at Russia: Lewis Hamilton drew near the title Champion of the world after, by an in-command arrangement, he won a victory over Sebastian Fetell
From the moment that Walter Botas was on Saturday ahead of him at Lewis Hamilton's qualifying meeting, it became clear that the instructions within the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good place on the razor and almost left Hamilton at will of fortune while he defended his place on the first two faiths and invited Fettel to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton bobbling at the end of the general mass of racers, it was this maneuver that was supposed to become crucial.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit stop on a circle later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came forward after several wheel-in-the-wheel maneuvers that made the driver \"Ferrari\" leave the inside space free, risking keeping up after double maneuvering to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferrstapen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the net and by the end of the first round he was in the seventh place.
He then lead most of the race while holding his tires because he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Reikanen and take the fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit stop on the 44th circle, but was unable to increase speed on the remaining eight circles, so Rikanan took the fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtery all weekend spoke fantastically and expressed himself to a real gentleman if I were allowed to speak that way.
\"The team did an outstanding job to take the first and second place,\" Hamilton commented.
It was a truly bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak letter Christina Blacey Ford, in which she charged the candidate for the Brett Cavanite Supreme Court with sex violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the indications given by Ford before the Judicial Committee of the Senate, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be \"slow, abominable, and untrue.\"
\"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger when you see the wicked, the bruising, and the lying people,\" he said.
\"When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'\"
It's not me.\"
Do you remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your leak?
Remember her answer...you lost the document - \"Oh, oh, what?\"
No, no.
There was nothing from me.\"
Wait a minute.
We let the escape...No, we didn't,\" he added, parading the senator.
Finestein, in July, sent a letter with a detailed teaching of the charges put forward by Ford against Cavan, and he escaped in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
\"I did not hide the charges of Dr Ford, I did not allow the escape of her story,\" Finstein told the committee, reporting \"The Hill.\"
\"She asked the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request.\"
But her denial probably didn't like the president who so commented on it during the Saturday rally, \"That's what I'll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen\"
Continuing to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sex harassment by three women, the President suggested that Democrats use accusations for their own purposes.
\"They are full of determination to regain power by any means.
You see the underworld, the merzote, and they don't care whom they wound, through whom they'll have to renegotiate to gain power and control,\" is conveying the words of President \"Mediaite.\"
Elite League: Dundy Stars - Belfast Jayants 5-3
Patrick Douier killed two shajs for Jayants in a match against Dundi
Dundi Stars played for the Friday defeat they had suffered by Belfast Jayants as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 back match in the Saturday home match.
Thanks to the strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville Jayants, they were lead on two highways at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the number before Duyer restored Jayants' leadership.
FranÃ§ois Bouchar of Dundee leveled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nilsen two galles secured the victory team.
This became the third parasite in the Elite League for the season for the Adam Kif team, which won Dundee with a number 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
Teams met for the fourth time per season; Jayants won the previous three matches.
The first goal at the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed Duoyer from Kendall McFola's filing, and another four minutes later, Baville doubled the number after David Rutherford filed.
In a lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened a number on the side of the masters of the field and then Cawn leveled the number after Matt Markwardt's transmission (15:16).
Douier secured Jayants leadership when leaving for the first break, killing his second sham for meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the account, killing the highway at a numerical advantage of the team (27:37).
Coun and Charles Karkaroff helped Nilsen lead Dundee in the leader for the first time over the match at the end of the second period, and he secured victory along with the fifth team number in the middle of the last period.
Jayants who have already lost four of the last five meetings will play the last game at the homeground against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic transporter die, saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An aircraft dispatcher in Indonesia a hero has died, ensuring a successful take-off of an airplane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which triggered the tsunami.
Strong underground jolts are still ongoing, and many people are buried under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were rescued by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a dispatching tower that was swam wildly in the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the 6321 Batik Air Company, which was on the takeoff lane at that point, was outstretched from the ground.
He then jumped out of the dispatcher out when he decided that it would break up.
He later died in a hospital.
According to ABC News Australian program, according to Air Navigation Indonesia's representative Johanes Sirait, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Bolicpapan on Kalimantan, which was to carry it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Paul.
\"Our hearts are broken,\" he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are wary that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and the agency for reducing the dangers of tedious disasters states that access in the city of Dongal, Sigga and Button is limited.
A representative of the Sutop Purva Nugroho agency reported, \"Perhaps the number of victims will still increase, as many bodies still have not been able to dig from under debris.\"
Waves reaching up to six metres devastated Pala, where mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft double humanitarian aid.
The rice Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, reported \"Sky News\": \"Every minute the car--quick--brought bodies.
There is not enough clean water.
Everywhere shoplifters do.\"
Jan Hellfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported \"CNN\": \"The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who have survived, but we do not know what is waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but everything can become much worse.\"
The president of Indonesia, Jok Wido, arrived in Pala on Sunday and said to the military, \"I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?\" reports \"CNN\".
Earlier this year, earthquakes in Lambok already affected Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: by \"Air Niugini\" one person was missing without news after the plane was broken in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team had safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking and now claimed to disappear without the news of one passenger.
Air Niugini Company stated in a press release that as of Saturday day she could not report the location of one male passenger.
The airline reported that she was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; for example, its age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the remaining passengers and the team after landing the plane on water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had fallen into the hospital.
The airline reported six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday; they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash as well as the exact sequence of events remain unexplained.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon without flying to the landing lane.
According to some witnesses, the plane jumped through the landing lane.
According to American passenger Bill Jains, the plane flew very low.
\"It's very successful,\" Jannes reported.
According to him, he and others were able to get through the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane that had already melted.
He said that the boatmen panicked and began shouting as well as that he had received a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who rammed nearby the harbor also helped in the rescue by taking advantage of an on-board boat to transport people to shore until the aircraft sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst resumes the course of events on the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge concluded by presenting evidence in a review of the case of a man who is charged with being burned by a resident of the Mississippi State in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave indications for several hours as an engaging expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the records from his cell phones to recover the movements of Quinton Tellis, a 29-year-old respondent, and Jessica Chambers, a 19-year-old victim, on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlett, he received information about the place from several cell phones which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his past statements.
When it was data that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone at the time, he was said to have been with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were headed to ask Sanford.
Sanford gave indications on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the side of the charge asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that Sanford was that evening in the van, he stated that he was \"false, since my van was in Nashville.\"
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records from cell phones showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Rowlett, sometime after Chambers Tellis died, she removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
\"He rubbed her out of his life,\" said Hayley.
The bok of the defence must begin the parties' disputes on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be submitted to the jury's consideration later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling its music with positive facilities.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, declares that hip hop has distanced itself from its leaks: political statements and acute issues.
They want to return to its roots and again make conscious hip-hop popular.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have returned to collectives such as The Fugues and Common, a popularity in the UK.
Another black man?!
The babysitter from New York falls to court on a married couple for a \"racist\" message after the dismissal
The babysitter from New York falls to court on a married couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she is \"another black\".
The couple deny that they are racists, aligning the poses to \"exploration\".
In 2016, Lindsay Place-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment by discovering that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was blacksmith when she arrived on her first working day.
\"NEAYEEEY, YESCHED ONE CHARNASKURAY,\" wrote Mrs. Place-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent Miss Morris' message twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing the mistake, \"feeled awkward\" Plasca-Flaxman fired Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also African-American, had been ill-treated, and that she had waited instead for her Filipino.
Miss Morris paid for the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris falls on a couple to the court and wants to receive compensation for dismissal in accordance with the conditions on which she was initially hired, though without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residence.
\"I want to show them what can't be done that way,\" she reported \"Post\" on Friday. \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
\"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist,\" said \"Post\" husband, Joel Plask.
\"And would you trust your children to him who has been treated rudely, let even by chance?
Your baby?
Really?\"
The placard likens the poses to \"extortion\" and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a \"very difficult situation\".
\"And will you become persecuted by the man in that position?
That's pretty hard,\" added an investment-banking specialist.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the marriage couple on social networks, subjecting sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not superlive the bear talking, said in a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter, \"The burden of putting herself in the place of the One who reads it for the first time before it is published.
So curious is it to read, already knowing of Paddington's immense success.\"
She told us that her father, who had worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was \"hot-sweet\" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as \"a very important member of our family.\"
\"He was a rather quiet man, and not bragging at all,\" she told.
\"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's pride for a child who had something done: you're proud of them, though it's not really your merit.
I think he was considering Paddington's success in that key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave proper to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter died, and I had to get to know her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was delivered to Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
\"Beyond regularly called to tell her that everything was really bad that she would not endure,\" said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
\"Then I was called over to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to part with her.
And I did it.
I said, \"Tash, I love you so much, dear.
I'll soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave to beat her heart slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the very end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was unfolding there.
I could neither groan nor shout nor weep, for there were families and people around me.
I needed to hold on to--\"
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, sat in the plane with the other passengers -- and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
\"No one knew,\" she said.
\"I leaned my head and face flowed tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's in flight that I've been gripped by Ned's sense of compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her.\"
Women who grieve hang out cards to warn suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do everything to keep other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out cards on with warm words and phone numbers by which people can get help, on bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began his depression and in 18 he committed suicide.
\"I don't want other parents to feel as I feel,\" she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a talented shef-parr with a contagious smile.
\"Every man knew his smile.
People were saying that his smile would light any room.\"
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was \"in a very dark place.\"
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, \"I constantly worry that there may be unpleasant consequences to this.\"
Mrs. Davis created cards, \"to have people know that there are persons in the world you can address and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you need to talk.\"
Mrs. Hasfreys, who has been friends for many years with Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner, with whom he lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
\"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was in depression, or something like that,\" she said.
\"In the days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday day he was very depressed: when the children opened the presents, he did not even look at them.\"
She said that his death was a great injury to them, but had to live with it, \"A huge hole appeared in the family.
It just kills us.
But you must continue to live and fight.\"

Breta Cavanaugh's future is uncertain because the FBI begins an investigation
\"I thought that we might have what he wants - limited in time and in the coverage of the investigation - we can get a little connection,\" said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was troubled that the committee was \"disgusting\" because he actually got into probation.
Why would Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to check the investigation?
Their reluctance is explained at times.
Intermediate elections in just five weeks, on November 6th - if Republicans are expected to suffer a parasite then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect to the supreme court the candidate they need.
George Bush called senators to pro-labour the support of Mr. Kavano, who worked at the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is not until it is understood whether Mr. Kawano will receive at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Penns to solve the problem of voting equality and approve him to the Supreme Court.
The number of runners from North Korea dropped in the Kima leadership
The number of runners from North Korea to South Korea dropped from the time Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Pak Bo Sun, bringing data from the South Korea Ministry of Joint, stated that last year there were 1127 runners, and 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons are the enhanced border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers have set for resale.
Phenian did not comment on this in any way.
Most runners from the north over why South Korea's citizenship is obtained.
Seoul claims that over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea has the longest limit; it is more simply to go over than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very much guarded.
China sees runners as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South -- which is technically still in a state of war -- has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian to negotiate concerning denucleorization.
This took place after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in June in Singapore when they agreed in general terms to work with the goal of fully freeing the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yan Ho, charged American sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
\"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we are not going to disarm first,\" said Mr. Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelozie called Bretta Cavano a \"isteric\", she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Nancy Pelozi's House of Representatives named the candidate for the Bretta Cavano Supreme Court \"isteric\" and stated that at his temperament he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelozy said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune issue festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if so were the conduct of a woman, she would be called a `isterka'\" led Pelozie about his reaction to Cavanaugh's speech before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally refuted accusations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even yelled and could not speak when his family and older classes of school were discussed.
He also clearly accused Democrats of the committee, naming accusations against him as a \"gratesque and organized murder of a person\" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost his 2016 presidential election.
Pelozie stated that she believed that Cavanaugh's performance showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against the Democrats.
\"I believe that he himself disqualified by his statements and by the manner in which he spoke of Clinton and the Democrats,\" she said.
Pelozie objected when she was asked if she would try the impeachment Cavanaugh if he was elected and if Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I will say so--if he does not say the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he not only must not work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,\" said Pelozy.
At the moment, Kawano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia.
Peloci added that as a member of a democratic party, she was troubled by the potential decisions of Cavanaugh against the law of available medicine or in Rowe v. Wade's case, because Cavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing of the approval at the Cavanaugh Court, he did not answer questions as to whether he would cancel certain Supreme Court decisions.
\"Now it's not the time for hysterical, unbiased persons to work in court and wait for words from us--how wonderful--\" stated Pelozy.
And the woman should be able to do it.
It is an excused accusing speech, months, and years of anger simply overtook, and she cannot recall it without tears.
\"We cry when we are angry,\" 45 years ago said to me, Mrs. Steiny.
\"I don't think it's that rare.\"
She went on, \"I really helped a woman who was working principals somewhere, and who was saying that when she was angry, she was crying, but she was producing a technique of behavior. When she was angry and started to cry, she said to the co-conspirators, \"Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am angry.\"
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great.\"
Tears are allowed in part as an output of the sum because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from the first work, at which I once cried from the involuntary malice, then behind my collar seized an elderly woman-- a restrained boss who had always scared me a little--and dragged me to the meetings.
\"Never allow you to be seen in tears,\" she said.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think thee sad and will be glad that they have brought thee.\"
Patricia Schroedar, at the time a congressman Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in a presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt fell on a marriage adultery at a yacht called Monkey Business and came out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroedar thought that she and herself could be a part of the presidential campaign.
\"It wasn't a very well thought out solution,\" laughing she told me 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates, and I was not needed at all.
Someone called this situation \"The Whitefly and the Seven Dwarfs.\"
Since the company had been going for quite some time, she lacked the funds, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election unless she took away $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters who sacrificed $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
\"They think I'm going with the dump?\" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so deeply gripped by the emotions--thanks to the people who supported her, the malice on the system that made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters, not candidates, and anger at sexism--that she had intercepted her breath.
\"You might think that I have a nervous breakdown,\" recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to her condition.
\"I could think that my corporate sponsor was the producer of Kleenex paper surveets.
Once upon a time I thought, what would they write on my tombstone?
âShe wept â\"
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first halls of trade war between China and the United States were aggregating, and since the war is far from over, in the more distant perspective misunderstandings between countries may be in favor of Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning at the beginning of this year, laying siege to China's major export goods including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected goods for a total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods that fall into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in this way, raising recently tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods at a cost of $60 billion.
China has pledged the United States a symmetrical answer, and the second largest economy is hardly an eye to lead.
To force Washington to retreat, one must delve deeper into demand, but a public inclination before the United States is virtually unacceptable to the Chinese leader Si Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing correctly uses the situation, the U.S. trade war pressure in the far run can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
\"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing may create conditions that will begin the process of sharp economic fall is far more dangerous than observers thought earlier,\" stated Abigail Grace, assistant researcher specializing in Asia, at the research-analytic center for new American security.
Syria is \"hot\" until refugees return, says Foreign Minister
Syria declares that it is ready to return refugees and calls for assistance to rebuild a country devastated by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualm stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
\"The situation in the country is more stable and safe today, thanks to progress in combating terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
We now have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
UN believes that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million who live in the country require humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualm stated that the Syrian regime would gladly take aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he emphasized that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that had sponsored mutinies.
Europe won the Rydar Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rydar Cup, winning an American team with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburb of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost the sixth time in a row on European land and has not won the Rydar cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown even when the Danish captain team, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points necessary to win over the United States.
The American star, Phil Miquelson, who was most struggling with the tournament, drove his ball into the water on the 3rd pair of 16th Holes, yielding this match to Francesco Mallinari.
The Italian Galfist Malinary played perfectly on all rounds, being made one of the four players who passed this field with a number of 5.0-0 from the beginning of the tunir in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with a number of 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's most toasted player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in his last Rydar cup.
The veteran eight cups of Rydar the Spanish, Sergio Garcia, was a player who has over all won a 25.5 point career tournament.
\"I usually don't cry, but I can't hold back today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
The whole thing is on the team, and I'm glad I could help,\" said the disturbed Garcia after winning the European team.
He passed the estaphet to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday played the legend of the American Tiger Woods golf in the single 2&1 match.
\"I am very proud of having won the Tiger Woods, a man whose career had been followed since childhood,\" said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all his four mothers in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Rydar cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is lagging behind on this score only from Jack Niclales.
The American team fought themselves with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tney Finns, who played throughout the tournament of high-class golf.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointed defense game to his team, \"I'm proud of these guys, they're bikes.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we were capable of.
We fought.
Let's take off our hat in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our committee cup Rydar, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been re-played.\"
