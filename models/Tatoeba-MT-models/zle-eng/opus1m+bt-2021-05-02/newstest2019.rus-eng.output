Number of recruits ready to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People ' s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhan People ' s Republic (LNR) said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.
He said that it's how Kiev plans to do something about the units.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to take up service in the Ukrainian LC, mass dismissals have resulted in low units,” said Marocko, quoted by RIA News:
He also did not exclude that the real numbers of Ukrainians assigned to the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a Joint Forces (SEO).
The measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian militants in dealing with the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was exacerbated by the murder of Alexander Zaharchenko, head of the DNR.
The DNR authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were arrested during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that Ukrainian security forces had organized a diversion.
The U.S. authorities forced Mask to resign from the presidency of the Tesla government
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave the post of chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tesla company, upon request from the US authorities.
The Federal Securities and Business Exchange Commission will also pay $20 million to settle claims to the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the department allows Muska to remain in the leading position in Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the post of President of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clear that the agreement is yet to be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of having sufficient funds to buy the shares of the company and had filed a statement with the entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy out Tesla's shares at $420 apiece, but he never did.
After tweeting, the company grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MID compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
The British Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of spitting into the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt has thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not decline, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had stalled.
Thus, she commented on the outcome of the European Union informal summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
Moreover, the question on the Irish border remains open.

The head of the village of Altai stopped hunger strike for the benefit of the inhabitants
The MP reported on its Facebook page that it had stopped starving for several reasons.
The Head of Agriculture stated that the situation had stalled, and his demands were not met by the district administration, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office initiated a review of the situation, and the heat supply organization STPC promised to start preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
The villagers also made and removed a massive collective appeal to the Governor of the Altay region — a catastrophic situation —
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal, his responsibilities as head of the hunger strike were fully carried out.
As Boronin explained, the Siberian and Rogulic villages have centralized heating systems and thus the authorities in charge of preparing them for winter are required to administer the First-May Area administration.
However, no one has ever started these activities.
The Head of Agriculture also protested the lack of adequate control and support from the Government of the Altay region and against the financial policy of Gazprominterregionas Novosibirsk-
In addition to the proper training for winter settlements, Boronin required - immediately to organize a full, autonomous area of utilities with the relevant units -
Namely, Moscow has the cheapest apartments.
In the first half of 2018, Moscow has purchased about 3,000 housing units ranging from 30 square metres to up to four million roubles.
More than half of these transactions were conducted by two JCs, testifying to the contents of the Urbanus portal.
Up to four million roubles in the budget were the leaders of the JK - Nekrasovka, located outside ICAD, in the Kottelniki district (UWAO), and the Barbaris compound in the Bibibrevo district (SWAO).
Two JCs in New Moscow - Southern Bunino - and Maple Alleys - are also visible in the structure of budget housing transactions.
Urbanus analysts point out that the share of apartment transactions of up to four million rubles in these projects is up to 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of total revenue.
The impact of apartments with less than four million roubles on the commercial success of the micronation - Central - in the New Watutinks - and JK - Philats Lug - is recognized, says a study on two New Moscow JCs.
They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.
Previously, the ranking of the areas of Moscow with the cheapest apartments in the new buildings was presented at the real estate agency - Bon Ton-
According to the company, the lowest prices of primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per meter) were recorded in UWAO in September 2018.

Telegram users complained of a failure in the new version
The iPhone users complained about the problems of the Telegram Messenger following the update on 28 September.
The number of the user's phone can be found in the user's validity
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after updating, the annex displays a white screen or closes immediately.
The Messrs' representatives responded to the crash.
They said that the problem might be related to the migration of information to a new app written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended automatic updating of the application until the malfunctions were corrected.
On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block the Telegram Messrs.
Three days later, communication operators proceeded to comply with the decision.
The reason was that the messenger's administration refused to provide the FSB with the keys to decode the correspondence necessary to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to reveal the IP address and the identity of the terrorist suspect's mobile phone when a court order was issued.
Telegram audit fell by 1.2 million after the lock-in of the RF.

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
CNBC News reports this.
According to the television channel, as part of the agreement, Mask will have to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Moscow to retain the position of head of Tesla.
The founder of Tesla is also said to have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount is raised with Tesla.
Money is distributed among affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk, an American entrepreneur on the list of 50 richest people, is a planet on the version of Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the neurotechnological company Neurolink, and the developer of Tesla's electrical panels, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States had previously sued Tesla Ilon Mask, Director General, on account of his Twitter report, of a possible ransom for the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all shares on a fixed price exchange of $420.
The stock cost of $420 was allegedly established - due to its importance in the marijuana culture - previously reported Bloomberg with reference to Stephen Peikin ' s Co-director of Security.
At the same time, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out his shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit brought against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and grieved by these claims.
- Honesty is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break in any way.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Mask, regretting the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the businessman's tweets were misleading, forcing Tesla's stock sellers to purchase paper at artificially overvalued prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Musk’s reckless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilon Muska was charged with exchange fraud with another head of the Citron Research Research Company.
However, if Moscow had been unable to settle its dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it would have been in danger of being removed from the company’s administration and even the prison.
In particular, the CNBC television channel was announced by the former Chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission.
Musk is a good guy who can't run a car company.

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first to be discovered by Fleming.
A few years earlier, he had been cold enough to plant a slip from his nose onto a Petri dish (a glass lid in which he had experience with bacteria) and found in a few days later that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
In almost the same case, he was also diagnosed with penicillin.
Fleming's name has been added to the list of the 100 most prominent persons in the history of humanity.
His discovery, according to many scholars, has changed the course of history.
Penicillin has begun to treat most of the ancient diseases that were considered incurable -- tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...

Nitza called for the expulsion of the Moscow language by Ukrainian product -
Ukrainian child writer and purity fighter Larissa Niezai called for the removal of a Russian-speaking Moscow product from Ukraine and a Moscow language*
To do this she offers the Ukrainian product - - cultural wave, cultural pressure -
For its reasons, the advisability of eliminating Russian in Ukraine - Nicea shared with Ukraine’s publication, Reviewer,
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already there and continues to grow further.
In time, Ukrainians will recover from this Moscow language. She is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been widely used earlier on television and radio, but she had little or no public space.
However, according to Nietza, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in its view, merely - extending the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level -
Nitza had previously shared her experience of maintaining the Ukrainian-speaking regime in the children’s camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of booksshops, one of which had been contacted by Russian.
When he didn't reach his own, he threw Nicaea into the girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is referred to as \"language schizophrenic\" calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nitza recently stated that the name Russi had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not escape the wrath of the writer: when she came in and heard the conversations of the Russian officials, she had committed a scandal and left, slaming the door.
A man’s conversation took place at the break, and it produced its fruits
Protector - Urala - Denis Kulakov - about the victory over Arsenal - (2:1) in the ninth round of the Russian champ.

“ Such a difficult game, a serious man’s conversation was interrupted, and the results came from killing two swords and not missing.
You missed some matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
I felt like I was today
- If you take 90 minutes, that means it's okay!
I really felt good.
Maybe a little bit of strength at the end, so nothing could happen.
And yes, Doctor and Physiother, Vladimir Anatoliev Gashnev, led me to this game for which they're very grateful!
♪ What do you say about the team's atmosphere ♪
It's no secret to anyone that after winning, it's easier to recover, and the spirit of the collective is good.
Now we had a white stripe, although we were black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the pain-stricken...
♪ I've been out playing since I didn't go out ♪
- That's what I've been missing a little bit because it's really a bad situation.
But once again, thank the physiotherapists and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and advised painkillers.
And the rest is second-hand.

The indictment for the Dagestan deputy has become news
The Soviet District Court of Mahachakala has been detained for two months by the deputy of the Dagestan Rajaba Abdulatippov, who is suspected of participating in a criminal community that has shaped disability for bribes.
“It is understandable that the details of the investigation that shed light on the way in which the Russian Investigation Committee did, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramanas Abdulatipas Rajab Abdulatippov, have now contributed to the criminal action of the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Examination, Mahamed Mahaczev and his accomplices.
Among other activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatippov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Mahacev as head of office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for this purpose.
Recall, earlier, the investigation into Magomeda Mahacev, other leaders and employees of the territorial health and social intelligence offices under his supervision, resulted in criminal proceedings under article 210 (constitution and participation of the criminal community), article 290 (receiving of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (service floor), and article 159 (promotion at a particularly large level) of the Criminal Code.
It is clear from the investigation that in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatippov, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahacev and his associates in stealing funds from the Pension Fund, joined the criminal community in their activities.
During his tenure as head of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation for Dagestan and having ties in State authorities and law enforcement agencies, and using his relationship with head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatippov, investigators believe that he has provided the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with government officials to support the illegal activities of Magmed Mahaczev and his presence as head of the federal executed institution - The General Bureau of Health and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan - has organized the illegal installation of disability on the part of citizens -
Following the announcement of this information at the Council District Court meeting on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
'Certainly, everything that is being charged to me today is new to me, and I'm not really familiar with it,' he said.
The Court arrested a member from One Russia, not 10 days before the charges were brought, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months at once, since it had in its case article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the prosecution to be carried out, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Space: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Russia ' s topic was practically missing from the negative key.
The head of the Board of International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the RF as an integral participant in global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have become almost accustomed to in recent years in relation to Russia has now been in order of a more mutiny ” — said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper —
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had, in some cases, identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, the Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, was in this number, in any case, a group of Western countries, which was fairly unanimous in that regard.
At the 73rd session, he stressed to Kosachev, “the theme of Russia in the negative key was practically absent”
“If I carefully examine the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement made by the German Foreign Minister, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any event, the choir was not exactly accurate.”
The Head of the Sowfed case committee does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend which, in his view, would be devoted to the current session [of the United Nations Henasembles], although this may be the entire trend in a year, two or three years later.
“I do not exclude that the present session, in a sense a turning point — to allow Kosachev, explained that — too many examples of how Russia has managed to move forward with its connections in international affairs —
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
So long as it's not Ukraine, unfortunately, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be renegotiated over time, which has added parliamentarians.
This is because he believes that there is an - adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - integral participant in solving the global problems of today -
- I don't want to be wrong, but I feel like we're going somewhere to go, we're not going to move, it's going to move forward, he's added.
Another interesting and important sensation - in this context, Kosachev called a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop -
“I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I have been pleased to see that, if, a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of the world’s happening, on a large scale, no one was interested in the situation, the Chairman of the Sowfed Committee said otherwise.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal order, which stands out in the West, there are no answers to questions about how to solve world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problem of migration”
“And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more apparent” expressed Kosachev’s confidence, stressing that in this sense, “the present session is a good one for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia.”

In Damascus, the right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hoped that the Syrian province of Idlib would not have to use military force, said the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Valid Muallem.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly address the problem of the disbandment of the Russian-ban organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA News:
Head of the MID also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military action to address the problem of the Territories east of the Euphrates if Kurds wished to separatize.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with Kurdish SDF forces were good as long as they were not interrupted by the US.
On 17 September, Putin and President Recep Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry headed a youth team called Chelsea
Previously, a 37-year-old defence counsel had been reported to negotiate a transition to Moscow-Spartak
According to RT with reference to Mirror, the former captain of the England Assembly, John Terry, led the Chelsea youth team -
According to the source, a well-known player who has been a member of the London Club for a long time will be led by a team of at least 23 years of age.

First Vice-Siker of the Supreme Council of Irina Hervánco apologized to a Russian convicted man at the RF for spying, Ukrainian journalist Roman Sušchenko, for not yet being able to be released from the pits.
On this she spoke in a video of a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko FSB.
She said that these days, under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there was an action that had been launched by the participants in a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them are people who know you well, who are starving, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political-owned Kremlins, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, wherever President of Ukraine, Ukrainian power, all of us, required to put pressure on the Kremlin, put pressure on Putin with one demand -- the liberation of the Oleg, the liberation of Román, the liberation of all political prisoners and of those people who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crimea -- told Hervánco.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would strike every Ukrainian, making us worse, more powerful in protecting Ukraine ' s national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, on the understanding of what is good and what is evil -
Recall that Roman Suschenko, a correspondent of Ucrinform in France, was arrested by Russian forcemen at Moscow airport on 30 September 2016.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying at the Directorate-General for Intelligence of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suszchenko to 12 years in a high-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict legitimate.
The Russian jailers satisfied the Ukrainian's last request before stepping into the colony.
NASA reported an approximation of the asteroid earth size from Big Ben
The NASA Space Agency of America reported that the Earth is nearing a large SP1 asteroid, which may reach a length of 160 metres.
According to the Daily Express, the space object may be higher than the famous Big Ben or the London survey wheel.
However, there is still no accurate data on its size.
The speed with which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between the asteroids and the Earth will be 3 October.
It will then fly past our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA assigned him to near-Earth sites.
Previously, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video from the surface of Asteroid Ryugu in history.
Two Japanese bikers (planets) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe succeeded in obtaining a unique human resource.

Wachtang Kikabidze on Cancer Control
Many artists are now describing how they have managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and the stories of popular people about victory over cancer give hope to many.
A well-known actor named Wakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was living only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which appeared to be a verdict.
- I'm like a hammer down the skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
Put it in the hospital.
I couldn't stand the spoon there. I couldn't stand it.
I started to do tests, I think it's bad things, and the artery doesn't leak blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they told me that I had a big fucking bone in my head, and they had an operation.
And in the course of the operation, the doctors for the bones saw the tumor -- -- told Kikabidze in the program --
The tumor proved malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi residents even came to say good-bye with their godfather on the threshold of his home.
But the actor’s wife refused to keep the actor alive, and she believed that she could cope with the illness and had stayed away from her husband’s bed for more than a year.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Always, when I had critical situations, it was close to the rock, and an actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease and now lives happily in his home in the heart of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness are refuting, the untimely end of what both things appear on the Net.
The founders of the Miroworker site have introduced Peter Syyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary.
The pretext was to attack the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine -
In addition, the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of neighbouring countries has been exposed to direct threats from the invasion of Ukraine and to support the separatist sentiment in Ukraine, as well as participation in the organization of provocation aimed at massive violations of Ukrainian legislation.
Note that before Syyarto, the viceroy of Kiev-Pecher Lavra, and the president of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots) of Onufrey, agreed.
Their opposition to the receipt of Tomos by the local church of Ukraine was the result.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Petr Porošenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the sum of the gold parachute, the crowy Zamubernator.
The non-recurrent payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronese Region, Yuri Aguibalov, was made under the Regional Law on State Positions -
At the same time, the real amount of a “gold parachute”, an excommunicated official, was slightly less than the amount announced in the media.
The regional government press service provided such explanations.
Under the law, the salary for the Aguibalov post is 11,189 roubles.
Thus stressed in the press service, the lump sum was less than the income tax of 223,892 roubles than the one million roubles that the media had written about.
The officer received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
His seniority in public office is over nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and the lump sum payments are made immediately after his resignation, and explained to the Agency of RIA News, in the Government of the province.
At the same time, Agibanov’s pension payments were suspended on appointment to public service and his salary had not changed compared to the previous period.
The winning governor of the Verio region, Alexander Gussev, took office on 15 September.
Agibanov was released due to the expiration of his term of office as head of the field.
The term of office of other officials holding public office in the region similarly ended.
On 29 September, Telegram Canal - Nezigar - published documents that indicated that Aguibalova, who had resigned from the post of Vice-Governor, had paid a termination fee of 23 salaries, and two days after that, he had received a similar post without the addition of a vrio.
The Minister called for students to be told about the harm to masturbation
Ischenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that young people of masturbation had provoked the harmful information they found on the Internet.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy has added.
Gennady Iishchenko, Deputy Minister of State of the Russian Federation (on radio interview Govorit Moscow)
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done in the light of the stigma, because there is a risk of a certain child ' s sexual health, both boy and girl.
Objectively, the problem is that children are ripe enough, and there are still large scissors between their sexual maturity and the possibility of becoming formally intersex contacts.
In Ishchenko ' s view, the problem is hampered by the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing - the silence - and the lack of a culture of adequate education.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
The MP believes that it is primarily in hyperurbanized schools to practice lessons on the harm of masturbation.
- If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're just not going to understand you, to put it mildly,' said the professor.

Family members were told of this in the company immediately after the tragedy.

As a result of the tragedy, several cars fell under asphalt, and two young people died locally from burns received.
ADH became second most popular in Germany
The Anti-immigrant “Alternative” for Germany is another popular record, and Angels Merkel’s ratings fall.
It appears that German residents have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel ' s immigration policy, which has led to the country ' s ambitious goal for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most strongly, recent social issues suggest that the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular and that the ruling Merkel and Zeehofer bloc are weak.
This week, the AH hit another record by rising to the second line in the popular sensitivities rating.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 per cent of the population, were able to bypass social Democrats, who had around 16 per cent.
The gap at one percentage point can be written down as a matter of statistical error, but it cannot be overlooked that the 2013 ADH of a small group of Euro-Cepticians has succeeded in becoming a major political force.
General responsibility leadership has so far continued to hold the governing cluster HSS/CDS, which has a total of about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points, as early as April, support for Angela Merkel ' s block was four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor ' s personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for a fourth consecutive period, is also reduced.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in support of Angel Merkel, a 7 per cent lower than last year.
Additionally, the social Democrats were followed by Green - (15%), Left (11%) and Liberal (10%).
Evolution - Alternatives -
The Alternative Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the “Alternative Choice 2013” group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group had initially become an opposition to the Government ' s course, but at first times only dealt with economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation.
However, the group opposed the EU weak economies, Germany, and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German brand and exiting the European Union completely.
Against the backdrop of the growing immigration crisis, the ADH political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took up the Euroskeptic niche and began severely criticizing the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the most recent parliamentary elections in 2017, the AG managed to try the Bundestag for the first time, with 94 members (out of 709).
Two representatives, Alternatives for Germany, are taking seats in the European Parliament.
Published a video of a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens the Bolvan Nation -
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books by the Drosdov Ostap on live, admitted that he considered his compatriots to be a Bulgarian nation,
They believe in TV and they don't read much.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We haven't been introducing a culture of reading and the adoption of texts since childhood,” said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drusdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio, Independent, has begun to combat literature that has the slightest hint of being criticized by the Kiev authorities, banning the importation of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians designed a car in the case of apocalypsis - the magazine Driving
The car can be bought by anyone who wants it.
Roshel Defence Soluctions stated that they already accept applications for their new armour.
Roshel Senator APC armoured apocalypsis
On the subject of the apocalypsis, money is not limited to video game makers, film studios, and bookshops.
The new niche is now being cleared by car companies.
Yes, Canadian Roshel Defense Soluction submitted its armoured apocalyptic Senator APC.
In time, engineers set up armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable, but are fully securely housed in a whole-war armoured armoured unit.
This bunker, or else the design, will not be named because its reservation level meets the B7 standard, is installed on a powerful Ford Super Duty chassis.
Its back, also armoured, can protect the capsule from being hit by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Rochel Senator APC armoured personnel
So that passengers are not even harmed by an explosive wave from a shell that crashed close to the car, the car is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firefighting system.
For safe viewing, the Rochel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a circular camera system with a night vision function, as well as a view armoured tower on the roof.
There's no armor in the car.
Forequarter armoured armoured armoured apocalypsis Rochel Senator APC
In order to prevent the gravity of the armoured vehicle from affecting its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodiesel engine of 6.7 litres, whose full power is transferred to four wheels through a 6-stage automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting stuck in the armoury of the apocalypsis, Roshel Senator APC.
To see the armoured record of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypsis will be available at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., to be held in October.
Name of death of the universe
The universe will last for about 140 billion years, a tenfold increase in the age of the world that has been observed, about 13.8 billion years.
An international research team has been placed in the library of e-preprints arXiv.org and has been published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to such conclusions by observing some ten million galaxies using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the world ' s observed energy mass, scientists, working on the standard cosmological model `CDM (Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously estimated.
The Subaru Observatory press release notes that observations provided a detailed 3D map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the European Space Telescope's data accounting for the Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the present world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to join the initiative of the pension referendum failed
The ability to learn the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
On Saturday, a meeting of the federal initiative group against the promotion of retirement age was held in Moscow.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different wording of the questions (five language texts were registered by the Central Electoral Committee as a whole).
They decided to ask the CIC to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians: “You will not raise the age of old age established by pension security law as of 1 July 2018, upon which citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension.”
The wording was recorded by a sub-group of Volodic, whose representatives did not participate, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding unit.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of a member of the Fair Russia - Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the PRRF (four subgroups).
It was joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezha and Orenburg.
Sviridov used to say, \"Swiridov,\" that invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of some 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, who was the head of the sub-group (its language was supported by 15 more sub-groups), said, \"The premises didn't receive or plan to be invited: 'We didn't understand who is a friend, and who is an enemy.'

Ilon Musk will leave the position of head of Board of Directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to leave the post of chairman of the Tesla Board of Directors and to pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of Chief Executive Director of the company, reporting AFP with reference to the regulator's data.

In the match - Loko - - Akhmat - Turbine's mistakes fell like an abundance of horns.
Former Judge Vladimir Levitin of the Union, commented on the work of the arbitrator Eugen Turbin in the 9th round of the Russian champion Lokomotiv - Akhmat - and dealt with controversial episodes of the game.
- As you're judging by Evgeny Turbin's judgeship in the match - Lokomoiv - - Akhmat -
I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his disapproval of the judges of the Russian Prime League games.
I am surprised that the orders of the fifth tour meeting, Spartak - - - Dinamo - - neither Turbin himself nor the DSI leaders have drawn serious conclusions about his poor qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private misdemeanours of rough receptions would fall as from the horn of plenty.
For example, at 50 minutes, Eder's railwayman falls by hand in his penal square, Ahmata, Rodolfo.
Eight metres from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the toolbars.
- How do you estimate the episode involving Idododo, who was at the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the hand of the lawyer in his penal square.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he's good at seeing the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karassev.
Nevertheless, all three were burned, and the toolbars were not assigned.
So the score was distorted, and the sport justice proved to be wrong.
It was the very case that the judge had, by definition, pushed and buried the sport spirit of the game.
At 52 p.m., Turbin refused to remove the defence counsel of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules against Crichovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
I should've shown you a second mustard.
- Turbine and the first yellow card at this point did not show exactly the case.
The second one would be illogical.
-Oleg Ivanov said after the double standards match that some teams were put on a team for such violations as the one in the Idodo episode, and some people didn't.
What do you appreciate what a football player said?
- It's a double standard.
There was a bra.
They didn't give him.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second bar to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge is watching who's playing.
That's a Saturday-Lokomotiv-and-h-Ahmatah-there's a serious claim to Turbin's work, because the team was hurt.
Matt Damon played rape accused Judge Cavanaugh at SNL launch
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturn Night Live season on NBC TV.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at Senate hearings on the charge of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate had earlier drawn attention to his emotional and detailed accounts during a discussion with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but he said that he never got drunk until he was speechless.
Moreover, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played those points.
I was just doing a lot of dust and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin ever seen.
Everyone knows this, the judge said in Matt Damon's execution.
Kavano had previously been elected U.S. Supreme Justice.
Barbra Straisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior
American singer Barbra Strazand stated that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original songwriter.
- They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it's impossible to clone the soul - it's a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, a coton-de-Tulter named Samantha, to be put down because of health problems.
In July 2018, the dog of Chihuahua was reported to have been cloned 49 times by the nickname of the Chowdo Milli (Miracle Milly), the smallest dog in the world.
Experts are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States was thinking about Russia ' s maritime blockade due to the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, Russia's naval blockade can be launched to gain advantage on the world energy market.
The American authorities have engaged in such a ferocious struggle for the success of the global hydrocarbon market that they are willing to resort to Russia ' s maritime blockade, which remains one of the world ' s major energy suppliers.
The possibility of a maritime blockade on the previous day was shared by Ryan Zinke, head of the United States Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police but does civil functions, including natural resource policies.
Zinke’s statement, therefore, was well within the competence of the department under his leadership, even if it was not without political beauty.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the US Navy was in control of the maritime routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to interfere with Russia's supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lion's share of its revenues from its supply to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy in the Middle East, also as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason for Moscow's revitalization in the region, confident Zinke.
The Minister made it clear that the United States was still looking forward to leading the world's energy market as the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to obstruct Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, an acceptable measure in this direction, is of the view of Zinke.

There's a club in Russia that I'm watching.
Former Captain - Chelsea - and Assembly of England, John Terry - on why they had visited the ninth round of the Russian Champions - Spartak - - Rostow - (0:1).
- I have a club in Russia for which I'm watching.
I've been watching it quite recently, and I've been curious to see it from the side.
I can't say that I'm a pain killer because my heart is \"Chelsey\" -- but the sympathy for \"Sportaco\" -- I have and I want to apologize for the decision again -- brings out Terry's talk-Chelsey website--
Recall that “The 18-point east rose to the third in the tour table, and “Spartak” to the fifth line, with 15 points in the asset.
In the next tour, red and white, on 7 October, they will play with Enisey -- and Valerie Carpin's trustees will be adopted by Orenburg on the day before --
The expensive violin was handed over to the lambard for a point of dispensation.
When a bomber LBC Boutique and Loan man brought a violin to the town of Somerville (Massachussets) for looking old and unpretentious instrument, a pawn worker offered only $50.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old-fashioned and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
It turns out here that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinand Galliano and is estimated at $250,000.
Some of the violin-only jumps are estimated at $16-8,000.
An investigation revealed that the violin had been stolen from a city dwellers for some time and that the instrument had been returned to the rightful owner.
As long as it is not known how the violin got to the person who surrendered it, there is no previous clash with the law behind it.
The manager says that now all the screeching screechers brought into the Lombard will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPF, we are awaiting an exciting confrontation: “Spartak will take a man at its stage in Tushin - the Russians - under Valerie Carpin, a man who is not known to be an alien -
Of particular interest to this meeting is the fact that clubs now have an equal number of points of 15 and have 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-reaching Zenita, and being in the same eye as Crannodar, which is playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-and-whites now have a gruesome strip: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the Masimo Carrera team suddenly entered - Rapidu - and recently returned home - Akhmatu -
After a derby with the CSC, which ended with a fair nobody, Spartac, with a minimum account and was not easily played in the Cubka-Chernauretz, and it was too early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia had come closer to getting out of the crisis.
- The last three consecutive games couldn't win, but the beatings don't know the five.
Let's see if Carpin can continue the losing series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Carpian Rostava-with-Sportac ended in favor of a capital team.

London’s Charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, said British Minister of Defence Gavin Williamson.
But England would defend its values, he stressed during the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are operating in gray zones with cyberattacks and false news, and the Minister added.
But the largest is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly been refuted, passed on to TASS.
Then the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not follow international rules and use chemos.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Solsbury last March of the ex-Col.R. Sergei Scrypal, convicted of spying in favour of Great Britain, and his daughter Julia.
A referendum was held in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the entry into the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of its neighboring Greek province.
One of the first speakers was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, who was a passionate supporter of the Republic ' s name in northern Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today ' s voting.
Jan Petersen, Head of the Monitoring Mission, Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, presented Euronews as organizing the work of the observers:
Approximately 100 teams have moved around the country to watch the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, to the counting of votes and protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams were working in the country to monitor the preparations for voting, the work of the media, the implementation of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Fae Dulgeri: “About 500 foreign observers follow closely the voting process.
Observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to then present them in the final report . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The interpreter compared the Russian and German mentality
The mentalities of Russian and German peoples differ, but not many differences between them do not play a major role in mutual understanding.
This was done on International Interpreter Day, 30 September, and was shared by a technical interpreter, S. Burbel Sachse.
For more than 30 years, she has been conducting translations from Russian and English.
“ The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, have a long time to go.
But I think for the sake of understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, it doesn't play a major role.
According to the interpreter, in order to realize that two countries without one another are not alone, it is sufficient to know history -
And in the future, Sacksa noted, Germany doesn't make any sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, it doesn't make sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there's a lot of things that define our common destiny, she said.
On the day before, German chancellor Angel Merkel stated that the country was trying to establish relations with Russia and maintain them.
She said that for Berlin, mania was particularly important in the pipeline project - North Stream - 2 - built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Putin appointed a new head of the Presidency for Foreign Policy
Vladimir Putin, by decree, released Alexander Manjosin from the post of President of Foreign Policy.
Igor Nebelov has been appointed to this post instead.
Mr. Manjosin has been the head of the President's foreign policy office since 2004.
As one of his reasons for leaving the Kremlin close to him, I guess he referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant claims in the quality of his work for the head of management.
Igor Neverov had previously been headed by the Second European Department of the MID.
In 2009-2014, he was Ambassador of Russia in Sweden.
The Russians sacrificed one rouble to a low-paid deputy.
In Yekaterinburg, the Human Charity Foundation opened a fund-raising fund for the deputy of the State Duma Vera Ganzi, who complained about low wages.
The campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
The Man's Charitable Fund expresses the hope that the world will be able to save the people's servant.
We ask all inequitable people to give a chance for life and a happy future!
All funds collected will be handed over to the poor in person.
Save you God - it's in a fund message.
All the beneficiaries want to raise 380,000 roubles for the deputy, which is equal to a month's salary.
Assistance reports are published on the Wkontakte Foundation page, where the organizers put out a list of remittances.
The most frequent donations are one rouble and 50 copies.
At the time of the publication of the note, the Russians had donated the 1633 rouble to Vera Hanse.
Fund raisers opened on 28 September following a complaint by Ganzi on low incomes.
According to her, the deputy's average salary is 380,000 roubles, which is why they have to spend on the credit card.
Ganza visited that parliamentarians were not compensated for representation costs.
Subsequently, the State party stated that it would consider paying for representation costs to the deputies.

Comedy - Evening School - Debutable to American cinemas last Friday, $28 million earned a rental weekend for its first weekend.
This resulted in the uninvented painting of Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish taking the lead in boxing the United States for 28-30 September.
In the international market, only 20 countries have produced $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line of creation, Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, has quite clearly ahead of another Western procat, the cartoon, the Smolfoot, a curious story of knowing a promising yeth of a human kind that the main character never believed in.
The draft directors, Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reysig, for their starting weekends, collected $23 million, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted a 20-25 million weekend.
With regard to the total charges - Smolfoot - they now amount to $38.6 million (with it debuted in 50 countries), Mexico was the most active here, adding 3.6 million to the loss of the film.
Three of the strongest locked up this time was a children's story - The Secret of Houses with Hours - from Elai Rot's horror master, who has finally proved that the director is able to make a good movie for 12+ audiences.
During her second week of vacation, John Bellers, with the charming Jack Black, and Kate Blanchet earned $12.5 million, bringing the world's total fees to $53.8 million.
Despite the drop-off from top-3, it continues to be a surprise to Paul Fig's sign- +- a trillion with Blake Lively and Anne Kendrick- A Simple Request - in 17 days in the American run-off painting from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not originally expected by the Board - raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has as many as 62.9 million total proceeds.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror - Curse of the monk - who collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off-Clame -- after 24 days in America (and not only of course) cinemas have $330 million of total earnings on their account and, since recently, proudly bear the title of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the spell itself, and two tapes about Annabel's horrifying doll.
Following Corina Hardy's horror, another member of the genre, Debutan-Hellefett, was assigned as a major youth choral of the year.
In his first weekends, a well-known repairman (and from a recent director) named Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked in a number of major choral projects, including the Happy Day of Death, to which Hellfest appears to have earned $5.1 million in jobs in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh steel, the Unsatisfied Asians, which seems not to fall out of top-10 of the American boxer's office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, is, as a result of September, the sixth highest ranking on the gender tape in history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that has so far earned on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.

Add that the next weekend in the U.S. will be all about collecting a long-awaited - Vienna - with Tom Hardy, who - we can be sure - will have no problem with leading the U.S. box after the first weekend of October.
From the other coming week we should highlight the musical melodrama - The star was born - the laureate of the Venice film festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama - Your hatred -

Valerie Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today
Chief Coach Vitija - Valerie Belov - on the defeat of Siberia - (3:4) in the KCL Regular Cup match.
- College talked about painkillers - Siberia - and I want to point out our painkillers - - brings the words of the White Official Website - Vitija -
- I hope they do, too, 'cause now almost every game is a whole stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, the Lord must have been helping Siberia today, because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
We lost the micro game 0:3 to our leading leaders, so it was difficult to get the match out, even though there were moments.
But still, I'll blame myself.
Because, apparently, we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was another team --
- It's an unimaginable touch.
The audience is outraged at Agutin's choice on the show, Golos.
The audience of the show, Voices 60+, is accused of being mentor of Leonid Agutin of being an unimaginable creature and of being in the midst of a knuckle.
When he heard his father's voice from his first notes in blind audition, Nikolai Agutin hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the perpetrator.
But the son's feelings were overruled, and he chose a relative on his team.
Many then felt it was a joke, but they let the mentor know that he was not objective in the first step.
But the joke was prolonged, and the star’s father was completely unjustifiably taking the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not willing to forgive Aghutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, when we saw the show, we resented the garlanding of an unimaginable and frank twisting of our close relatives into the final ladder.
I've already doubted that Agutina's power and conscience to keep her dad out of the way is at the very first place, and we've been talking to Irina Petrovsky and Xinya Larin in the TV programme.
However, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin, Slyll are the fine performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a moving song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience still wants to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that this is not true at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and the finals are really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
♪ I'm sorry for the parties ♪ ♪ The Voices ♪ ♪ Of Agutin's team ♪ they were condemned ♪
“The last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, and today he should have shown himself a professional...
♪ Contest lost its meaning ♪
To remove two talented men from the project and to leave in his dad's project who doesn't sing but whispers as soon as possible to call the mentor.
♪ Like dad sings, get him a Kremlin concert for your money, and see how many people will come to this concert ♪
It's the show, Voice, not the show, Close Relatives,
- Agutin's side was unprofessional.
- Then you have to ask your own show to speak to your dad, not the one that's made for 1 Canale's money.
- That was a real chance for someone and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other actor with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut blind with a beautiful voice and a temper, and Pope Agutin was taken to the finals?
And then we all complain that there are the same faces on the stage and on the screen for decades!
'Cause you can't go through the garb.
What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a tin and a custard.
And the money in the family budget will be no more!
The absurdity's going on.
The users also remembered that a son of Gradsky was on blind audition in one of the traditional Golosa seasons.
Then I didn't have a meter in my head to take my son on my own team.
What's more, he said, \"Come on, get out of here, everything's clear.\"
Agutin couldn't do it as a professional.

The amendments to the Dole Construction Act would require developers to fully lend themselves to the bank.
And many experts have already talked about the possible heavy travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not all of this is agreed upon.
In the centre of Kiev, the robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from the bank.
The incident took place on the night of 29 September on the street of Ivan Kudri and was reported by the city's law enforcement officers.
According to the victim, the unknown one came to him and started a conversation, but then suddenly he raised the knife and demanded that he be given money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the bank card to be removed.
After the attacker received 4,000 grubs and his phone, he hit the victim and hid -- said in the communication.
Law enforcement officers have been able to detain the robber and have been given 25-year-old kiyivin.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
Police are also working on a version of the perpetrator ' s involvement in other such crimes.
Recall, on the eve of Odessa, several resonant thefts of incasators took place.
In one case, armed robbers were caught with a drone.
The scientist described a possible scientific programme for an RF expedition to the Moon.
The head of the Space Research Institute of RA, a correspondent member of RA Anatoly Petrukovic, briefed RIA News on a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing guidelines for such work.
“Consolidated opinion is not yet available” emphasized the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
- This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space-based radio-emitting sources - added Petruković.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be called upon to search the Earth’s satellite for a primitive organism, says a scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Previously, the head of the corporation, Roscosmos, said that in an optimistic version, the RF could fly to the Moon by 2030.
The wrong client threw out the fecals basket in store 7-Elev.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, who's known as the \"Imel tooth\" on the 7-Elev 24-hour network manager: he put him out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
And I decided to take revenge on my enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went into the store and dropped out on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelf containing the basket.
The basket contained the feces and urine that Simms had borrowed from a nearby mobile biotoile.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the avengers -
He was put in prison and released before trial on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of someone else's property and criminal offence and was prohibited from entering the store and from approaching the manager.
While the crime of Simms appears to be more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be severe enough, as it has previously violated the law: it has been subject to large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in an excessive state and ill-treatment of animals.

In the Minister ' s view, there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
First, he would prefer not to use it, so pressure should be put in place and Iranian energy outstretched.

- I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I found myself in between the two cars that got me hit right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, right now, right away.
I'm in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
I was hoping that after the rest of us went to the pit stop, we'd get to the clean air and get back pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus was fighting a partner, he was also in contact.
I understand he's a little wrong.
We found ourselves in such a situation on the most indestructible route of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more.
Recall that Sirotkin, in the race on the Russian Grand Pr, was the winner of the 18th, the British pilot, Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton.

The President of the Federation of Tennis Russia (FTR), Shamil Tarpezhov, commented on the removal of Moscow-Sparta football players-Denis Glossukov and Andrey Jongko from the exercises with the main staff following the swearing of the criticism of Massimo Carrera's chief coach, reports: “Sport weekend-
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Such things are inconceivable nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera does.
This only deepens the disorder within the team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and accept them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it in Carrera's place.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get even.
If Glossyakov and Jznko are having any abusive speech, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of the perception of the situation.
And that doesn't serve as a normal team climate.
Today, Spartan has no game, so this situation didn't have to blow up at all.
Maybe you should just laugh at it together.
The Spartan Republic of Korea has a lot to do with different lines, and there is a discrepancy after the introduction of youth.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match-- sure Tarpezhev.
The two teams will be played on 30 September and will begin at 0900 Moscow time.

A presentation by researchers was given as part of a programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film, Koda Kurchatova, during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, RA correspondent Michael Kovalchuk, presented global challenges as the driving force for the development of civilization.
Scholar’s lecture published on the website of Sirius -
School students have learned that modern technology requires an enormous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing these amounts.
The forum’s organizers said that the environment - like technologies that young scientists are currently working on would help.
Kowalchuk also raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
- The coming of technology like this is a unique thing, it's a great good thing.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of natural technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of the systems of nature.
There's a revolving side, a purposeful intervention in human life.
There's always a risk.
A car appeared, and people began to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology is immediate.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction -- quote scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions.
Speakers were made by the candidate for physics and mathematics, the head of the Curchatov complex of NBEX-Nature-like technologies of NIC-Kurchatov Institute-Julia Diakova, and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBEX Technology, Vyacheslav Demin.

Kemerachian resented a flock of rams at the cemetery
On 30 September, an eyewitness reported on the social networking page that one of the local cemeteries was free to play cattle.
The herds of animals passed between the fences and spewed out grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help in clearing the area from weeds and overgrown grass, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not experience animal behavior on their own:
- These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing rams can do.
The rams, of course, are not to be told they wander, but they are not to be.
In one way or another, an eyewitness pointed out that the problem of animals in the form of cemeteries was already known, and the necessary measures would be taken soon.
To push and lead, how's it going to be right?
There is no word for it.
That's right, you're going to die.
The word to delay - in meaning - to draw, to exert influence, to influence - exists only phonetically, because we hear a sound instead of [a] in the word - to be satisfied.
We use this word to believe that it comes from the word pressure.
But pressure - and - failure - is in a way not only not close, but even in a sense opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
To spend (c.-book, outdated) - that means to be satisfied, complete, sufficient to be sufficient for anyone or something, to be satisfied -
Accommodation, pleasure is related words.
Before, it had a meaning — not to be dependent on anything, to have a self-restraint meaning — to satisfy itself
Old-Slavic-Dival-Thou is a kind of saying to lead-and-will-
Drive, crush are different.
In these words, the truly intimidating birthrights - daos - - - wolk - (sold sheep), deyja - - - to die - and dvaid - - to oppress -
A similar phonetical of the words, pressure - and - to satisfy - as well as an imminent aging of the latter, forced them to become contagion.
That's how we came to have this very thing, d[a] - which is also used in writing through - a - that is not right and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, right, you're going to have a lot of time.
But that word is obsolete, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word \"push\"
You can also use the design to indicate pressure, but remember that it's the office.

By means of an operation in Syria, Russia had shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were killed by RF air and space forces.
This was described on the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of VX, the head of the Council of the Federation for Defence and Security, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air means: the air-to-space forces carried out and continued to strike all precisely at terrorist sites.
According to Bondarev, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian air raids have made the jihadist defense a decisive contribution to the progress of Syrian government forces, transmitted by Interfax
According to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has also protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State - (IG, banned in Russia) and the Jebhat-an-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to Henstab of the Russian Armed Forces, some 4,000 Russian-national fighters and about 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the IG.
It is only those who have been identified, apart from those who have not been identified, who have emphasized the Bondars.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely into our country.
So, said Bondarev, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at far ends -- otherwise it would be evil --

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with that of the fascists
The head of the synodal Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolit Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow to that of the Russian Church in Ukraine with that of the fascists for the Jews.
It's like a yellow star in Nazi Germany and it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for this purpose that this bill was created - a metropolitan area on TV channel - Russia-24 - (quoted by Interfax).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and, to keep it out of the law, is considered a priest.
“It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, and they are the patriots of their country,” he added.
It has previously been known that the members of the Supreme Council are working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128, No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies a change in the name of the Moscow patriarchate UPC.
The viceroy of the Pechayava lavre called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The viceroy of the Pchaiav Mitropolit Vladimir called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (CPC) was published on Saturday on the home page.
At various times, our predecessors and relatives in the faith and spirit of our day had to practice their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats we face, we can see that we will have to survive something,” said the metropolitan area.
He asked for support -- prayer, morality.
The viceroy also emphasized that your physical presence would probably need to be —
The priest added: “Lenine's grandchildren, by spirit, are threatened with destruction, and then we will defend our sanctuary.
To whom the fate of the Pechayava lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and a world shrine, must be prepared to protect it, it is said.
The metropolitan community urged against those who led believers astray.
The UPC has canonical status as determined by Tomos, dated 29 October 1990, from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to be reliant on the news patriarch and the other Catholic pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is not acceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status of our church -- the viceroy of the laurel.
He recalled that the UPC had been independent and completely independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos has a church.
Tomos, who else do we need to do--\" noted the Mitropolitan of Pchaiavic Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other Tomos faiths, or whether they are independent of the Vatican?

You cling to every word, eat food in a normal, normal family - wrote @nataliama37.
There were others who suggested that Bouzov address psychologists or at least read books on the subject.

I really liked the first period.
They didn't use some good moments.
During the second period, the rival gave us a bit of pity, and we stood up.
But the removal of us has fed us a little bit--
The guys were playing great, they were doing a training.
I think if we keep playing right, we'll win.
They didn't kill, they didn't win, but the game content was right.
Good luck, if we keep playing in this direction -
- In your view, 'Automobilist' added to the meeting in Lower Novgorod

At the pre-session, teams were performing other tasks, and many young boys were playing.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
- Automobilist is a good, kind team.
The tour table makes sense, the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in both the arena and the city.

Good defense, good gatekeeper.
Hardly, we were ready.
