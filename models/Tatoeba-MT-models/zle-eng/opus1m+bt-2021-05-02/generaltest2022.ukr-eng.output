Zelensky: Mariupol — heart of war, stop fighting — we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Zelenski believes that the battles over the eastern Ukraine and, in particular, the Marioupols, will determine the course of war - and if the ZSOs fail there, the Russians can abandon negotiations and recommence the de-occupised territories.
Direct language: “Maryupole is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have pulled off a great crowd of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east of the States, in the (area of) the EPA, and if they're stronger, the victory table will be closer for us and we'll have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all of these ways, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we've de-occupised right now.
They can go to this one too.
Then our winning situation will be weaker and probably not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the Ukrainians ’ torture, but “we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have ”
Direct language: “People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any kind of peace under any conditions.
But if we don't speak emotionally, war should end in peace, or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million casualties, all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there's no people.

With the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.

The Chief Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel involved in the commission of war crimes in Bucha Kyiv province.
The General Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reports this to Facebook, according to Ukr.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
GUR MO of Ukraine has received a list of 64 military personnel from a separate team of gunmen directly engaged in war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha,” the report states.
HOUR MUST point out that for crimes committed against the Ukrainian civilian population, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can see the list by reference.
The Ukriform reported that Ipny, Bucha, Gostomeel, and all of Kiev were released from Russian invaders.
The liberated cities and villages have recorded massacres by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people had been buried in brother’s graves.
On April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken away from Russian invaders in the Kiev region.
On February 24, the President of Russia, Volodymir Putin, announced a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders fire and destroy key infrastructure objects, carry out massive shelling of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, fire-fire jet systems, ballistic missiles, and aircraft.

It's great that I have two months' rent, and in Olomouc, the district doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse by civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of tortured and shot people have puzzled the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?
But I was not surprised at all, and that's exactly what I felt sad about waiting for.
I took the children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
And then the girl-college with the kids, and only then came back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently assisted the ZSO, and I have never doubted that my family has not been spared in the event of the occupation of the predominance of Kiev.
Because I was absolutely sure that the rotten Communist-KDB regime had remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zitomir.
A few years ago, the C.B.A. was given to remove a copy from the shooting business of the foregleam — the whole matter is over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, he denied.
Ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor one-way, never-on-the-board.
The fact that they had a number of cows and had a handkerchief was enough to tame the cook and the nursing mother - in - law of young children for execution.
The parents did not even know about the burial site.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give false testimony were killed.
There's a name for Sharia knocker in the carnage.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if my relative was a KGBB informant.
Apple from the apple tree is known to fall...
Ethnic Russians were the shot down three of the peasants.
In analyzing the matter, he became interested in various informational resources.
There are great information resources in Russia that are like the \"Best Death Bar\" that are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in the modern race, the descendants of the NCVDists found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
Like they found files with child pornography on the computer, they put them in jail, and they died quickly.
The CD Battles are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their action now?!
There is a concentration of the most monstrous traits of human nature.
Over the centuries, slavery and imperial chauvinism took place on the surface of the thousand-year-old Ordinian tradition in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then over what came out, they made a beastly genetic experiment by cutting out the intelligence over a few waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French film \"Chexist\" in 1992, that's what happened.
So you saw my photos in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from my cough?
I'm sorry. I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't tell them.
Do you like it, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to leave tomorrow?
We're really not comfortable bothering you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

As reported by the European Truth, welt writes about this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the edition, a corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 Howlers, including a teaching kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is suggested, goubbics are offered at Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While fighting tanks have to get relatively close to the targets of the enemy, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circles, with reference to KMW, the supply of self-propelled Howers will go in a circular way.
Bundesver will, in the shortest possible terms, give Kiev 100 of its gourds, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new Howlers can be installed 30 months after the contract was signed, or earlier, in the latter half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.

The branch office in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to send and process requests for help, so there is an interpreter on the site.
Lydia was already taken to school, but we'd be going to my teacher's teacher on Tuesday, so I told her this morning.
I'm sitting, holding earphones, listening to music, thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, my love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I treat it like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
That's why I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know what's going to happen.
I need to go through a food license test, can I do this to you?
Please send me tomorrow for five guests to prepare the apartment.
Fifth place, do I understand that in the TV room?
A couch? A couch?
Can we stop by before Mrs Margaret finds our home?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's been used, but it's a working one, but it's not needed.
Write a Czech address, look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan with furniture this week I want to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
Sorry for answering so long, working was a day, hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want you to be with you at last, to be able to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me what you like.
There's already a bed and a bath for the baby, and I've found it for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me, how you'll be able to do it, but don't give it to me.
I want to make a cut called the cap.
She's better off not getting infected.
Only I'll be a little later -- around 8:00 a.m.
I don't want any misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried it's all right!
Because we didn't even talk to those excars!
I understand how important this is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry I just woke up, I'm bad.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cola and I had a bad turnaround yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek) to help me with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them too.
If that's possible, I'd like to get mathematical terms on weekends.
Geometry is actually hard, but we have to work with Cole so that there's no error.
Thank you for testing tasks.
We hope so too.
And so she's very happy with any gift.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet with his Czech number.
Yesterday, at 402 bus stops, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed we'd be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to have experienced my heart.
Branch office in Hall No. 29 specifically designed to send and process requests for help
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid anyone wouldn't come.
I haven't walked, yes, it's ripe, it's me, it's important that you've taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust - Babin Yar Memorial Center in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babine Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of “the social basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the basis that we must defend -- this is also part of our responsibility to our history --
If “wicked demons of the past appear today in new clothes, ” he said,“ then for us Germans there can be only one answer: Never again!
Fighting must be sustained.
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the cities that were being blocked, and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually speaking, like shootings in the Granny Yar.
For over a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not long been unimaginable.
Germany is diverting the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But “Never again ” means more than just taking a stand against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means of combating massacres, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy path without the risks and victims of overcoming evil and stopping the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you last night.
We agree, make arrangements for the tour, and write when to be gathered
Everyone was sick only Lydia didn't have an omicron of a new kind of coffee.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
This plate I'm using instead of kars.
Why don't you get caught up in late papers?
The ticket cost me a guide 2,000 gigs
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian social science showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO entry, and only 18% of those surveyed were in charge of -
After the Hydration Revolution, the flight of Victor Januković, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall and the number of supporters grew.
Since the outbreak of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine ' s entry into NATO among Ukrainian citizens of over 75%.
Despite the support given to Ukraine's entry into NATO and its war aid, there is now much criticism about the Alliance and its members -- for their timeless supply of weapons, their refusal to close the sky, their reluctance to \"praise\" Russia.
Moreover, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and that Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the podcast, the questions - along with the editor - of the European Truth - talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance has been criticized in vain, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the Russian victory can become the second Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I have my partner's volt that's my statement on the table.
I gave it to her because of this mobile app.
No visa, we have to go to the convention center and learn how to do this because it was formed in Poland, and the visas were not given but were given a pesel.
We'll write it to you!
I'm going to Dennis today in a good mood.
He arranged for a boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because I don't like it, I don't need it for long.
In Ukraine, the Czech Republic is reported to have sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting there for three to four years and going home because I can't leave anymore.
With you, brothers, 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a genuine feeling for this man, but he did not do so well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after some time, he telephoned him for a heart operation.
I asked him to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we had a lot of communication.
I started working in parallel at the time.
His support also helped me at that time.
So much mutual help.
And I wondered, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he invited me to marry, and two days later he died.
Thus, God chose our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find accommodations, and I'm very happy to do that. - Now I have a place to live and have a place to be with my baby.
You had to remember me before?
(Laughter) Because I helped see the kids in the family.

I realize that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, do I have to give her paper?

You made me feel better.
Okay, give me something second, I don't sleep like that, I'm going to fall asleep and I dream they're bombing.
God is never late, his time and place.
I don't think he's going to rob me of :)
I understand the value of unskilled labor, and I realize that work like I had at home in Kiev, I can't have it here, and the money I made at home is not going to be paid here either.
But just sitting there and not doing anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head are licking so you have to do some kind of physical thing.
At the airport, papers are issued from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at other times you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them to ourselves.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen and put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to Airport with them.

But that's my opinion.
Her uncle gave me the rollers and the skateboard, she was riding them at home, so she's got it.
I also got up at nine o'clock, and only now I'm making breakfast.
I'm really ashamed that you're talking to me on your weekend.
We want to report a change in the apartment and then submit documents to continue the map
We're now bringing medical oxygen to every hospital in our country.
I also forgot to tell you that there'd be a snack for tomorrow.
One mother said it's hot for kids to have doughnuts and jams.
He's coming to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments a month ahead, though for the approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember any of this.)
The Russian army threatens to strike Kiev: “The former things have not been done like this ”
Conashenko's direct language: \"We're going to have to try the diversions and the task of hitting English troops on objects in the territory of the RF.
If such incidents continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously abstained.
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the early days of a full - scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25 Russian missile remnants that hit the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a apartment building in the capitals of the Late West.
On February 26, Russia’s rocket hit a multistory on Valerie Lobanowski Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television show on the Roadside near Granny Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian PPO systems were hit by Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense’s building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the occupiers' rocket destroyed the building and the Trolleybus in Kurenov, Kiev.
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit the Vinogradar’s housing force, causing 19 others to die, including four children.
On March 21, Russia’s rocket attack destroyed the modern Retroville Tropic on the Vinograder, killing at least four people.
Mer Kieva Vitali Kliczko, on April 13th, told the residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city before returning early.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians could still strike in Kiev and that there were many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Chief Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12, that Russians planned to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and to justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, at Whiterod in Russia, oil was exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopter.
Early in April, Belgoroda’s local authorities claimed that the Ukrainian projectile near the city seemed to be . . . .
Obviously, the elites in Washington, D.C., and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat from the thought that the Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine will be shot down by the Nazi fighters.
But Zelensky does not speak to them as much as to their voters and societies in general.
By his speeches in parliaments and before the multi-million - dollar crowds on the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have ever been available.
Zelenski doesn't persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose to do it.
And these talks, these sophisticated alloys of strength, arousal and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Baiden is categorically against the closing of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against Ukraine’s prompt entry, the process is already in progress.
I understand, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.

The head of the Office of President André Hermak reported that Russia was beginning a “fee operation” about the weapons that the Allies are handing over to us.
Hermaka’s direct language: “They realize they are losing the war, seeing their backwardness and seeking to ‘ knock down ’ arms supplies by whatever means.
For example, one of the last fairy tales is the destruction of the U.K. C-300 handed over by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Primer Edward Heger.
What's going to happen?
They may launch fairy tales that Ukrainian soldiers pretend to be weapons of ally, and it goes massively to the military of the Russian army.
I want to warn you of such fairy tales right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the ZRA send the enemy solely to this world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation following evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine and that Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation”.
“Reports of the killed, raped and badly wounded by the Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians worth their sentences”, stated New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents \"a violation of international law\".
The announcements were made after reports of hundreds of civilians being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or abandoned on the streets in the outskirts of Kiev, in Buchy by Russian troops who left the area after being occupied for several weeks.
The photos that allegedly depicted bodies of dead civilians with hands tied up shocked many and called for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
French president Emmanuel Makron stated in a radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed \"war crimes\" in Butch.
“What happened in Bouchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to Russian exports of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, said that Russian troops could go so far as to make a “genocid” in Bouchi.
“We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes do not go unpunished, ” said Sanchez in Madrid.
On public television late on April 3rd, Russian MIC spokesman Maria Zacharov dismissed the charge as “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had \"conquered\" images to discredit Russia.
“ In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first few minutes after the appearance of these materials gives me no doubt who \"conquered\" this story,” said Zacharov.
In the past, the Minobanas of Russia had also claimed without evidence that the Buchi image was “another set of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather on April 4 to discuss what it called “the provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bouchi.
On April 4, the Russian examining committee issued a statement announcing “investigations” in connection with the charge of spreading“ notoriously false information” to Ukraine about the actions of the Russian forces in Bouchi.
Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelenski spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian forces of committing \"genocid\" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
“ I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out, ” said Zelensky in a video conversion from English to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For those murders, for those tortures... for the shots in the back of the head,\" he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military officers should be held accountable for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
\"When we find people with hands tied behind their back and beheaded, I don't understand,\" he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 miles [35 km] northwest of Kiev.
A reporter at the Ukrainian Radio Liberty on April 2 saw as if they were civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Buchchi.
One of nine people's bodies, all civilians, were scattered on the ground near a place that the local people said was using Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a close distance.
Generally speaking, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which was controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything from the list.
“ They said to them: Kieva was not, ‘ How do the scooter took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus? ’
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
In this list, there is another point about which there is now much less information — the removal of the local population to enemy territory.
From about the middle of March, Russian occupants are evacuating the Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which President Lukashenko, self-proclaimed, virtually gave to the Russian military militia.
“Ukrainian truth” has found Ukrainians and their relatives who have been deported to investigate how the evacuation takes place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text were forced to evacuate outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and without exit.
Fortunately, they're alive and they're in contact with family members.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopolis, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second maternity home, took children without parents from there, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the dead champion Joseph Zacepinski of Ukraine.
Alexander's family, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Walli, moved to Gostomell a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antónov Airport, which is about two miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although they were civilians.
As true plates, Dennis and Marina collected anxious suitcases in advance, but the morning of February 24th failed to evacuate.
They had no car, and no busses were taken from the suburbs.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17 until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not all of them decided to follow.
“At the 6th evening of February 24th, people came up and spoke and not Russian and not Ukrainian.
They ask: “Easy, who - I say so. ♪ Come on out ♪
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there was a gun.
All the men were questioned as to whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: “We have come to protect you according to the direction of Ramzan Kadirov.
It was a Chechen MON, not even an army, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said: “We were assisted in the war by the Ukrainians, Sashko Bily (in charge of the UN-UNSO-Viking Nationalist movement) who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Czech War, UP), and now we have come to help you ...
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say that water, she had a big problem.
They broke up the store, took the goods out of it, the Russians would take it away, and they brought us six.
There's a video on the web where kids thank Kadir for their food.
This is how they brought the sausages after shop robbery and said: “We realize this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmadovic...
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says: “You have seven days to give away our phones.
They've separated themselves from the Russians all the time.
They said it's good that they came because they didn't want to fight, the Ukrainians support and they're good at it: \"Putin is a freak, too, Kadir, but we can't do anything because our families are there\"
And most of them didn't fight, but they were going to rob stores, they were pillaging.
The chicken was driven, one was tied to one leg by a georgian ribbon, and the other by his white cattle and called her a militiaman.
In Ukraine they have come at all unprepared.
I don’t know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten up in Buchy, so that they didn’t even kill them, they asked us: “You have an artillery...
What is more, we had the conspiracies that the Chechens did not know each other; in the early days, we asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or their own.
We had them before March 13, and then we had a Russian MON, followed by an Omish umbrella.
They put 30-40 units of technology in between the houses -- we were constantly getting into it from the \"Byractors\"
But these came and told us that the U.S.A. was gone, but it is “Azás — and they said, ‘ Azás ’ to be 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative, “Kyev has already surrendered, ” has been in motion since early March.
One day a Russian came to us, or an umbrella officer, or an FSB representative, and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - there was a Buchu, Gastomel, thought maybe we were given a “green corridor. ”
Right from the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact Ukrainian command.
But we are told: “We are taken to Belarus, and then perhaps to Rostow...
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To what did they reply: “Alas for your children’s mental health ”
As it worked, they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house -- or \"Grades\" or mortars.
And then it came back... and the neighboring houses were just burned down, some of them fell down.
Our house had a direct third - floor strike.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland - saying, “You are being shot there, you are selling to the organs...
We were taken through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road there were combustions, broken machines, even though the Belarusians told us that Russian technicians were being taken to them.
There are so many caponiers, buried technicians, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian pass point, the Comar, we passed the improvised control, many of us without documents, because they were burned.
We were placed in the Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear the shots fired, the rocket fired, and you see the trace -- it worked -- Iskandar -- in Kiev.
Although these white - colored Red Cross said: “No, it’s planes flying, turning at the border. ”
But we're aviation, we have education, we understand that.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the Sanatorium Chonky near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Basil Stepanović, came and said: “Here, I am the hohol, I am from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until your thieves have caught up with them.
Poor people are suffering!
We got Lukashenko so good!
He will tell, and he will be.
They offered to interview white journalists, but no one wanted to.
The Sanatorium administration told us: “You are traitors now ”
And people from the Red Cross and from the UN (at least so called) were spreading misinformation that men are not allowed to travel to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents -- my daughter had no passport.
We had to get him on Monday, and on Thursday, war broke out.
In the Ukrainian Consulate, we received no help, and in Minsk, at the station, we were told that without passports, no one would be on the bus.
I'm going to say that the Belarusian volunteers were very helpful.
We were settled in Minsk, and we were escorted.
At the sanatorium, they were not held by force.
Our second group, the migration representative, said you could live here for as much as a week and a half, because Belarus wasn't Europe, there's no payout.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we passed near Mozir (about 50 kilometers [50 km] from the Ukrainian border of UP), we saw ballistic missiles launched in Ukraine — the rocket first flies out, it glows beautifully, and then it extinguishes.
The people who boarded the bus in Mozira reported that the Russians were constantly shooting polygons there.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us she'd break a son if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, does not believe at all.
They say: \"You lie, we are a peaceful people\"
Their range is not perceived to be used for shelling in Ukraine.
Friends who took us to Estonia waited in Poland.
Now we're going to register, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the flags are probably as much as those of Estonia.
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel along with her brother's family, his wife and two children, the 18th and 22nd years.
In the morning of February 24th, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most basic items and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a nearby building.
Marina herself was unable to return home, and in principle she could not — the house was gone.
No one knew much about the evacuation.
Can't you be in the center somewhere on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. We've always been waiting for you to visit.
Thank you for the bargain, the moths are beautiful.

On April 1, the city’s head, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced a joyful message. “ The Ukrainian military, on March 31, freed the city from Russian invaders.
The following day, the occupants were expelled from the whole of Kiev.
However, the joy the Ukrainians would experience at that time was overshadowed by horror and hatred, since at the same time it was clear that at least 280 civilians were shot by Russians alone.
They were killed just on the street, and some were tied up with their hands and shot in the back of their head, some of them were killed by minors.
Killed and followed by torture were the chief of Motijin Olga Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and son, Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in brother's grave, Igor in sewerage.
A 20 - mile [20 km] highway from Kiev revealed the bodies of several naked women wrapped in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there's no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
I had to deliver it yesterday, but nobody was in contact with me and the link was not delivered, and the DHL website says that the recipient could not be found.

President Vladimir Zelenski stated that certain weapons provided by Western partners had arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, a passage published by the Office of the President, writing “European Truth ”
“All the equipment, all they send, for some equipment it's done too late.
So what if we're talking about Mariupal, for example, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes -- said Zelensky.
To the question of whether this was enough weapons for Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The President also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, there would be no such war, or it would look different.
“It would have turned out differently, we would have had a close neighbor’s shoulder, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be any war--he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military aid, which includes armoured equipment and anti-ship weapons.

Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and English television at all.

And 1+1 is the proprietary, propaganda channel, it's not really interesting to me at all.
What happened there with the man that the police and the ambulance came?
Diane didn't answer me and you
Okay, I just need to print out the paints to the kids, so it'll be fine.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm trying to make you feel satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but who is studying in the Czech Republic, specializing in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with your kids and your grandmother.
I want you to be with me.
In general, it is hard for someone else’s country to get home every day.
Mrs Agatha, if you want this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make life our best here.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.

So thank you so much, Ana. I'm still laying a route in the geolocation in the phone so that we can get to it more quickly.

“ I tell her that ‘ the repair of the TV and the radio receiver ’ has been extended through import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to let the phone shut down when it is telephoned ’
“The whole month we hide from the mother - in - law of the war.
So far it's working out.
However, in the Cable (Cake - UP) on the pool and the back paws, the fur has been licked — it can be from stress, changes in feed, and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and the stress on me does not depend, unfortunately.
Unlike her mother - in - law, she is deaf, she hears sirens, and explosions.
Because Olga is misheard and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her “incognito ”
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oxane of Poland took up arms for the first time in his life.
- I lived with her in the apartment for 33 days.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was around was as formal as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke up, I gave her my receiver -- she listened for four hours, then she sang two hours.
The radio was always at bedside.
Most of the time, the mother - in - law spends most of the time in her room.
It doesn't feel good, it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and television.
And then I called all the people who were talking to her, and that's 6-7 people.
I asked you to talk to her about anything, not about war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th, I'm cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I didn't think about it.
Hi, if tomorrow we need more help we can come
Do you want to order, or can you take a lunch out of the house?
I suggest the cuts to the men, the ladies, the children, with the exit to you, all the people who have fallen asleep, please write in their personal messages, the price:
I understand you and I don't complain, but in my situation I'll be looking here for it.
I'm telling you, the embassy's got the numbers here,
The British, who in the U.S.A. defended Mariupol, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a military official of the Marines Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defense of Mariupola, told his friends and family that they would make up weapons and surrender to Russian occupants.
Source: twitter page of Adin Aislin, a British who had served in the U.S.A. since 2018, U.S.A. with reference to Aislin’s family and friends, Atlas News, referring to the words of Aislin’s friend who spoke to him
Literally, twitter Aislyn: “We received a message from him: ‘ After 48 days, we tried our best to protect Mariupole, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end.
Eislin served in the 36th separate U.S. Marines Brigade, which is involved in the Mariupol Defence Operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of Military Officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son had reported that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brian Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last phone conversation, Eislin had spoken about the plans of their surrender unit.
He said that ammunition and food had ended in the brigade.
Journalists at Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit was about to surrender to Russian units so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the forces of the so-called \"Caders\"
The social media also distributed audio recordings of a telephone call that Eislin is allegedly talking to an acquaintance of an American friend who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aesslin said that they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British had previously told him that Instagram had been threatened by the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017, he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially entered the U.S.A. and made an oath.
Eislin's friends and close friends called Johnny, and in the social media he's better known under the nicney Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.

A brother in the Máriopolis war, a friend in Zaporozhye, and a man today from Kiev were transferred to Harkov.
Every day they're saying it's okay, and whoever knows it, they're not going to tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come here, but I still wanted to handle some things.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll be back tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I would have to talk to Daniel.
Major attackers have played a full game for their casualties.
The teacher, Dmitr Pavlic, was shot, by a man unknown in the name of a relative, the young man, Boris Aleksienka.
Their bodies are thrown into \"a deep pit that the earth has fallen asleep.\"
The memories of “some sort of dead silence in the city”.
From house to house, there was a few passersby who had run from house to house.
On the streets all the time, the bodies rolled by the Bolsheviks were encountered.
Maybe I'll go after you, I need you, I can't go without you.
3. What would your own activity/activity help you or your friends to adapt better to life in Czech Republic?
But you won't, because there's a reconstruction of the railway and a closed entrance.

Then, when the lump is cold and the dough comes, with sticky cakes and a little fire on the oil.
Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we set up tomorrow night, I'll get him and I'll get him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank those who helped us because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work, as I lived in a village too, so I can and can enjoy working physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, we're having Christmas like this.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved a draft law, 7176, which is entitled “Towards the monitoring of the potential threats to Ukraine’s national economic security” -
It's strange that essentially the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security has been found in the economic sphere... a place where members of the observatory board hold and hold banks.
Initiators of the project believe that decisions taken by the statutory board of the company in Kiev can solve national security problems in Ukraine.
We know a lot of new dangers for the holding companies, but so far we don't know about any company that needs to have a physical board meeting at the location.
The potential threat from such a law was understood to be a good basis for \"to take away \" all gains in heavy business reform after the Hydration Revolution, including independent oversight councils, and then to establish manual management.
That was by 2015.
Why should I hold oversight boards, and who should join them?
Moreover, - if under patriotic slogans - take off - one harmful law-making project, others - for example, can take off tomorrow - the public procurement system through ProZorro or NBU independence.
Many things can be written down for war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war began and the law-making project was 7176.
So on February 22, this was added to the comparison table of Law Project 5397.
In general, the desire to open the board in one way or another circulates among some national voters has long been the case.
Not for the sake of criticism, but for the purpose of showing the possible consequences of a legal project, let us consider the arguments that explain the need to accept it.
And then we're going to come up with some suggestions on how to deal with the issue of business management during the war.
Dennis Cudin, the first deputy minister of economics, explained the need for such a innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would prevent remote surveillance.
In other words, the risk is that the oversight board won't be able to make the necessary decisions, because of what might be a paralyzed company job.
We agree that such a risk is present, but will it prevent surveillance members from moving to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a rather cynical situation where independent oversight councils (which make up the majority of the rest of the stock) will put their personal security ahead of the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case they can be released according to the law.
And then it's probably going to lose the quorum that the oversight board needs to make any decisions.
Instead, it is not possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the board, since the law requires a competitive selection, which lasts three to four months on average.
Hence, the 7176 decision proposed by law - enforcement is likely not to save the opportunity to make decisions from loss of oversight and, rather, to the contrary!
The National Deputy, the author of the Dmitro Nataluh bill, gives other reasons for his support.
In particular, he notes: “Many businesses, such as the defence complex (OPC), now need to be relocating — and therefore, it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna through Zoom, discuss addresses and other sensational information —
For the first time, Ukraine has little or no CSOs that have oversight of the Councils.
The Board of Oversight is, except in “Ucroboronpromi”, which essentially governs almost all of the PKK business.
But even in “Ukroboronpromy”, according to legislation, the oversight board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties on a non-free basis.
All authority in “Ukroboronrom” belongs to the Director General, who will, by the way, make decisions about the need for a relocation of a certain PKK enterprise that is part of the concept.
Moreover, this argument does not stand up to criticism because the 7176 bill does not change the law in any way, which governs the activities of the PKK.
Mr. Dmitro, on his Facebook page, also cites arguments that can be classified as “emotional” .
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the effectiveness of restraints and restraints, but let us try to understand some of them: “The important foreign experts at the first word ‘war’ is leaving Ukraine as early as 2021, but there are still members of the oversight councils of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from war.”
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine, and only periodically came here.
That's why to say that they're \"getting Ukraine\" -- it's not fair to say.
Second, as a result of the coronary pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long resorted to online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, with business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And you don't want to forget that board membership isn't a full-time job.
They tend to have other jobs, and they're actually electronics that help them do that.
Third, all these claims are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitro does not present identical claims to members of the Ukrainian oversight councils.
Because they're not in the position of finding their companies either.
In fact, it's not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from surveillance councils, and war is just a new opportunity.
I'm in Ukraine looking for options for temporary family accommodation with me two children.

We usually need an adult passport.
In the Brovar, Vishgorod, and Bouchansk regions of the Kiev region, which were released from the occupiers, an increased curfew will be introduced for two days.
Pavluk’s direct language: “In the settlements of Brovar, Vishgorod and Bouchan district under Russian occupation, freed by the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the curfew was increased!
In the area of these cities and villages, there will be restrictions from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the obelisk’s head, during this time it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets and in other public places, to travel by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out during an alarm to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - clean up and free up territory.
The omelinuk urged people who had left these areas to keep from returning home.
In the rest of the country, the curfew will last from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. daily.

The Lukashenko regime forcemen detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of the two relay cabinets of the Osipovics, which provide the traffic of railway trains.
Source: “Radio Liberty — Center of Law - Spring — Chief of Criminal Police, MAF Gennadia Kazakević, quoted by the State Information Agency - Belta -
In the Navy, Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three people in Bobruisk were detained, and one was wounded.
According to the report, men were actively opposed during detention and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a hospital.
Others were provided with medical attention locally.
The MAF Chief of Criminal Police, Belarus, Gennadia Kazakevic, stated that “the attack of terrorism on the RB railway will be severely stopped — by gun-powered forcemen.
On April 6 it was reported that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, a employee of the Baronovitsk Department of BWC, and an administrator of the thematic resources of the BWC in “Wkontaktio and “One Classicipants - Valentina Samosuka. ”

The United States bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin's RF, Alpha Bank's largest Bank and Sberbank's RF banks, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
That's what we're talking about in a report on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any assets they have in the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a total ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Baden will sign a new decree that prohibits new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision of more than 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms - this is in the White House statement.
The third step of the new U.S. sanctions was to restrict the major Russian state enterprises to critical areas.
It will prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and Prime Minister Michael Mishastin
Sanctions disengage them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

And I also met Mrs. Lena and I talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if he's gone to school.
They isolate the Russian office by stopping investments and stopping supplies.
However, we did not get along.
The military did not live in our home.
Our home is next to the military and oil.
He was just helping me because I wouldn't do it myself.
I'm kind of ready, I don't ask too much, and I'm giving you good advice.
I'm glad.
It's a little difficult for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
I'll see you on Thursday, and I'll tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
How often you clean up
I clean every week
I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard the information for the apartment, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a decent girl's apartment.
If you may know that, let me know.
I won't let you down on your part.
Thank you in advance.
She hasn't written you another woman for 54 years.
I think it's better if you make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's one of a kind of birth:)
Mr. Reyrard, I'm sorry I didn't see you.
We're going to the Medical Commission.
I mean, you have to do another day, not this hour.
On what day is she better off early? (May the day be a little bit more work?)
I'll hear you tomorrow, it's not working well on the Internet.
You're the lucky thing you're gonna do.
Thank you... for finding something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners except the alphabet don't know anything
Nothing's happening.
May I have 25.04 a.m. on Monday?
You can have kids with you, you can have toys here.
I think of Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how this is going to be paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes we gave you?
It's not my day. I'm broke in the living room. It's one thing in the morning. It's another night.
Something came from you, I don't see that.
I too am very sad.
I'll remind you later about the fact.
You have only your father speaking and understanding Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean the house, and how many windows do the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I suggest you read Joe Dispens, and he's researching the effects of external factors and the formation of new bonding neurons.
TV journalist +1 ~ Natalia Nagorna published on April 12th, a video to be transmitted to the 36th Marine Corps of Mariupola on the morning of the morning.
In it the military say that they have no weapons left to engage in battle, and the mountain of wounded.
They said that “the count goes for an hour —
Prior to this, on April 11, a separate team of 36 Marines working in the defense of Mariupola published a Russian address to the Ukrainians.
It was stated that April 11 could be the last battle for Mariupol's defenders, and Ukrainian military command was not in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
Skeptics were told in social media that the statement was published in Russian.
Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander Valerie Dependent assured us that the connection between command and defence forces in Mariupoli is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public debate.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters from the Azostal plant in Mariupoli and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped an unknown substance of poison on Marioul.
According to leader-Azoza-Andrey Blitzki, the RF army has used chemical weapons over the Azostal plant, which is holding the regiment-Azov's fighters-
Thank you, I'm going to fit under you.
The situation is the same as the one we're staying here for now.
( 2 hours drive )) walking, mom shopping, and back )
It's not important.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech - drone squadron has now begun flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional Coptics - will be used for detection, and some will be used to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zacarpatian and two Czech “birds” were sent to Ukraine yesterday, thanks to Mukacheve’s deputy Vladimir Labutenca.
Today, however, their inter-Gierranian friends, led by a village council leader and coordinator, https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasil Schurr, delivered drones for their assignment, received special units from Ukrainian troops in various cities, where fighting is now ongoing.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of the Coptics, the location of the Coptics is now kept secret.
Four friends who are helping the Czech army to stop the attack say that many more interesting presents will be sent to Ukraine as soon as possible in the days to come, serving the destruction of the Russian occupation and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I like sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to work.
If it's all right, I'll agree.
I'm going to try it myself, but if you're going to break in, I'm going to write to you if you can?
The Need for Understanding One Another
We were in person in the old lady's village in Iowa, she saw me, and I was pregnant, but she said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and her mood will rise.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think today I'm frozen on the street.
I drink medicine and tea, and I feel worse but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you've got.
Mom and Dad Should Listen
You'll find it near your little brother's wheel.
It's got to be warm tomorrow.
But no harm to destroyed homes, the damage done to people being mistreated
At Hersoni, the carriages were destroyed by memorial - Slovene in Hersoni on the street of Perkopsk.
Details: Unknown ones have broken the flag of the European Union, destroyed panels with pictures of the Heavenly Hundreds and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The Occupants stole portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundreds and the dead members of the Russian-Ukrainian War.
Taken down the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the carnage, we didn't have this habit, so we didn't know it, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given.
Czechs have someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I live in a dorm's Before twelve there's people and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was in a manger today.
Even today, I was sleeping there.
That's why we're making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the warbles another time!
Today I don't have the power to do it.
Since I'm pushing away from the days and time that there's work to clean the apartments after the guests, I can say about April of the month, because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May of the month, I'll be able to say something about it at the end of April or early May.
Just asked if you had anything to say about it....
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't make the dinner for a while, and I'm a little asleep.
If you don't mind yet, could I come today?)
or I'll meet you after you're here.)
He's been a humble man, and he's been learning a lot lately.
(Hi) it went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such high office.
Today, I have had a lesson from a lady who is the director of the land economy.
She was very pleased with my work.
Sucking in a jasper behaved well.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of work and cash payments for the hoops.
I'm on Friday.
I don't do only a lot to them, and I sleep to them. (and I drink a lot of water.)
If he's going to the doctor tomorrow, I'm going with you if you can.
I have to get another test.
You don't have to go again.
It's not working well, it's not going well, it's going to have to be a good master.
That's enough.
Can you send me the correct e - mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you are enrolled in.
And children feed there or have to be brought with them?
Now, for a moment, there's one question.
If You Need More Help, Write
If I'm right, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the beginning, we didn't want you to raise money so that people wouldn't think we'd speculate on it!
But for an online fill, I didn't have enough of two items:
Thank you for today's present gift.
That's going to be good because the whole family is going to be painting.
The University of Carazin urges employees and students to check any information carefully, not to trust anonymous sources in Messrs and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Look at official information alone.
So you can count on me, thanks!
My other brother, who's staying in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
Gathered some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we have to have the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
The day I was away from work is a pass.
Staff Summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Literally: “It is not ruled out by the armed forces of the Russian Federation of provocative acts in the territory of the Republic of Moldova, with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring State...
Details: The Adversary continues to create an offensive grouping of troops to act in the Slogodian direction.
Probably the next day, the occupiers will try to recover the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and dispatch personnel, weapons and equipment for fighting in Ukraine.
Weapons and equipment are being trained in the permanent location of the 60th individual Motoshooter Brigade (Monastycher) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably the marked weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to re-establish the special composition of the battalion tactical group of the 36th individual motorcycle crew, the Borza, Zabaikal Region, 29 of the general army of the Eastern Military District is being recruited from within the marked brigade.
There's a special problem with the enemy getting into the positions of drivers and driving mechanics.
The selection of the selected warehouse from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the opposer to disrupt the delivery of cargo to the fighting sites will continue to strike the transport infrastructure in Ukraine to destroy or destroy them.
The determined units of the Belarus Republic of Armed Forces continue to carry out the task of strengthening the Ukrainian-Bilior border in the Brittany and Gomel regions.
In the Slogodian direction, separate units of the 6th general army and the north fleet coast forces continue to block the city of Kharkov, to continue the artillery shelling of certain parts of the city.
An air survey of the area continues in the Islamic direction to detect the positions of the Ukraine Armed Forces.
To that end, the opponent applies BPLA - Orlan-10 -
With force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to strike in the directions of the Long and the Dmitrovk population, and he did not succeed and went into earlier positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the opponents continue to focus their efforts on the control of the population of Popasna, Ruby, Lower and Newbachmouth, as well as on the establishment of full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to storm in the Golden region, and he did not succeed.
The city of Mariupol has continued to storm in areas of Azostal and the seaport by means of artillery and aircraft raids.
Individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shellings on the positions of the Ukrainian forces in the areas of the Highlands, the Work Lover and the Mariana.
In the areas of Donetsko and Luhansk, four enemy attacks, five tanks, eight armoured units, six motor vehicles, and eight enemy artillery systems have been recorded in Ukraine’s last era.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
And if you want to sleep, I'll hold you back.
Are you sure I'm coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see you today, so tell me, I'll get it.)
We didn't watch TV at home and we didn't have 1+1 watching.
I'm just going to turn on the TV just to listen to Czech
I'm running out of a monthly fare package today.
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand, so I can prepare stuff in this area.
I'm going to ask her, and I'm a little ashamed to ask, and she gives us so many pies.
We'll meet my father later, and we'll meet him.
I read a Facebook announcement, but Google must have written something. . . . I think the phone number is enough.
Hello, we've got the things you brought, but are there any things you can bring them to us in 10 min?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is up, I can start work next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the office to file (if you get it, because it's a big turn) and it's raining on Saturday:)
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, and I really liked chemistry school, and I'm learning Czech to know the dream of working on Tavi.
Friends of old, not very much, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends of the spirit and of the mind.
Now you too have had difficult times.
During the last month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from your feet to your head, as has every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed that you feel guilty and ashamed of your country's actions in relation to your neighbors.
Because of what you're giving Ukraine your name.
Some of you activists have long faced a threat, and you have prepared for a decisive blow.
Early in March, I wrote to Alexander Chercasov, my very old friend from “Memorial.”
I'll tell you a little bit later, \"as Sasha usually told me laconically. \" Right after the search, we'll go through the ruins.
Others — active cultures, artists, critics, writers — are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for very few of you — those who worked in “Memorial ” in “New Newspaper ” on“ Echo Moscow ” in “Meduzzy ” organizations of Naval and in a handful of other places — did many of you do anything to counter this regime?
Except to participate in the mitings while they were still there.
Also read a column of Russian journalists: “It's late to hide, it's late to keep quiet.
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are more than abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive sympathy, which must have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart.
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had some freedom and democracy -- messy even bloody, but real.
But the year 1991 didn't turn out to be better than 1917.
Why, whenever you finally have a revolution, you're finally in such a terrible fear of sadness that you're looking for salvation behind the back of the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of taking over and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans in the Staff did, you took a soul to the Derzinski Memorial -- and allowed the KGB to lay low, to recover, to transform and take power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option, and humbled yourself with the robbery.
In 1998 your economy fell, and that marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or for war in Chechnya.
Survival became a major concern.
Then came Putin, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to equal the Cheyenne to the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember well those years.
I was working in Chechnya at the same time, helping the people who were affected by the Putin-anti-terrorist operation, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of the Terrible, Qatar-Jurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends, I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed about the torturers of civilians, about the children killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of their families who had died.
And you said to me: ‘ Brad, we’ve already got tired of your Cheyenne. I remember these words very well.
In reply, I resented: “Others, it's not my Cheyenne, it's your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, to kill your fellow citizens...
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of the zeros, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look at the fact that some of the money stolen will remain in the middle-class pockets.
Many of you have made a good living, some have prospered, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found better jobs.
Prices grew, but was it trouble?
Moscow shined and was full of silk.
When several opponents — Yuri Szkochikhina, Anne Politkowski, Alexander Litvinenko and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over President Medvedeev's position, and sat down as prime minister himself, you, as I can see, hardly paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or refused to speak up.
How many of you did I meet in the next few years on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the foothills of Kazbej or in the café and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it's unlikely that we, in the West, did a lot if we did anything at all.
A bit of indignation, a little bit of sanctions; but what's the significance of Russia's flagrant violation of international law when it's such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
And yet, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, are still awake.
When Putin changed again in places with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went out to protest massively.
Nabal's name became proselyte, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt apprehensive that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
Alternative action was first organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are outside bars.
Some have received enormous terms.
“ And what we could do...
I heard it so often and still hear it.
“ The state is so strong, and we are so weak ”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president, who had fooled their European hopes, they once took Midan -- and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for determined defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures, and hammers of Molotov.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive became Janukovic, and Ukrainians restored democracy, the right to choose and expel leaders on their own if they do their own wrong.
Midan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
So using the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you have been opposed, but there is little benefit in doing so.
How many were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens have maintained annexation.
A new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shed suddenly returned 180 degrees Fahrenheit [180 ° C] and began to admire him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, since we stopped talking immediately thereafter.
The rest of those who remained my friends were largely silent.
“ We don’t care about politics, ” you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks since the restoration, which was started by the mayors of Moscow in 2012 -- with their binbeets, publicly available wyphae, and hipster cafés.
Actually, Donbas is far away, Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You hardly paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever, even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria criticized it at the time in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and myself saw government snipers shooting coldly at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
There were only your soldiers, among all Russian citizens, who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015 with experience for the next serious war.
Certainly, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
“ They came first after the socialists, but I said, ‘ I’m not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I said, \"Because I'm not a union member.
Then they came after the Jews, but I said, “I am not a Jew. ”
Then they came over me, but no one was left to say anything on my behalf.
How many of you spoke of Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority were speaking.
Some are really speaking right now — such as Dmitre Gluhowski, Michael Schishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people are allowed to speak abroad, some of them from within the country, like Marina Oivnnikov, risking getting into a new gulag or making up a company called Naval.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with Ukrainians -- or what seems to be very likely to happen if he doesn't -- he'll take it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but most of the time alone have been protesting and still had a minor period of time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreement in the social media (let it be just a black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were simply given as an anecdote have not been so far away — and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you then?
The example of Ukrainians -- even more than 2014 -- scares the Putin regime -- they prove that it can be combated.
And that reason, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage is on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that war is at all.
But you friends of mine know very well what's going on.
You're reading the environmental news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're communicating with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know where it goes.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your election is just a hohmah, your laws, if you don't mind the repressive ones, cost no more than the paper they're written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is ruined faster than I am writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a ticket abroad, even if there's some flight left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somewhere or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you'll see something else.
Still, there is another.
Which will end up disrupting this regime.
And maybe under the conditions that have come together, you'll need less from you than you think.
Consider this.
The spark won't come from you: the economic collapse that's coming on Russia is likely to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and prices won't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which is you, my friends.
But if every city gets its own place, as it has done on a periodic basis, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
An organization and coordination is needed. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- the Internet, which can be restricted, but which is still running and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Nabal’s organization was crushed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There's a lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If it's over 300,000, it's going to be a shock.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all he got them into Ukraine, all he got them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; but those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be wasted.
Your son will leave a joke in a computer chatroom -- and will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet -- and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and die in a raw cell under police batons.
That's what's been going on for years, and it's only going to get more and more on a bigger and bigger scale.
So you have no choice.
Do it coldly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were on Friday in the class, and we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home at night.
That you see me as a press secretary
age, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant?
I go to a expensive restaurant for dinner once on the jet.
I'll try to explain everything to her)
That's how we liked it, and we wanted something more brilliant, so that's a better choice.
I went to a room where there were lots of people, and I got tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice gone, weakness and head spins
I have to go to that government to work.
We already did that, but we said who registered in April only getting money at the end of the month.
On Thursday we need a pass, and we go to the doctor with our children.
But at night I was written by a lady who liked your job, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for her to get new news, and I'm sure I'm gonna report her.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and effort.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, mental job where I was completely disappointed.
It's a very bad waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, however, I have become involved in one - way love and marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart trouble.
I think people should love, respect, trust each other to create a family.
I haven't met that before.
Good day, where in Yale can you acquire the molds to bake a pack(paper or silicon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm going to put a test on Valya right now.
She's got a D.C. in her lying state, and now her leg's broken in a plaster, a bedridden's wheel, and her food's all shivering in a blender.
Mr. Reiharde, I'm sorry I'm bothering you when you're out of work.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into Natalie's game room tonight, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to see things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our children's room yesterday until 7 p.m.
Can that really be so?
The working hours of the room, by 4:00 p.m.
And ultimately it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a hard time opening the page to a very weak Internet.
Good morning, we're good)
It's most difficult to figure out how to deal with geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Vicky studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for our apartment and wf?
We Thank You so much for Our Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We'll try to maximize the amount by the end of the week to calculate
The situation regarding the Russian invasion is a briefing by the adviser to the Office of President Oleksie Arestovich (10.04.2022).
A adviser to the Chief of Office of the President described the heroic action of an officer in the Marioula border military -- he was surrounded and injured, so he blew himself up with a radio station so she wouldn't get an opponent.
I have a very important question whether I'm going to be able to count my granddaughter for five years (a bronchial asthma ) now she's got a scruples and wheezes...
We need a family doctor to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice is urgent, and we are very concerned about her condition.
We live in the Czech Republic Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor to be there at the Dolní Chabry or somewhere near maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly show was very good.
The butterflies sat on the hands and feet of the children.
