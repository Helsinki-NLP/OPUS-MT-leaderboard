Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in its amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Tymoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes for ratification.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar al-Qadhafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and without him the war is over.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists generally prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the usual Shariat law, which we have already heard about.
Libya would become a crime-free country because the punishment for theft was hand-off.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
The Koran will unite society of rival clans in place of the dictator.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would not like.
Whatever the case, our way of life is neither the only one of our kind nor the best and is likely not to reach the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have received help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that they believe that NATO was not ruled by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not in their numbers.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were removed from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, should not be concerned about the expulsion of the crusaders.
While the oil companies will receive black gold from Libya without occupation, will they not be valued?
And then the West will finally be able to enjoy the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the Shariat followers put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm struck Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries made public data on GDP in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stalemate, Germany and France were showing growth.
Still, the debt market is running high today.
Investors have looked not only towards Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Statistical Offices of Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries made their preliminary economic development assessments public in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by 0.5% expected; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, where Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the original information was stagnant).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a provisional growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in stagnant state, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than those predicted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a provisional growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stalemate over the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which is the same as the projections of analysts.
The Greek economy has shown a preliminary 5.2 per cent decrease.
Its 10-year bond income is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return on Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last creditor to save the situation.
The Chechia Congregation was selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 bill and celebrate an unexpected 200 million monetary prize.
The National Team has successfully met the most challenging task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chech and Peter Yirakaek's beautiful goal, they won at 1:0.
In the second secret of the Czech team, she was happy to retain a significant advantage after the domestic response, and she would again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the match and provided a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and a great deal of luck in the second.
Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Chech; and the heroic Yirakek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the Exodus to the Champion of Europe.
The excellent defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianović and Vouchenic became the most unsuccessful match couple after they missed two great opportunities.
The great Petr Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Champion next year, and the Czech football will make about 200 million Czech kroner.
Since the first few minutes, the game has been very tense.
Both teams had difficulty holding combinations, and the game went to the center of the field for the most part.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the host team in the first time; long strikes for the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ' s nuclear program.
They created a shield of life.
Several hundred university students have set up a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They thus wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, prayers from students prior to entering the building were followed by prayers for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that all showed that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the student prayers prior to the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a mollusc about the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives will be, according to the Israeli press, the installations in both Isfahan and Nathanze, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Eating for obese children: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more; while 9 per cent of school children are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we see the importance of environment and patterns of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on tablets of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children with obesity ate free potatoes on the eve of an education event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of today ' s school - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents are finding time to participate in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year and was attended by nearly 900 elementary students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident during the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Vsheobecná zdravotní pojiš-ovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils have joined the project in grades 4 to 8.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports burden are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children suffering from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of those polled said that they ate five times a day, with breakfast lunch and snack dinner, and that’s one of the unpremovable conditions of good eating,” says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch or sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families get breakfast together.
In most families, everyone's breakfast alone.
The worst opening is that in every tenth family, people don't have breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study found that roasted foods are more commonly used in homes with children who are obese.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet chilly drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children engage in regular sports, more than twice the number is reduced to 15 per cent when it comes to parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“Evidence in the food of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age is far from the ideal of healthy nutrition”
Their favorite food includes lots of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet-flavored drinks — the final part of the study.
As the main lunch meal, the paste beat the bird with a slight overhang.
Children, however, showed little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
yearning for a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided they were provided with relevant information.
Many of the participants in the control group in the study showed a significant shift in diet preferences when they completed the questionnaire after completion of the exercise Obesity - this is not an accident - is referred to in the outcome of the project.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet-flavored drinks, more children were told to drink just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children were more likely to observe birds and fish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and baking.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the pros and cons.
In the first article on stylist training, I went to see the amount of information I had in the introductory exercises.
I had no idea what would happen next.
The lectures of the three experts in this area; clothing choices councils for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
There's more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical assignments we are expected to have.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is filled with information.
This time, with Alenca, the director, (there is no man at all), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
In one short neck, another of the boys ’ figures without proper shape, another weighs more.
The stylist should know how to dramatically reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add the missing volumes.
We have been advised how to emphasize the presence of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have a more magnificent breast and thigh and narrow waist, and not to wear them too much.
For example, if the difference between waist and thigh levels is so large that it is not possible to pick a coat or pants, you should have at least one item on your order.
You're clearly not going to regret the money you put in, because perfectly sitting clothes are priceless.
In an errand, you're going to feel much better than the one you're always going to roll in, expose your waist, etc.
The possessors of the boy's figures may, on the other hand, wear clothing with rustles, applicating, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to come up with two sets for any celebrity: a day and a night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress and shape.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much simpler to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who's recently turned to a ton. (Please think I'm exaggerating) or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes from magazines or find them online, print and process them through graphic programs.
Mudboard is what we call the result of the work, then it reflects our own style and attitude towards the graphic image.
It is important to keep a graphical style in mind.
A stylist not only dresses real people but creates food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions such as fashionable bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Comenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
A Stylist Needs General Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the type of figures, was revived by three professional guests in this field.
Stilist, Honza Poconna; fashionable designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashionable photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminds us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist must make use of this fact.
A good stylist can use one garment in a different way.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-train can be worn normally, over jeans and T-shirts like coats; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without curtains like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll a sleeve or lift a collar, and the whole image is completely changed.
- Play with him, he stressed.
In any case, I most appreciated the following advice: “For your work, you must perfectly know the rules.”
Then you can start breaking them,\" said Jacob to us.
Here I finally realized why we're going to be bitten by definitions and rules, what to combine with and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist has to have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
Thus, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten orders), I should be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that a painting often looks and works in conjunction with others quite different from reality.
We have to have that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Poconna confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing eye, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The treatment of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think it's redundant (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something and what they look like is a second time).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size than the one they really carry.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids were writing anything about something that's famous for sweatsteel/stupid, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to deal with the fashion and be able to pick up the items.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
In order to be able to evaluate people, not to condone them, or to hold on to their opinions.
- If the manager asks you to look through her clothes and add some nice things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, told her that her clothes are horrible -
“ Find at least a few things you can commend, and tell them you can wear along with them, ” says Mario.
He also showed us that a working bag should be specifically placed.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
Besides obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller or an English pin, it should have a nylon thread (the stylists use it to photograph certain items, such as bags or hats), special clippings to bind the fabric on the back in case the clothing is too large (boobs and similar items are prohibited because they port their clothes) or a sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and to gain some practical experience, we learned how to make proper overlays on the soles of the shoes.
Even in a studio where the floors are smooth, the floors can be damaged -- let alone street surveys.
And here we go with a stick.
You don't have to touch shoes with scissors so you don't spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario commended my work.
Those skills didn't fit in with me.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist is not easy, no matter what they say.
V Needs for Speed: The run is in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning job trip because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were somewhat satisfied, but that was not important because no one clearly wanted to do an extra job.
Before getting out of the new version with the subheadings, there were great hopes.
It was expected that she would push the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the race game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression has been a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series of games for several years.
That means, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an inexplicable lenience of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story whose main character, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You're in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
There's a few interesting things about this.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race follows its own route, and separate stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no sense that there's always the same thing going on in the game.
Despite the fact that the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
Still, the game does not produce strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or in the snowy mountains, it is a pleasure.
Besides, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the wilderness, you fall into a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, mountains need to be careful not to fall into an avalanche.
Individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you've been trying to chase several rivals (usually a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (the standard race with a timer); or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you face the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just interactive animation, where most of the time Jack is running away from somebody and you have to help him by pressing the buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
While it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you might expect (only three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that for a game, it's good because it's a property that doesn't bother; given all of the foregoing, it's one of the things that make a game more fun.
The race model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it is not considered to be a disadvantage.
If you're looking for real-life simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Yet, this driving model is very good for dynamic races, although better market options can be found.
So far, it's very good.
But after a while, problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
You don't expect you to have a difficult game of change and collision, but if you don't have any idea what you're going to do before you hit an object, how your car will behave, something's wrong.
Usually by passing or passing by cars in a tight stream, you sometimes touch a different car slightly, but sometimes in a very similar situation, your car starts to unwind.
Or the drowsy's broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to spoil fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break or walk away from the track, the game will take you back to the point where it stopped.
However, for each race, only five restarts are available.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a certain part of the race.
An important disadvantage of playing is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For example, some turns need to take place in a certain way, otherwise you just won't like it.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're there, the cars are already in position that you need either to drive or drop their speed.
It doesn't matter when you get close to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's going in front of you, he's making you worse by looking at one or more of the accidents in this area.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get irritated.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving pattern, the game is occupied and sometimes so saturated with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter if you don't miss a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during racing is unusual.
You need to track the plugs along the way, because it's where your car can change, even though in most cases the one you already have is good enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are good for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, along curved mountain tracks.
The master mode is closely linked to the mode of the chatenge mode; it is the race for individual sections that you will find out about the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and glasses, common to challenges and story regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players and communicates with the public.
Here's another disadvantage that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in order.
You and your car will fall into the metro tunnel (let's think so) where you're riding on the rails in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's think so) when suddenly a subway train hits you at your back, turning your car into a scrap metal chest.
For a few days, we discussed whether, in fact, no one thought for a second during the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we're so mad.
Technically composed games are nothing special; but the overall impression of the video network is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
While it is regrettable that, in some critical contexts, the quality of the record is sometimes quite weak,
This is especially true of large numbers of participants, where good recording is not particularly helpful either.
The sound is fine; the sound is good for the lover.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack \"have compositions of different styles\"; but it is unlikely that many people will buy games because of their music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: Run was rather disorderly.
If the game were to run away from clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Run is the best part of NFS over the past few years.
Whatever the case, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but prepare for the flaws to blind you as a searchlight for the airport.

Ambassador Vizinov to the EU:
Czechs have a reputation for non-negotiators and skeptics in relation to the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreement between the individual organizations”
- I didn't expect such a terrible war to happen -
It will take five or six years before things get stabilized, calm and all players get used to their new roles, the EU Ambassador Milena Vizenov has taken a hard course in the Faculty of Law.
She showed how she followed her motto - clearly and openly about Europe - in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and relations between them so easily and clearly that many of the speakers from the KU Faculty of Law would have been jealous.
Moreover, Vizenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
“The critics had said that he was an ordinary gray office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he was able to play his part...
- He's a person who can listen to and communicate with twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, and who has a clear idea of what kind of country the EU needs to develop.
She explained her new position as representative of international relations and security issues as the answer to the question: “Who is the European Union? by what number do I need to call; i.e., as an important step towards harmonization and greater transparency of the Union’s policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
The evaluation continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
It called the successful Czech presidency the past year.
The Czechs dealt with the impending financial crisis; they addressed the crisis and organized an East Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic is currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the current backlog.
In addition, a new EU seven-year budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, what areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and less; all of those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: “O Europe, the understandable language,
- I really don't like cuts, foreign words, and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that people in Brussels aren't trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheese.
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs into European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe — Our Future
The Ambassador claims that Czechs are considered euro-skeptics, as well as people who point to negative rather than positive things.
She wants more Czechs to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are at fault: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
- Trust me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and I join a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, \"Hey, what's the matter with the assembly, again, the Viszegrad Group?' and he's not happy about it.\"
In the future, the Vicinov Union expects mainly new strict rules for budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea to be two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
- We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone.
- We have the Shengen Zone, and we already have a strong cooperation institute.
♪ For the first time it was said that countries that wanted to join together, whereas those that didn't want to, could stay away ♪
The number of such institutions will grow; it will truly be two-speed Europe waiting for Vizenov.
In that regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM's novice enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the best word to express an IMB strategy, the closest one will probably be -- long-lasting --
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; it is considered very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's long-term record was laid by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, senior.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan — Think — thus became a stamp surrounding the life of the future giant (and also the title of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
- For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more, says Samuel J. Palmizano, current leader of the Jubilee.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way as Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms and a complex bonus system for better inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is similarly advanced.
It was one of the world's first companies to eliminate all the discrimination that gave it a great choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that the woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is now Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations occur.
It's no surprise that there's a lot of ideas -- about half a million people working in the company.
A good reputation organization
The firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by strong internal and external imagery.
From the very beginning, from the point of view of the concept of IBM, rather than a technology company, said to the economist Professor at Harvard Business School and the author of the IBM book Rosabet Moss Kanter.
-IBM is not a technology company, it's a technology business company - it's Joj Kolani from Forrester Research.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between going into and creating a market.
In one hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company, which is developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her staff won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With 220 billion dollars, market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (the first place in Apple) pummeling Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products came from customers' tastes and came into the age, for example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service; and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by the forward movement, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM can easily lay the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it won't.
This is different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's main revenue comes from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990 it was half as small as it was, it was the largest equipment-producing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth 15 billion dollars, and at the same time invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems IBM has not been harmed by the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the share price of IBM has increased to a record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have been constantly rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except your own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis strikes, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
The history of IBM is from a cheese knife to a space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago. Its original title, \"Corporation of Calculations, Tabulations, Records\" was quite complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally referred to as the brand used for the offices of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid down by a merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as legendary, life-saving hours -- that is, hours fixed when staff members come and leave their jobs.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also presided over the Board of Trustees of the company.
Flint hired the director of the contractor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The manager then pushed the founder of IBM into a shadow — Watson’s ideas remain the foundation of an unbreakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from its name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from raw knives and meats to cashiers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company into all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later, his son Thomas Watson Jr. took his seat in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM had begun to develop artificial intelligence technologies and had created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - to fly a human to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to the Chinese company Lenovo while buying PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting office, thus focusing entirely on high-value consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smart Planet concept.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technology in areas not yet planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented the Smart House platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The traditions of IBM are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in central and eastern Europe simultaneously, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates the Strategic Outsourcing Centre at Brno.
Central and Eastern European headquarters is located in Prague, where there is also a world-level research group concerned with the recognition of speech.
Richtarzev of his faithless husband:
Ivet, leave him to me, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtargev (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtrange (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
- He might come home, but not as my partner, he explained to Richtarjov.
When Darina Richtarjov provided the blood of Bartoshova in her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Evetus to leave Rzychan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave his singer.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to be reconciled to her husband's novel; and now she was finally forgiving him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if one day Richtarge and Bartoshov were to part, his wife would not accept him with open arms.
He's my sons' biological father, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna drive him out.
One day he'll finish his days not as my favorite, lost, and found old fool, and the man with whom I'm bound said to Richtargev, adding that she's already released from her husband and insists only on a two-way basis.
As long as Joseph has nothing against what his wife rejected.
♪ I respect my wife's decision ♪
- I'm going to be with Iveta, I'm not going to change that.
- My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect the decision -
- Our union is still in operation; I'm in charge of repair, garden, house and skipping.
\"Darina and I communicate perfectly, but we don't share the bed anymore.\" Richtarg of the Blesk magazine said.
He claims that if Richtargev finds new love, he won't interfere.
- We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has, and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Yvette, and I'm in full responsibility, Joseph.
Women's bad habits: Do they bother you?
When you ask men to identify some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing several women's habits that make men angry?
Chopping
Your other half complains you always go shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at big sales?
If so, your skipping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for walking in some way.
And yet, who of you would refuse to walk around the clothes store looking for perfectly seated clothes and putting them in fancy colors?
Maybe it's a hobby for most women, but for men it's going to be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Enduring Dissatisfaction
- I'm too fat.
- I'm going to have to drop at least five kilograms - maybe I'm going to start making gymnastics -
- You're still pulling on to me -
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are involved in their appearance.
It's not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men literally have allergies to your partner's constant complaints.
Strong gender also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women are annoyed.
Most Important of Order and Cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Moiste glass, vacuum cleaner, floor wash, dust resistance, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on a clean cafel in dirty shoes, children for dirt in a clean sink, and fingerprints on a window pane in a living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this — rejection — try to realize that it is not wise to go to extremes, and that your family should not be in the first place in order and cleanness.
An innocent desire for cleanness can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
Incentive to second
♪ Drop the fuck in the basket ♪
- You're gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow.
“Sweet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor.”
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he might find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Splashes
Some women like to gossip, insult, and gossip against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, who, who, who, how and why.
From time to time, each of us is likely to let go of gossip.
Let's be honest, that's what all women seem to be.
In any event, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in the female labour force, pose a great danger to their surroundings.
The resulting transfers of Jagra and Voracek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL's Monday match, two successful handouts of the Hawket striker Jaromire helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Carolina's ice, again becoming the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Girru drew on the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player in the match.
Two successful handovers of the match were also owned by the player on the same team with Jagro Yakub Vorakek.
After the match, Jagra told foreign journalists that he had predicted Gir to have a great night.
- I told him before the match he'd kill a hat-trick.
- I felt it -
“Sometimes you feel things like that ” explained the Jargre, after whose actions Girra scored a goal at the first opportunity that Flaires had given.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a Czech follow-up -
The closing Harricaines Warak has taken over the highway and handed it to Maxima Talbota, who has killed between the circles.
One second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer, a home player, reduced the gap by a number of advantages, but Flyers was brought back at the beginning of the second time.
Especially Giro.
After his presentation, Jagra scored a third goal; then his blow was transformed into Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
♪ I like playing with him ♪
- I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely entering the top three.
- I never thought at the end of my career I'd be playing with a hockey player like him.
- It makes me happy -
- I want to support him -
My teammates tried to help me all these years at the NHL, and now my turn came, added the jagro.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruut and the Dwyer toolbar, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
- Pronger was doing great in our zone.
- He hit the gang, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far edge.
- I was aiming at him and I'm glad it worked - I've described Warak's impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory led Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
The Protector of the Montreal Czech Jaroslav Spakek team did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to upper body injury.
With an experienced defender, Canadiens lost his two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of toolbars.
Tomasz Plékanets was unable to kill during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the home coach was overwhelmed by a large number of back-trip injuries, as the match ended with only five defenders.
- The situation is bad -
“We ended the match with just one experienced player, the rest were young ...
“ Whatever the case, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
- The replacement was amazing and we couldn't resist -
- We had to simplify the game, move the devil out of our zone.
♪ What was our weak side ♪ added P.K.Subban's defender ♪
After thirty attacks, Onjay Pavets' Czech needle player helped Winnipegs win Tampa Bay 5:2.
Golly Jets, who interrupted the five-mother series of beatings, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government tourist agencies were able to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Çedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies of the time mostly sold to countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on vacation, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, with significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits on socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakian national wanted to travel by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was necessary from that country; otherwise an individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies were offering trips to the West, but you had to either take turns all night, have a sleeping bag, or have nice friends in the agency.
And that was not all.
The money was needed to travel to the West and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit, it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) to travel to the West.
The most common practice for the Czechs was their home leave, which has resulted in large numbers of cottages and summer homes, and this continues to be the custom.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus undergone a real revolution.
While before 1989 GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations worldwide.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989 we were not free to visit Croatia's most popular now, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain visas for neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, beginning a huge wave of short journeys, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
In Paris, for example, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring in its own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and after a decade, our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has made it possible for travel agencies to prepare regular flights by chartered airlines, which, compared to the past, have now become incredibly cheap because of the ability to order flat discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys even easier.
The following significant event in the post-revolution period occurred in 2000, with great demand leading to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and these winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent along twelve exotic tracks.
Currently, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another major event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, and my country has thus forever joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in 2008 Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person during leave abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general assembly must choose the president, the threat of the pat comes back.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that Ivan Gashek's successor, the head of the Czech football association, would not be named after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There remains no agreement on what rules of the election to follow.
Without that, no ballot will begin for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomas Paclik are eager to lead a Czech football.
When he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era again plunged football into the dispute between the two houses of association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
It became quite apparent on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Members of the general assembly of the stars came to the National House in Prague, Smykhov, as the talks remained blocked, not only by the electoral process.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly, only legal representatives or also officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that the representation based on the credentials is not possible.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board is also not too helpful, although at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, it is mostly concerned with this issue.
There have been several changes in the way of voting, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how do you move on to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
The argument is whether to follow established standards or to find another model, says one of the Vice-Presidents of the FAAR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the administration of the association.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received much support from the House from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to accept the compromise — to count the winner of the candidate ' s election with the greatest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in the total percentage ratio, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
At the same time, the previous two rounds would have lost their sense; they would have totally rejected the concept of the two Houses -- Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments; he said that it would be better not to change the rules and to vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Suddenly, Tomas Pazlik concurs with his opinion, although the election rules, as defined by the statute, are estimated to be more than that of other candidates.
- I would like the election to go as far as possible -
“I want to avoid all representative foolishness, as in the previous general assembly,” says Victoria Plzeny, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he was largely at odds with Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburka; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
- All emotional armour will calm down after today ' s expected graduation at the Champion of Europe -
“Futball will be happy again, and people will be more willing to cooperate,” says the representative of Apple, of the three candidates who have the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl's more withhold.
- I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous -
“It is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
- It could cause another breakdown of the general assembly -
- I hope the common sense will win, says Reichl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some, individual talks have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered to Podgorica by Vice-President Dabilir Kucher and Reichla, was not to leave Prague in the morning due to technical inadequacies, and an alternative was made to take part of the executive committee to the event of a replay.
Finally, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, can become crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobes, would like the opponents of the most powerful sports association in the country to agree.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the credit capacity of football; and the planned general assembly ÇSTV with the new Czech sport directive following Sazka's financial problems.
Pazlik is in the presidential struggle because he can't see a suitable candidate.
If, prior to the extraordinary general assembly, the head of football player Phlesen Tomas Paclik would have seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements for President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not have even applied for a high post.
If there was a decent candidate, I would fight for him and not fight myself.
\"But they haven't found this man yet,\" said Pazlik ÇTK.
Pazlik's motive for entering the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindjikh Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favorite of elections, from entering the leadership of FAčR.
Moreover, he emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be filled by an experienced top manager who is not too involved with football.
♪ I spoke to a few people who could be thought of ♪
♪ For me it was terrible to hear some of them say that at this point they didn't even want to be involved in Czech football ♪
- I'd like to change that, he said.
Pazlik's main disagreement with Pelta is now related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbro, president of the Plzen regional football association, and Berbr is a man of conflicting reputation who, behind the scenes, is known as a powerful lobbyist who is able to influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Pazlik thus considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
- If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward -
With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football, says Paclik.
He hints at the fact that Pelta's name was recorded a few years ago during the telephone audit of the corruption case; Pelte was able to avoid a sentence.
- I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring to football.
And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA, says Patzlik, and now he doesn't mention his previous statement that he's going to sell the Plzeny Club if Pelta becomes President?
If Pazlik wins Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the general assembly in September, which ended with a fiasco.
He would be the first person to whom I would turn,
\"He's very capable.\"
- I can introduce him at the head of the assembly.
- But he can't run the association -
\"I don't get my nose in anything I don't know,\" said Pazlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judiciary led by Human Machela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pazlik claims he'll risk running the association.
He refers to his experience of running private companies; from last summer, he ran a team of Plzeny who, with his help, celebrated his first triumph in the league in May.
- I have the power to make the soccer environment change, to support its changes for the better.
To limit the influence of certain groups of people who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to abhorrent situations, says Pazlik: He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Sparta’s director, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose assistance it will lobby at the highest political level for the allocation of more money for lottery sports.
- This is one of the key points that the new President should be dealing with -
“If taxes are taxed on gambling as claimed by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they have to make it clear where the money goes,” he said.
Pazlik does not consider his connection to the Plzeny Brack Club, although he argues that President FAčR should be independent.
Pelt's connected to the Apple, and Reichl to Prague Duckle.
- It's not perfect -
\"And yet I don't see sense in the hypocritical handover of my shares of the Plzeen Club to someone else, as I'm going to come back in six months,\" says Pazlik.
Pelta promised new rules to FACHR that would avoid the Election Pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FAAR rules to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Before the talks on Thursday in Nimburk, Apple's function remains an optimist and believes that attention from the pre-election struggle will draw back today's expected success in our football collection.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to vote at the last moment before the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could therefore be useful to protect his ideas about football in a broader context.
People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday.
- They feel it's time for someone to lead an association - they claim a man, mostly associated with the Jablonze Club, but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is sufficiently experienced to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria of Ivan Gashek’s reign.
“Unhappily, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June ”
“If there were no different modes of representation, we would have had a president since September,” he said.
He referred to the rewriting of the key instrument of civil association as a false target for delegates.
- If I become president, I'm going to consider it my personal task, and I'm going to take on a personal responsibility if this attempt fails--
- It's a fundamental question without which we can't exist.
In addition, he says he's not trying to identify himself against rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Reich, whom he valued for his legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his candidate was to be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Patslick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
- He's been in football for over a year, and he's been a success.
“However, his attacks were inconceivable, and many people were surprised by the methods of his campaign campaign —
Some of them now question his true identity, said Pelt of their competition, and he claims to be true to the declarations he declared in September.
He considers his main weapon of soccer knowledge, from competition at the lowest level to national gathering.
The National Assembly must represent all football.
- I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the consequences of last year's corrupt scandal -
- Right after that, I would focus on both private and public sector negotiations to guarantee enough money for all football - a 40-year-old candidate said CHTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football manager would not result in the dismissal of staff.
- I'm going to need to get to know the official instructions of the individual staff - It was his message to Insurance, where the extended period of interstitiality is a very understandable nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that the delegates would come to Nimburk on Thursday would not be in vain.
- If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with that.
“Foutball needs the trust he can gain by selecting his leader at last,” says Pelt, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that his leadership, FACHR, will start active
If, at the meeting on Thursday Yindrich Reich, the current Vice-President, becomes President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will, in a hearing, be displeased.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, there will be time for hard work.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for selected areas of football.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money from football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
- As President, I'd like to focus on football in general -
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national gatherings, professional football and football events for young people . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I don't mean to say I'm gonna do it myself, I told Reichl in my interview for TK.
- I am a team player, and I want to assign authority to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area -
♪ I'm going to set the tasks carefully so that in each of these segments, football can take a big step forward ♪
- It's probably not going to be good for many people, because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticizing others, but adding.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to question his candidacy.
- I know I work 20 hours a day -
\"But I need to know if there's any meaning in that, and that I'm not going to be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step -- he explained his doubts.
- But many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come -
- That's the confidence I can't give up, he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
- More work was done in those two years, and I don't want to cut it all off -
♪ There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them ♪ he said in fear that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could go back to what was before Gashek.
- I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that's unlikely to be competent by Mirek Pelta.
- He's surrounded by people who would do football so that it's only available for the chosen--
- I can't blame you much, but I'm definitely not subjective.
♪ I'm trying to be objective ♪
- I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a select minority,' says Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the allegations that he will be the only President of the Czech Republic.
♪ Although many people try to say the opposite, I plan to make the most of Moravia ♪
“For example, the time has come to reflect on the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue the struggle in the first league.”
“It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia,” said Reichl.
While the manager of the Plse Tomas Paclik Club joined the presidential struggle, Reichl is not bold about assessing his chances of winning.
“I still feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress,” said Reichl, who has been successful in saving tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiating television contracts, and negotiating a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was - excluded from the process of returning credit capacity to Czech football - he considers another rival, Pazlik, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
- No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plsen this year.
- If he is elected, I hope he will continue with what he started, Ivan Gashek, without significant staff changes in the committees.
He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit, he told Reichl about his rival.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Basins
Jump Into the Water
Julia Stanek
The children's swimming pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest, which can test Europe's incredible water, and relax the rest of the body in the jacuz after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't afford to go through his research trips for the last 18 months: without his bathing suit.
The bed on her back in the water, she looked up at the tasted domes, sailed to the marble cherubim waiting for it at the edge of the basin, and loved the carefully renovated swimming pools in the style of the archno.
She was quick to add each pleasant pool to her notebook, with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The historian of the Meder architecture inspected more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered impressions in her recently published book, Badfreuden, the Bathy Gardens, all from the Munich public basins to the historic bathrooms in the Black Forest and the functional concrete buildings in the Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland and one town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real bath culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but everything is different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that users of the voyage must tolerate the blue caffeinated tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe in the voracious smell of the icy forests or listen to the happy chirping of the birds in the park.
- So I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so horrible, says a Vene Meder.
- So I started collecting beautiful pools.
When the surface doubles the architecture
The swimming in the pool and the oils found in the sauna are a healthy factor in the baths so significant, because Meder feels that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take on such work.
- The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building -
High ceilings, colour tiles, and tramps are clearly reflected.
A 190 - page illustrated publication of The Joys of Bathing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health and makes you want to jump into the water.
A water collector named Meder found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
It found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Mishkalz-Tapole Cave) and a thermal bath filled with pulverized water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasber), as well as excellent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Secheni bath in Budapest.
From the many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see the whole Zurich on the rooftop, or you can look at the snowy Eagleberg from the open basin in St. Antonio, and there's a window in the steamer that allows you to see what's happening on a ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits merchants in Langenfeld, but the Etztal Aqua Council looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open shellfish, which appears to be tiny in the background of the Etztal Mountains, are rising.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder basin collector did not smell chlorine in every pool.
Many of the thermal baths smell like a gray one, and the Arpad's name at Beckescrib smells like oil so much that it might be hard for you to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The smell is produced by hydrocarbonates in the pulverized water, which is almost black from the lye that sticks to the skin as soon as you plunge into a pool, which is a kind of healing experience.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing sites, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugachevics, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The baths designed by architect Dushan Jurkovitch in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the viewable windows of a red and yellow building in the style of an ar - novo, she saw weeds growing between the cafel tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped was in the hot trails, an amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Door of Thermal Water in Bad Wildbad.
The basins have already been constructed in three stages: you will find not only the Neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Alhambra-style hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Terminal Palace, the beloved swimming pool of Iris Meder basins, is not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
- That's the skill of combining these different architectural styles, says Meder.
Going to a heat pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to amend in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans feel that it is unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were found in a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistics, Forsa, by the Organization of Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Schumann, demonstrates that the world commodity exchange rates raise prices, and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
Consumers' campaigns are directed directly against Head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are also traded.
Initially, the rates on goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that the players have given up supply and demand rules and are at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism by promising to investigate charges and claiming that no trade is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Tilo Bode was happy with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector.
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
- The Bank has to remove all the investments that make money to the food prices from the portfolio. - Bode said.
- It doesn't matter whether it's hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation.
Akkermann's quick reaction is startling, but the director would like to have an irrefutable image just a few months before he ends his office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also has little or no need to care for expenses - the consequences will have to do with his successor.
Each other would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, the study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make a price rate for food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps to find that their bank is involved in such a trade; according to the study, each other would disclose deposits that eventually lead to speculation of the goods.
43 per cent recommended withdrawal from the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
The home of the 21st century in Vienna
The pavilion is in the new location.
Ingeborg Winsowski
Architectural history with takedowns, falls, and happy ends: Austria’s pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition won prizes in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, empty and abandoned.
Now it's re-opened as a exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glassed hills, which were bold, expressing faith in technological progress.
Pavilion Schwanzera won the 1958 Grand Pr in architecture for his light, sparing steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he was glorified throughout the world in 1973 by his legendary four - cylinder BMW tower and her sister, a cup - shaped building.
Pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near Vienna South Station, transformed and opened as a 20th century museum in 1962, often referred to as “House of the 20th Century” for this reason.
In any event, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons; there were no walls where works of art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001 and its condition had been worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as the Museum of Modern Art.
This museum is a section of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night, in every sense a happy occasion.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslain Arco, a graduate of the Art History School with a brilliant figureie career in youth, who worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Salzburg Modern Museum, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to include a permanent exhibition of Fritz Worruba Foundation, a coffee shop and a bookstore along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of & limited budget
Krishnaitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Cecilation Josef Albrih, and won the competition, but he also attended Schwanzer at the University of Vienna of Technology, and the pavilion was an exceptional place for him -- where he attended the exhibition -- almost every week --
He knew the original design and the tasks that were in front of the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose in the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was the absorber of energy, says Krishanitz.
The windows on the glass façade were replaced, a safety glass was inserted, and a high-quality safety glass was replaced by a glass roof.
The steel translations of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, the inflated light well between the building and the street provides lighting, a virtually new building, but still an elaborate Schwanzera pavilion.
The original outer doors were kept, and the building was painted in an old red brown colour to protect against corrosion.
Hall of cinema is the same as it was before.
All of this is under strict control of the museum office and with limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum office,” says Krishnaitz, pointing to an uneven mound in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, challenges and transformations.
Krishanitz recently observed that pavilion - from Brussels - was a rough - typical story - a capley in town -
Such an architecture is always out of place -- and yet it wants to stimulate real awareness --
The 21st century is in a very correct place, because the city's planning has had a sudden success, and the fully restructured capital of the main station has been growing around the Swiss Garden with offices and residential property.
The home of the 21st century may be complemented by the second building, the collector Francesek von Habsburg, who has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city to be located next door to the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn Plans a multi-million-million-million-year winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn launched an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of staff has to double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the paper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and late trains.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the newspaper Bild reports that by 2015, a total of about 300 million euros is planned for investment.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged staff involved in snow cleaning from paths and platforms will double, to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before starting work and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains in the winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger transport because it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains were awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the flow of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check much more frequently over the years the ICE train axis after one of the ICE trains broke down at the main train station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds of fine in the United States
The new troubles followed the unrest surrounding Josef Akkermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatening a fine in the United States for millions of pounds.
It's like Deutsche Bank has had little trouble in the home, and the past industrial giant in the U.S. has now pushed him, and Deutsche Bank, with headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm down the disputes that arose after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged credit unions down.
- We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties to the court. - The representative of Deutsche Bank in New York said.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for losses arising from billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a case in summer against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtable mortgage bonds are so-called securities, secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed up by internal loans.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 a bubble broke in the real estate market in the United States.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long life in September 2008 in the face of a financial crisis.
Some years later, banks in the United States are still fighting a storm.
Investors and regulators have submitted a large number of claims, seeking compensation or penalties for fraud.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has been behind the largest claim wave.
It blames 18 of the largest international banks for purchasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bond agreements of around $200 billion from American credit organizations.
Deutsche Bank is also at risk of prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements worth 14.2 billion dollars between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator demands that the bank with headquarters in Frankfurt take responsibility for significant losses, but not yet provide an accurate amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet is putting 10 billion in IBM
The Buffet financial guru is actively investing in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, Warren Buffet, the largest American investor, has always stated that he is not investing in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment was seen as a knight's move.
IBM, a veteran of IT, now got the title Sir IBM --
In an interview with CNBC, Boffett, an American business television station, reported that he had purchased IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known much about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that had succeeded even during the financial crisis.
- They've done a lot of work. - Buffet said, with management strategy in mind.
For a considerable time, IBM focused on high-income IT services such as date centres.
The foundation of the computer industry, which is now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far Buffet has avoided technology companies.
He claimed to only invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the manufacture of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of his own subsidiary companies.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company called Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the world's most expensive companies.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
made him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct in the making of money brought him the nickname Oracle of Omaha.
The share price of IBM rose by one percent before opening markets after the Buffet investment announcements.
The Blue Giant, called IBM, stands on the stock exchange for over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Imminent danger
After the identification of the Tswickau, the Turkish media began to question the authority of the German law.
One of the papers says \"blood ideology\" -- which is now rising again to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right of extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this report in Turkey and in the German German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-forgotten fears, and such right-of-way attacks against Turks have not occurred since the fires in Mellav in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There had never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-of-the-way network now discovered is of a scale that is not yet fully understood.
The rise of blood ideology was a headline in the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-of-extreme swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, mentioning victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Berlin Turkish community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a holiday. “The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary is a title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal, Haber X, a commental circumstance in a series of murders.
The German Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
- It doesn't smell well - it's the name of the column Achmet Külahji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their jobs had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and subsequent successful raids were severely criticized by the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before about following suspicious individuals in right-of-way circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric.
- That'll be the best self-defence.
- Peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network is opened and on the rightness of punishment - - written by Selen -
The crimes in Mellena and Zolingen during the 1990s were an example of a world in Germany threatened.
A photograph of the burning ruins in Zolingen was well recorded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event showed the Turks living here so clearly that they were in danger and the Germans were in danger that mistrust and indifference could lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past errors
During that period, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Mellagna.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after setting fire in Zolingen, but attended a memorial ceremony in Cologne, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, in his speech, calculated the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's determined a person's worth by the taxes he pays.
Current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German State has deepened since.
Clearly, what must be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-of-way terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal in Zurich Lake
Most of the leading risky policies of banks in Europe are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely solved itself during the financial crisis and has since dealt with one crisis at a time and again.
Now the German has to get him back on the right track.
Alex Weber certainly didn't suspect that he was going to play that role.
In July, after his effective resignation from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin at least an effective position, the President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was very happy, commended Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for the renewed strength and made some friendly comments to his future colleagues.
♪ UBS managed to make a difference ♪
- I look forward to working with Caspar Philiger and Oswald Grubel.
But it became clear in September that everything was going to be different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about €1.7 billion.
The executive director of UBS, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been regarded as ill, and everyone wants to know when Alex Weber will finally take office?
Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, it will take over the presidency of the Board in May rather than 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist at the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will certainly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the title — the largest banking scandal in Europe —
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it managed the world's largest assets -- and on the other, it won't get out of scandals.
The proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of the hidden and sustainable, but also the fishing asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus managing more viable clients than any other bank in the world,
and entered the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and professor of banking, longtime professor at the Zurich University Banking Institute, explains: “I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank.”
- Knowing what we know now, you might ask me how I could have made so many mistakes.
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that something went wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffley, executive director, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to cope with the crisis.
The Bank has indeed found investors -- but investors -- whose services many bankers have recently politely refused -- one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden in such a way that even its name has not been announced.
It was just the first shot.
It got much worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses and the chairman of the Board of Directors of Marcel Ospel, the second highest salary, resigned from the Chair of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006.
A disaster struck in October 2008 owing to a lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank had bought UBS toxic securities for an untitled number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation had paid 6 billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond to become a co-owner of the bank.
Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of huge banks in a small country.
After all, the UBS balance in 2007 was five times higher than all Swiss production (see schedule).
- We can't save UBS the second time - says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS copied the UBS into a U.S. tax dispute and said that it was ready to hand over data to wealthy clients who might have been tax-exempted by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million of unjust business revenues plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich clients -- a veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
A customer's money flow started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity, investing because of poor speculation and managing assets as a result of aid and promoting tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it seemed that UBS was able to break the situation, as this disaster had happened with a trader, and one single trader had dropped €1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clearly not working in the Investment Division risk management.
The incident from Adoboly clearly showed that risk control had not changed enough, says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking, University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “UBS has no risk control tool”
It is caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's largest assets - not excessive risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank seifs have become a symbol of immeasurable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a subtle taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still matches the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Its location is a classic.
The bank’s main office is in Zurich in Bankhofstrass, which runs from the main station right to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
You can find jewellery firms like Tiffany's in the traditional Swiss Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credi Suisse and elite private banks, such as Julius Bair.
Heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There's a lot of leather sofas along the marble walls.
UBS knows what its customers need, reliability.
But both of the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, rejected Swiss concepts of banking - or, as the head of one small Swiss bank believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper -- like all Swiss bankers -- he's also working with the two biggest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large, particularly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
- And if there's anything, then they've been adapting to Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time.
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, made the first big profits, and then the fiasco, and no other European financial institution lost so much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“ That is the environment in which the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hessig in her book UBS.
Politicians approved 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come before that?
If asked by Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger, and the bank that continued to grow.
It also helped that two banks that formed UBS complemented each other: one was a rich but step-by-step bank that specialized in Zurich to manage assets; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all-power wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Woolfley, executive director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.
- I always thought Woolfley and Ospel were a dream team - says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
- Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deep-seated model and statistics, and Opel with his in-house instinct, going up all the way, starting with an intern at the bank--
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. He decided his models were real, Geiger says.
- It's tragic.
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is preceded by defeat.
UBS officials will remember well the meetings of the board members, at which Woolfley has always repeated the same slogan, to push Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was leading the \"Turnary Table\" - where the success of the banks was being made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do some of this.
UBS was the largest player in trade in currency and government securities.
Authorized management advisers did, however, point to a weakness, a parameter that is referred to in banking terminology as permanent income - UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had a failure in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS entered an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgage loans and sold them further, continuing to carry risks.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
- UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire - says a bank analyst, Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave after another as attempts to bring the bank into order became more difficult than it first seemed.
Posts in UBS have turned into chairs for children and remain insecure until this day.
Any who take the lead in this huge bank face an almost impossible challenge.
He must find a strategy for a bank that turned its back to all existing business models.
Heiger's bank analyst already has an idea to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment has to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss Banker was in fact considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Over the past time, he has been able to demonstrate his character and now, as stated by the Zurich Bank on Tuesday, lead UBS on a permanent basis.
Hernotti plans to return the investment bank to the extent it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to earn money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly, he still said only that they and their wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe sink down the US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened American investors early in the week.
Government changes in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline of industrial production on the continent has silenced the hope that a debt crisis can be overcome in the beginning.
The overall relief that followed the changes of Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro has fallen in relation to the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty -- but now the problems come out again, said Mark Lucini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, among others, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a 0.6 per cent drop.

\"We're not on the island, we depend on them,\" said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to quickly break the recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Warren Buffett, a legendary investor, was only able to confirm these fears, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it needed to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten - year - long principle into the garbage basket and invested in the American high - tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the share price of that older company by almost one percent against trend.
Shares closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Proud crows fill cities
Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to move out of the cities.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and crows have become part of the urban landscape, but people who complain about the dirt and the noise are growing in many human settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been reached.
At the first crows symposium in Ler in East Frizia, the experts argued that it was no longer possible for players to be expelled from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of urban problems was the migration of specially protected players, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Protection, the expanding construction and cutting of traditional nesting trees have made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under protection.
The town of Zest in Westphalia and north-west in Yewer, Deepholce, Achim under Brem and Lere have large colonies of over 600 parent couples.
A mixed project to shoot the crows at Léré led to disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described bird fishing as a special cruelty, as by catching birds in a trap and robbing them with sticks.
- The routine of movement and disillusionment does not do anything,' said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lehr.
The bustling of nests of water or cutting of trees often had undesirable consequences, said Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg, environmental expert.
“The residential areas are dispersed and large colonies are divided and distributed to other regions”
Intimidation is possible only by exception with hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
- We'll have to live with them, get rid of them - not an option -
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lehr Wolfgang Kälner.
The combination of bird scares from those in need of protection and inducement to return to other areas could be an exit.
The information booths instead of benzophile were the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds.
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational vortex route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on the life of very intelligent players is provided on information booths.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion about complaints about bird noise.
The mind and piece of these birds have gone into legends, and the players often use not only the instruments to capture the sightings, but also to make the instruments themselves.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University recently protested a bird mind measure on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to be knocked over the rain to extract the larvae of the moth.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone they needed to knock down the table.
In another experiment, smart players had to solve a more complex task.
The researchers placed a small bar - and - mole guide in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their prey with a clover.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and use hooks to hold the rope behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have dealt with this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo is taking Portugal to Euro2012.
The Bosnians and the Turks hoped to win in the last minute were not lasting.
The Favorites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the World Cup of Europe 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland occupied the latest seats in the Euro2012 champion in Poland and Ukraine.

The Czechs were sufficient 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoff against the outsider of Montenegro after a net victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily won the 1:1 score against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postig (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velozou (80th minute) killed the remaining goal behind Portugal.

Seine Lulich got the second yellow card for the 54th minute.
Portugal has already beaten Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal launched an excellent start at Lisbon Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo got an early start, hitting the gate freely from about 30 metres.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, with a 25-metre mark increasing the score to 2:0.
Bosnians, who did not open the account at the first half hour, were given their first opportunity by attacking Edina Jacko.
A former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English champion Manchester City for the 33rd minute sent the ball with his head to the lower edge of his pants, but the ball didn't cross the gate line.
Jirach Forgets the Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding became the focus of attention.
Following an attack on Elder Postig in a 36-minute Bosniak penal mine, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced the questionable toolbars by hand after fouling Fabio Quentran - Misimović.
After the break of the 2004 European Vice-Champion, a further four goals were fixed.
Peter Yirakek has cleared up all the remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are sent to the fifth consecutive European champion.
He also smiled at coach Michael Bilek and legioner Bundesliga Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkuzen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FK Nuremberg) after a mistake at the beginning that could have been disastrous.
The nine-minute rescuer, Peter Chech, prevented Tomash Sivoka from making an instant reflex.
Montenegro had the best chance of having a duet named Stewan Jobetic and Dejan Damianović on the field.
Domjanović hit the edge of the penalty site for the 40th minute and almost killed Chech's goal.
After the break, she saved the world-class Chech's three-minute holler after the FK Seoul forward left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was struck just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, there was little football in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than they did with zero:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is now almost no doubt that the coach at Gus Hiddink, who has gathered, will now release a seat on the bench of the third-place team in 2002, the Croats are on the final tour of the European champion.
The Turks were almost perfectly able to start at Maximir Stadium in front of 31,000 viewers.
The long shot of Seldjouk Inan in the seventh minute hit the rack, and Kazim Kazim's attacker couldn't put the ball on the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly captured control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued to play in excellent shape.
Legioners Bundesliga Daniel Pránich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjoukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave place to Ivan Perishic from Dortmund at 62.
Trapatoni is on his way to Euro2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first entrance to Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapatoni's team, who was already sure of their place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, captured leadership at 32, thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasilles of the team compared the count to the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but at the moment of the 23rd minute, Robbie Keen, from Los Angeles, made the first clean goal strike.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed not to let it move Ireland forward.
Hall was shot at 32.
With the protection of the holcier Paul Londak, Ward found himself in the right place and, throwing the ball across the line, changed the count to 1:0.

Mass killings - human dimension
Peter Englund's tense and very good new book, Krasota and Grief: The Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of individuals from whom the heart freezes.
Here is the advice to read further: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund reports, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse at moments when, like one of these men and women, you will get off the road and lose yourself in the mist of war.
Mr. Engleund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's writing now is unusual, he's describing it quite precisely as an anti-history work--
There are few known names, treaties, or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, crafty journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
This is not so much a book about what was, he explains, how much a book about what it looked like -- it's a sense, an impression, a state of mind and a state of mind --
The book Krasota and Grief brought together the experience of war-years of 20 more or less undesirable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from school-schoolers and botanical scientists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's gonna get caught, lose their hand or their leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are dead here as candles of the church: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a severe trench war on the Western Front.
The beauty and sorrow are skillful in providing the panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A soldier in this book is hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's a very exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina smelling smokeless dust.
When you're not far from hearing the canonade, and you're a woman and you're at home with the children, you'll stay there or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost nobody knows what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
- A lack of facts - - noted Mr. Engleund - - filled with speculations, speculations, hopes, fears, impositions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours -
The fate of such people as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories about their lives can be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the minor moments and gap points gathered by Mr. Engleund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, \"Earzac, everywhere is the Erzac.\"
- Replacement, fake aluminium, non-real rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons
He's still talking about ersatz food in Germany.
He describes the meat of a pressurized rice welded in a baran of fat (and adorned with false bone made from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes broken with wood,
He notes that there were - 837 registered substitutes for sausage-allowed meats, 511 registered coffee substitutes -
Some stories tell us about honor and courage.
One American observes the urge for cruelty herself and says of the war: “You feel that, after all, it is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspaper or bestseller, and to say that this show is a civilization, and under your scenic shirts, there is no barbarity under cover.”
On the contrary, a British soldier observes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
“ When a person comes to terms with the idea of self - sacrifice, he would like to think that this will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But on the contrary, it's terrible to look like a conscripted man whom they hang in secret.
Other comments relate to ancient Europe, which is falling apart and to new forms of fear.
- Conflict was becoming increasingly an economic competition - - Mr. Engleund writes, - the war factories -
He notes the arrival of the one who is called the new species in the diocese of the beginning century: the beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-scattered suit that sets up the slaughter by sitting at a written table.
People act in an unexpected way: low-level acts as much as heroism.
Mr. Engleund told of soldiers who tried to trick prostitutes into having a venereal disease in order to avoid serving on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and painted on genitals in hopes of going to hospital,” he writes.
♪ The people who were left desperate ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ the people who were left feeling ♪ ♪
Moved with Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but non-army, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of tiny scenes, he shows how the war - frees completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred -
People start asking why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Great War and Modern Memories - Paul Fassela or novels such as “In the West Front without Change - Erich-Mary Remarck, rather than exhaustive historical work.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unfathomable pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in the wrong literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he got from the book to the list page, pulled it out of your hand, and set it on fire with a stick.
After the previous mistake, carefully designed raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
Night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there should have been fewer people in Zukotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, the others first said that they were going to the training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events, and his presence stressed the importance of the operations of the Police Department.
There could have been no repetition of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of excess gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to release Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe the occupations taking place in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randalls Island, based on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police - with Lower Manhattan in mind.
The last training was held on Monday night on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came at the last minute - he told a source familiar with the orders that referred only to the task as - training -
“The few cops I know and called for did not say they were sent to Zukotti Park,” said the man who spoke anonymously.
- The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department. -
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who had swung inside before the deadline, hearing of the plans.
On Tuesday, officers from various police units participated, including police teams from the districts, who were usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, came and left the park during the day, making one hour of the night a suitable time to march.
“ It was the right thing to do when there was the least people in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers, gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
A searchlight and prerecorded announcements made by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 p.m., giving the protesters time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to eyewitnesses, met perimeters to get inside if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police worked and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that the machines with TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of protesters' personal belongings, including bags, plastic blankets and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what was abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled outside, and pictures of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions next to the camp kitchen, at the park centre.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter had their hands in their arms together.
And two people stuck themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed in about 75 minutes, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons had been arrested in the park.
Most had been arrested for \"violation of public order and resistance to detention \" , he said.
The highest officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Poulaski, the head of the department's nursing police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, though present, had not led the operation, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they had to enter.
The barriers were placed in Cortland Street, north of the park, and in Pine Street, south of the block.
Observers have seen the police from these positions extend the perimeter even beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a police team, many of them with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, took air out of the tires of a police van.
At some point a piece of fans flew out of the crowd.
As a result, a police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Trade union of school service staff in the city to the dismissal court
The union, representing hundreds of staff in service schools who had lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor pupils were enrolled.
Trials are probably the last resort available to the District Council Trade Union 37 trying to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator of the work with parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling the town ' s political reaction to their refusal to grant access to health funds administered by groups of workers to close the hole in the budget last spring.
Urban officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, Dennis M. Waltt, chancellor of the schools, said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the Board members advised him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Board reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Department of Education that an action had been brought against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to formalize the case to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Waltcott and the Department of Education of the City will be identified as the defendants and listed as the plaintiffs of eight temporary dismissals, all black or Latin American women, as most of them lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City Law Department, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in the schools of Upper East Side or Tribeki, 17 school assistants lost places in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: “It is not the areas of close parenthood that can find money to fill the gaps in the budget”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed its way of counting additional funding for every poor student entering school.
Trade union also claims that school principals may have been misled by a notification language allowing the separation of job coordinators from their parents.
The notice used the word “exceeding” - although “exceeding” - to say more often when a school pay teacher is moving from the school’s pay sheet to the existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
- Sixty-six parents' work coordinators were dismissed - - in draft action, - - not just translated -
Mission ended, Congress ready for Libya agreement
It seems that the Republicans and the Democrats at the Capitoli hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, the long-standing dictator Muamar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution issued by Chairman John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who commends the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the American troops for their freedom of worship,
“The purpose of the resolution is to honor the courageous people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country” said Kerry.
- This confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties -
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the United States Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the United States operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress is sufficiently irritated to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually knock the ground off her feet.
Then the events overruled Congress's infallibility.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is praised by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom -- and thanks men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism --
The resolution also confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya -
Would the new measures be fully supported by the Council for Foreign Affairs or split legislators like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans in the Committee, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives this week should vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a primary legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to be made to the plenary of the Congress.
Other legislators had not yet managed to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they had not tried.
Goodlat's amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments covering the wide range of issues that have been put in place.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - while others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and something else in control of federal expenditure -
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors -- mostly the newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their summaries -- the opportunity to boast that they've made such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, held in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressors wish to limit the terms of office of members of Congress and José Serrano (Democracy, New York) member of the House of Representatives wishes to cancel the two-term limitation for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Decrates, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as has another that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the States object to them.
As Congress members have endeavoured to propose amendments, they have not moved faster than in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while in the 110s they made 66.
This pace has occurred since the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they made no more progress than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, was adopted in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
- Killed but not defeated - - says Giffords in his first television interview after an attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the Gabriel Giffords House of Representatives (democracy party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel Monday night, a tune came up from a Broadway show - the sun would come back tomorrow - and said that she wanted to get better than go back to Congress.
Coming into program - 20/20 - A-bi-si-News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her how difficult it was to recover from a bullet injury, which split the skull and hit the left side of the brain, from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the debt bill.
In her first television interview, following the January shooting, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang, and called her recovery difficult.
To Sawyer's question, as she feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied: “Very good...
An interview with Giffords and her husband, an astronaut named Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special issue — 20/20 — that was shown on the eve of a new book by Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope —
The Hiffords re-emergence on January 8 after the shooting.
The first few weeks of Kelly's video is on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Tossed with his head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word was, \"What is it?
A few days later, Giffords made the second word - exactly - a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by Ai-bi shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see a congressman singing with Dr. Girls just wanting to party, Cindy Loper and the Free Fall, Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told him that he had read a paper in the newspaper about the 12 March shooting when she stopped him to first ask about the six that had been killed.
The suspect, Gerd Lee Lafner, is detained in Missouri prison and is subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
- A lot of people are dead. - Giffords Sawyer said.
- Hard, heavy, heavy -
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said: “I am defeated.
And I said, \"Hebby, you're not defeated.\" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll go through it, you'll get better, and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration at Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock slept to ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines were alarmed.
The audience in the tuskings applauded him.
David Salzman, who had arranged for the spring raiser's money collection.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the then Chairman of the Staff Chiefs Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the military in a different way.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
The contrary impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Troops are losing their praise for their victims.
But the praises have their price, the soldiers say.
The public behaves more and more as if they are feeling pity for people in shape.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and was soon leaving for Afghanistan.
♪ But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unfortunates ♪
It is a sensitive subject for military personnel who do not want to look unappreciative or unfriendly with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of the Viet Nam war has been much worse.
As a result, most complaints of pity take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from hostilities in the Marines, Colonel Mark Kenshn, on resignation, warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they have thundered the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others will wonder if, under the masquerade, an evil veteran -- said Kanshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take up a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he could withstand the pressure of responsible work in Washington, D.C. right after the fighting.
Kanshn recalls what he said to his sons: “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect...
The awkwardness experienced by the military is partly from the American indifference to war.
The fighting field has rarely been won by a country that has little knowledge of the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in the way it was normally in World War II,” says Lieutenant General David Bairn, who commanded the United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of the soldier.
Troops are estimated by the number of campaigns they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of their losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week, in historic court hearings, it is to be decided whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-responsibility of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Elizabeth Lyman’s Private First Class 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy were reportedly raped by her fellow worker at night.
That was in October 2008, and she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and met a male servant carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
- It was a red flag. - Lyman says.
But Texas’s mother - in - law was afraid.
I thought, no, he's 19.
He's from Texas, she said.
- I wish I didn't obey my instinct at the time.
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came to her back, fell down and raped her, she says.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and a further 27 present and former soldiers will be eager to await the court ' s decisions at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether the lawsuit they brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld will be brought before the court.
The lawsuit alleged that Gates and Ramsfeld had failed to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The suit filed in February by Susan Burke, from Washington D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs but rose to 28 in the following months, 25 women and 3 men, who all claimed to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their peers, and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure adequate justice following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted at the top of the army, because the problem starts with them.
- The army is a vertical structure - she says.
- Who are the people who can kill the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom could participate in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open up a lot of things if she needs to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team of the Ministry of Defence, under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to put an end to the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek received reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim military damages in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision Doktrina Ferrez, the Federal Government was not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“Proposed damage is a risk to the plaintiffs' military service” is stated in the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in combat, this separation is only in the words of the fact that modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
The army is also about to become modern, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; three others are being prepared in addition to her trial.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academy on the charge of promoting a women's hate atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of the American War Veterans in Viet Nam is being brought against the army, which is the centre of personality diagnosis - which is being placed by victims of violence to prevent them from serving - a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group, The Organization for Action of Women Soldiers.
The group filed a suit against the Veterans ' Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the treatment of pensions by persons who claimed to have been threatened by sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But as is known, attacks are often not reported, with the Pentagon's own estimate of approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported reached court, twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Berk case call them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times as many police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from a cut on her hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive description to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
- I remember the day the verdict was read - Lyman says.
- I thought I was being born right now - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.
They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember that my commander said, \"It wasn't a trial for him.
Lyman was ordered to address a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personality change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was fired with an adverse wording, which prevented her from obtaining any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her associates will move forward on the matter is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are able to move forward —
Between them and the verdict stand the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've criticized Doctrine Ferres for my whole life.
The army has been lagging behind for decades because it has no incentive or deterrents to impose responsibility.
He adds: \"Shans are very much against them... but it's important for them to try.\"
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing does not benefit them, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
The walls have eyes, as researchers are studying you on Facebook.
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was a regular guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, who killed 77 people, entered his first open trial.
Even though Bravik was able to operate alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent a lot of time trying to attack his computer, associating with millions of nationalists who support right groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy, we just have to get on Facebook.
We realized that it was not easy to get close to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of the recently published European Cyber-Populism Report of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The supply of personal data on Facebook is so huge, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy that marketing scientists have done for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then gave them an advertisement, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the advertisements offered the user a survey that asked questions about their level of education, violence, and optimism about their future.
With Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to interview 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries, not even leaving the office.
- It's a completely new way to do research. - Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not as striking: right-wing groups online - most of them young men who are displeased with immigration.
But suddenly, those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor --
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new and popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and political scientists use the site to explore everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in Lake, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three entries a day, \" Superactive Information \" , Facebook generates a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site at 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook is an excellent way to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
- If you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.
- You'd have to join the party, and they'd never have accepted you. - Says Bartlett.
- Facebook disables all of this - you are drawing them directly
Others say that this site could identify and explore social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drinking feats on Facebook were significantly more exposed to the risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their dormitories mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
- You can't solve the problem without detecting it, - reported Washington Post Demitri Christakis, co-sponsor Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
- We found a way to identify children from a risk group who could not otherwise be identified -
Facebook also constantly fetches various kinds of data about its users.
The website data processing team handled status and day statistics on Valentin, voter appearance at midpoint in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information available only to them, the Cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, they like it or they don't -- in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with someone thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for off-line research, online data are publicly available.
- I don't think many users have at least thought about what a researcher can watch for their profiles. - says Neil Selwin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, of a study he conducted in 2006 using the Facebook public pages of students.
- Before they imagined it was between them and their friends.
Then there is the question of methodology.
There's no guarantee even offline that the subject of the study is so honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information is in the profile and the user page is true.
What you're talking about Facebook and what you're doing outside of Facebook are two completely different things.
This is why, despite years of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
It is suggested that social studies - social studies - and most social studies - are still off-line -
- Cold and inhumane - Anders Bering Brawick will be brought to trial for the first time.
Anders Bering Brawick, a man who confessed to a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter - during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
- I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Tampleiers of Norway - he spoke before 500 in the courtroom.
I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and that support multiculturalism.
“I admit actions, but I don’t admit guilt.”
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he didn't want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views--
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had given a written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Bravik for another 12 weeks, banned his access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all eight-week visits and correspondence.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Bravik in their eyes, others to make sure he's in the lock.
All came to find answers to their questions.
- I thought he looked cold and inhuman - - told the Norwegian NRK canal one of the survivors in Utaya.
- It was uncomfortable, but I actually got a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect--
The dark suitor and blue tie, Bravik, remained calm and professional throughout the entire hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a large movement - resistance - the judge held that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he was acting with the accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the attack on 22 July appears to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
- I'd like him to look like a monster, but that's not the case.
- It would be much easier if it were -
7 lessons from a lost interview by Steve Jobs that show at the theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Instigator of Today.
But the fact that Apple fans can count as the biggest discovery in the newly discovered interview, which was remembered in advance of the pre-screening in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind has understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippy, but he was also a perfect organizer and modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from “the disease of thinking that a really big idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a big idea from a big product separates a huge amount of artificial labour”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a TV series called Triumph Nerds on the advent of his personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs in a unique long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he was already working at his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerdas, he says the originals were missing in transportation.
Only after Jobs' death did a complete VHS copy be found in the director's garage.
This piece of material, slightly edited, was the basis for Steve Jobs' 68-minute film: A Lost Interview, which goes to Landmark Theatres on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who's known for his hatred of a detailed interview, Jobs seems to be not used to setting out his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points in the interview, there are big intervals between questions and answers -- reflections for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to tell more.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where he seems angry with Kringley's issues, making him move faster to issues or to events of greater importance.
In the lost interview in Pixar, Aypods, and Aiphones that he had dropped before, there was something evil prophetic when Jobs was evaluating what he saw different companies doing right and wrong and offering their own vision of future information technology.
One thing to read about the fatal assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something that's wounding and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he told everyone here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the lost interview:
How he learned how to run a business:
I kept asking: \"Why do you do this\" and the answers you always get: \"Oh, it just does that.\"
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks very deep in the business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continue to describe in detail their attempts to rationalize reporting in Apple.
A structured way of recording costs that often started with standard costs - which were taken from the ceiling and then driven by precision - it established an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business costs up to a small point.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells us about the blue box -- which he painted with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to hack the phone and call it free of charge.
The device has been written a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria is here to describe the blue box as an act of giving power to the infected.
He talks about how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
- We covered the ground ball of a paltry once, and you yelled at the phone car, and it got through a minute later to the next phone car-- says Jobs with a smile.
We were young, and all we've learned is that we could paint something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world --
We two knew a little bit, but we could paint a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, it could ever come up with Apple.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous withdrawal that he and Wozniak had practically succeeded in calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope for a telephone call, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, the two were laughing right before the Pope himself was raised to answer on the phone.
About love in technology (and the cold term Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he found Bill Hewlett in a telephone directory while hunting spare parts to build a frequency meter.
Not long after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job in Hewlett Packard.
- It influenced me greatly, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what the company was and how well they treated their employees -
Jobs later became one of the HP's staff who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw the very first desktop computer --
He was about the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often went to HP with a teenager and walked around that car and wrote programs for her.
Improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs' interview talks about inventing new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of mounting fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
\"I remember angry disputes... and they yelled at me that it would take five years\" [to gather a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sitting down my throat, and I went out, and I found a designer.\"
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
On large companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs had accurately anticipated how many of the industry's leaders would look at the situation and lose control of their share of the market.
Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you're making the best cop or printer, and what--
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so those who end up running companies, and people who make the product are pushed out of the decision making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is pushed away by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times bigger, could have been Microsoft '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
- A great idea from a big product is that a lot of artificial work... when you unfold a big idea, it changes and grows...
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to go to -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head, these concepts, all of them together...
After all, everything comes down to taste, everything goes down to trying to express yourself in the best way people ever did, and then later, trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Pikasso said good artists dig, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed of big ideas.
The fact that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and the world's best information technology professionals was a part of what made Macintosh famous.
If it were not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with the opponents of the Health Act while the court is hearing the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met with closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would hear the repeal of President Obama's Health Act, its two judges, Antonina Scullia and Clarence Thomas, were following a dinner sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case to the highest court.
This incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition before them.
One case on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative nation-wide activists.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour turning debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at the very start of the time the judgement will be rendered.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Care Act must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement's Law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that has consistently advocated conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The lunch was held at Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act, was present.
Honorary guests for dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the Federal Society for many years.
And that is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
Had they complied, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal organizations and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or mentioned in the programme of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, like a company with greater financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“It is a shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code that contradicts the claims of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Del.
- The judges were drinking and having dinner at an official fund-raising action with lawyers who are currently being tried in court
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all allegations of negligence and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly point to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Federal Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration, when the first judicial objections to the law were filed at the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law at the time to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show you she was gonna do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion aircraft order
Airplane Emirates orders 50 large-scale Boeing 777 liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal worth over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets a 50-per-product order.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. and the cost of all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
So much more important is where Boeing got the order: Middle East, growing gold kept future orders for airplanes.
In the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that the Middle East will require 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing annotated on this weekend his largest dollar equivalent to commercial aircraft, 50 two-pass Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft that will raise the total premium price to $26 billion, said Boeing to Aviashow Dubai 2011.
Later Monday, he told Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which could boast much better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The pre-eminent price for six aircraft would be over $1 billion.
- That's really good for Boeing.
The quality of these particular buyers is quite high -
Many Middle East airlines own oil-friendly countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but also the rise in fuel prices, which is usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest items of expenditure that is not so much destroyed because the country is making money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of aircraft when prices go up, Diora said.
\"They have natural protection,\" he said.
The Emirates Order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-fluided aircraft market and helps prevent Airbus SAS from attacking its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus said he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competes just from 777-300ER.
It postponed debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded increased freight capacity and range of flight.
Boeing Co shares have grown 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost her vote in the Michoacan election
Louise Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped Fausto Vallejo's opponents from IRP in a pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon did not appear to have applied for the seat of Governor Michoakán during the violent public elections, and she stated on Monday that the drug traffickers had helped to induce a race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional and Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader in the race for the West Governor's seat.
“Vision of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoakán, but also for the whole country,” said Louise Maria Calderón on a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
They threatened our candidates, our employees in the election... and they caught ballot boxes, placed obstacles... and forced people to vote for IRP.
IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seemed to have only a little chased Calderón, who had led the ratings before the election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Valleho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the Governor's chair, has come a third - serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left of the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Moreela, denied contact with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have long dominated drugs.
This is President Calderon's native state, and he chose Michoakán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
The mayor was killed a week before the elections when he voted for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For IRPs, however, however, whether or not the elections in Michoacán looked terrible, the victory will give rise to the momentum of the party.
The man who is supposed to represent IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valleho and said: “I think this victory should be very encouraging in the eve of next year.”
ADB persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to helping save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid the long-term downturn that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that two of the fastest-growing large economies should do their best to accelerate the recovery of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties — impartially — and said that Asian financial cooperation side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
- We're all dealing with that.
- That's why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful - he told Financial Times in an interview during the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
Asia can be protected to some degree, but it cannot be irrefutable
- So if China and India can help, it has to be done -
The European Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
Italy's borrowings have increased alarmingly in recent days, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could once again lead the world economy to recession, and it led leading developing economies to meet together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be provided through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid fund bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- would provide tremendous strength in the negotiations between Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce of India, said that “India will do its best to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital flows.
\"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,\" he said.
- We have enormous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth -
- It's not a possible option, it's a prerequisite, because where we're going to find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls -
Others argue that it does not make any sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warsaw, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to assist Europe with 1.2 billion Indian people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
At some point, they'll find that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to holidays by sea, and that's not going to be good,' he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why Indian reserves should be used to accommodate Greek multiple and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, lost enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Ng said that the eurozone crisis was threatening, with significant direct consequences, across Asia.
The ADB forecast of 7.5 per cent of Asia’s growth in 2011/12 was now faced with threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to draw up business plans to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's terrible warnings of potential reductions in defence costs
The Defence Minister, Leon Panette, set in motion Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and generate a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already experiencing a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions of 600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
- The consequences of these reductions would be devastating to the Ministry - - he told Panette in a letter to the Republican senator John McCain, Arizona, and the Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress ' s failure to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester had initiated a 23 per cent reduction and the cessation of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building -- and will seriously harm other attempts at modernization -- wrote Panette to senators.
“We will also have to lay off many of our civil servants and, since the reduction will take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay down the civilian staff to achieve our goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious war damage”
The reductions eventually affected the military, said Panette.
“Although military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by sequester operations, military achievements will be seriously affected by the serious disruption in core budgets” warned Panette.
- Contract personnel will be reduced to the end of the cancellation of contracts and of the oversight contract that the troops support . -
Staff will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated
Two senators wrote the Panette 10 days ago, asking for details about the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
The consequence of the sequester in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power
“We are persistently opposed to these dragon actions,” the senators were told in a joint statement on Monday night when they announced a letter to the Panette.
- It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose it.
“The sister is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen”
Will the letter of the Pannet or the latest warnings of the senators lead to a budgetary compromise or will increase calls for the release of the Pentagon from the reductions that will be seen later.
Panette was quite sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary reviews in Congress and the White House and aware that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a depraved picture of what might follow -- an army with a shell, but without a nucleus.
♪ It's a ship without sailors ♪
- It's a unit without a bullet.
- It's the wing of a plane without enough trained pilots -
“It is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” said Panette in her introductory remarks in Pentagon.
“It is a force which suffers from an unsteady spirit of warfare, a bad will, and unable to fight against potential enemies.”
♪ In fact, it encourages aggression ♪
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panette, new details of how reductions are defusing significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond everywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations -
And Panette said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles, including those that have already passed tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and Marines need to replace the Hammer.
The cessation of further development and testing of F35 may save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step in order to improve and counter the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Mistake a Lie
A careful look at recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Kane, is working to challenge allegations of sexual harassment against several women; each party is accusing the other of lying.
The administration of Pennsylvania University was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicholas Sarkozy was caught telling President Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar at the microphone.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner have shown themselves to be a fool, denying their conclusions, which has been quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
A former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to hide out of wedlock.
Again, none of the survivors at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was told he was lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term of office.
The history of school and college fraud is a regular matter.
There have been cases where teachers have responded to tests in order to have a good evaluation of their performance.
Instructors who must teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, research suggests that between 10 and 200 times can lie to you.
A large part of this is now supposed to be a lie to salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other.
The identification of lies or the identification of lies is a necessary skill for each individual and professional purpose.
Unlike a room game that seems like a sharad, where you have to say \"We've got to call\" \"We've got a lie\" , a serious course of knowledge based on scientific evidence gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities that are engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been disintegrated.
The liars are looking into the eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, grow red, or dress.
It is not to be concluded that liars find it difficult to detect and expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimicry, the structure of the questions and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-increasing segment of knowledge about lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars have the advantage of being able to read others, making them feel unloved, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling as others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than to single people (but the lies they say are more likely to go mad).
We also know that if you are perceived to be a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, monitor the normal behavior of your target.
It's called the reference state definition.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing change further.
Watch your pose, laugh, voice-over.
It would be good for you to know if a person is always knocking with his feet in a normal state, then you won't make unjust accusations when you see a foot knock in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
The cheaters can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet on the front of the door, lean towards exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show \"relief after an interview\" -- this exaggerated feeling of relief and a shift of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end of an interrogation signal to simply look at this relief after an interview.
So, look at your subject's talk.
It is known that Scott Peterson came back and used the past tense, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Persuasive people can also use distance in speech: \"I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski... or I'll ask you a big question.
The most typical note indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use the qualification language when answering the difficult question, \"Okay... in the truth, how much I know... how much I know...
This makes the answer more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magic to detect lies, but you can learn how to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of becoming a victim of artificial stings in their professional and personal lives.
The standby plan for the pipeline needs to be revised after the threat of the US to postpone its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, exposing trade unions to anger, but calming the environmental defenders, the oil pipeline company claims to be willing to review the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Pescan hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still receive approval.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the Nebrasca Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, albeit on a different route.
This is after the State Department ' s statement last week that it will postpone the project ' s decision at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the area of Pescani hills of Nebraska and the account holder of Ogalala, an enormous groundwater supply.
- It's a real step forward,' said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Nebraskan.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Department of State is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, following the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved policies.
Obama made a written statement last week calling for and supporting the Department of State.
The oil pipeline, 1,700 miles long, should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 70,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil-fired factories in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental advocates, but loved by trade unions, who look forward to some 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But nebra lawmakers who oppose the plan are considering a bill to accelerate the movement from the Sand hills and Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current study by the Department of State on environmental impacts had shown that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry had stated that the Department ' s auditor had requested a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One represents a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the choice of firm that had been employed to carry out an initial study was inappropriate because it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was sued for allegedly causing the child to be sick with fear
The family in New York City claims that Patty LaBelle's disco-dividing began to hunt in their foreheads at their home in Manhattan, frightened their little daughter to such an extent that she was scared.
Lady Marmalade, an 18-month-old Geneva Monk, is so scared that she's changed her personality, her sleep disorder -- and her family's fear of strangers -- to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieva were about to travel on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went into the lobby of the building on Riverside boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said that she stood by the door and put her daughter down for a minute.
Someone came up to me from the back and said, \"You know what your daughter is doing, I said, and I went to pick her up, she said.
LaBelle angrily spoke to a pregnant woman.
She aggressively said, \"You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door.\"
I said to her, \"I don't care what you say or think.\"
She came to rage and started to use slurring -- the word on C and the word on F -- in elevated tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said that Genevieve had a hysteria.
“ I said to this woman, ‘ Look what you did to my daughter! ’
LaBelle attacked her mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her escorts had to hold her back and push her into a waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The little girl wept so hard that she moaned, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle an apology note but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and representatives of LaBelle do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to contribute any money that they received to the charity of children with cancer.
- The purpose is to make Patty LaBelle responsible for his actions.
- Such behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher, with an 18-month-old child in his arms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López’s government in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 - year, which will be part of Sinaloa ' s economic history as associated with the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in key economic development indicators.
Not only did the low temperatures of February cause millions of losses to the agricultural sector, but they limited the potential for growth in the public economy by reducing the overall economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly because of the historic decline of 31,16 per cent in agriculture, which had an impact on the performance of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by the frost provided by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected entirely and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered in part; the main damaged crops were vegetables, corn and nuts.
The decline in economic activity occurred until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, a steady increase in unemployment rates was recorded during the first three quarters, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent active population, an increase of 5.28 per cent in the second quarter and an increase of 6.19 per cent from July to September, a percentage of over 74,000 Sinaloa unemployed persons, an increase of 18.969.
Reduce liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been driven by many factors over the course of the year, for economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), and the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market with a view to limiting the resources imposed by Congress's legislation to combat money-laundering, because people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use them in something, he said.
Remained immigration
López Cervantes said that unemployment is also a demographic factor in growth.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of employment abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily because of the difficulty of entering, and in the second, because, once they have entered, they are already faced with a great many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remain and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, unemployment is rising” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is worse if the large number of labour-dominated violations, according to INEGI, is reported by 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population to work without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and maltreatment, a further reminder of the state ' s employment is provided by low wages; in the state, the lowest salaries in the country are reported by the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos, before September.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, 2011 recorded the largest foreign direct investment outflows over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state FDI stood at $630,697. This represents a drop of $87.74 per cent, compared with $5,143.312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the Minister for Economic Development of the State Government has recorded a total of 17.280,000 peso investments during the year, which has mostly come from the service sector.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the State Government requested a 3 billion peso loan during the State Congress in July to be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in order to revive the economy, at the local level, only 2,600 million pesos were approved and, until November, debt advantages were not expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez demonstrates the lack of capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that the harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government itself, lacked during 2011.
“The economic efficiency of Sinaloa this year has been really low, has to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have failed to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, and we hope the next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that events such as the early freeze this year had stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth had been limited.
“The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, and one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not become fast enough to create economic momentum that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and thus, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations” he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme must be developed that redefines the direction and economic course of the state, and that all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has to mobilize,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining a future direction to better guide the efforts of the Government.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, and there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that much needs to be done,” he said.
He's sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income fine - the sentence was handed down to a Navolato citizen for the possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the sentenced drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of a health offence, in this case, of keeping marijuana for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of the streets of Cyprusano Valdez, before post No. 80 in Al Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pick-up car in which he carried a black bag in a box in a car and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second Regional Court and the accused remains a prisoner at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions to work need to be made
Social work relating to such programmes as the Family, the Saving of Social Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risks being left unfinished or delayed for a long time due to a lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development said that, while the work programmes had so far evolved, they were in danger because the State Government was unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amounted to an amount exceeding 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall funding for all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so a delay in their completion was still possible.
- They have to invest nearly 12 million, and although the year is over, they have given us no copy when they were supposed to give us a piece since early July,' he said, \"to keep up, we started work and they've made a lot of progress, but we need the money.\"
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was due to make, so that at the beginning of the term of office, the municipality had to raise money to cover more than 7 million dollars that had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
- This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programmes continued to evolve, and this year to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state needs to do - he explained.
While the state had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made in the name of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that their interest would arrive as soon as possible.
- They've got to make almost 12 million, and even though it's over for a year, they haven't given us a copy of it.
The Court will approve the 2015 digital television transfer in Mexico.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have affected the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (WS) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which moved the so-called digital television transition from 2021 to 2015, since eight votes were not cast to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing the actions to turn to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected owing to the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required by the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right enshrined by law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cophetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
According to this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein concerning the conversion to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the demands of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft and also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Kordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project ' s arguments in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
I also do not think that, if this were to happen, it would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulatory authority and recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as telecommunications, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, to government of the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has led to better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay of the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of conversion to a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which have more than just a technical dimension — as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues —
These questions, he said, “require the whole system of public economic governance to include a group of authorities, which the Constitution consolidates into the State executive branch”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast, and he had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, enforces the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting - the voice behind the voice -
According to the data transferred to the PRRA, the difference between the first and the second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting the vote is real with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoakán, where according to the Preliminary Election Outcomes Programme, the difference between the first and the second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragoza, recalled that, a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoakán did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force in the electoral process and Governor Lánga Rángel did not include his publication within the time frame set out in law in the Official Gazette of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJFJ) ruled on the constitutional claim made by the local legislative assembly, calling the State ' s representative ' s vote on constitutional reform invalid and illegal because he has no right to decide or support them.
In an interview on the possibility of a voice, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, the IVM would be possible to present a partial or complete count of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, partial recalculation of one or more electoral urns may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the rn or he is not at the Chairman ' s disposal; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the general recalculation of votes in all ballots may occur when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the elections under consideration and those receiving the second ballot is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that has presented the second of the candidates.
A general recalculation of votes will also be made if, at the end of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the winner and the candidate holding the second seat is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second seat, in the event that the ballots that were taken into account in the partial recalculation are excluded.
It is worth noting that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PRRA, the difference between the first and the second seat is only 0.16 per cent, not even to count 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Saplinam, confirming the family.
The remains of Felipe Basio Cortés' pilot arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a survey and a calm mess were conducted on Monday.
According to the family, the Lieutenant Colonel’s last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains.
Following the adoption of condolences along with other people who were killed in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital, Koauela, on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, he arrived at a boulevard, Nazario Ortiz García, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he conducted a survey of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates at high school and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school education.
His desire was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Saplinama, he always told his family and friends -- that's what Sandra Cortés Basio, sister of the pilot, said.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, she thinks he was at the peak of his life, 'he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother loyal to his family'
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to the Aviation College in Zapopana, Halisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he even had a head in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, 'as only he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo'
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Saposan for the ceremony of his relative’s diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most — flying an airplane.
He's on his way.
Shots fired at Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and pupils of the Technical High School in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress in his studies, and in sports, led him on the latest route.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was managing collapsed, along with José Francisco Blake Mora, Secretary of the Government, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 Basio Cortés (crowded), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral offices of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to the esplanade of the training school where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, his pupils and teachers, had already waited for him.
Three bodies found abandoned on Kaderate ' s NL farm
In the media, 11 people were arrested in the same municipality for organized crime crimes a few hours before being discovered by the military authorities.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found at 1.5 kilometres of the Kadreita road towards Santiago, at an elevation in a commune known as El Castillo.
A number of people passing by noticed that the door was opened in a village house, with a wall painted in beige and brown.
They looked inside, literally three metres away, and immediately let the authorities know.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and there was another man next to him in a white shirt.
In almost one metre, the body of another man was found in red shirts and blue jeans.
All three were face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no hiles on the ground.
There are signs on the fence of a village house that are addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are also holes in the gates.
11 caught in Cadereite
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kaderate, and who are accused of abductions, murders, fraud, and secret graves.
According to published information, on 11 November, eight persons were arrested in the Los Alvero Colony, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called \"Los Zetas\"
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., and military personnel carried out a patrol tour in the village of Old Rancho in Kaderait when they saw a car without licence plates with two men in the living room.

Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on La Pravdah Public Land, who, when the military saw him trying to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Kaderate.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that has put that country at the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and which has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to move out of this difficult period,” said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he had been able to form the Government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
\"Structure is now well-defined,\" he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than the usual, as Italy has coped with the political and financial crisis, which has taken their debt to a critical level
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner, Monty, must approve the hard-economy package required by European leaders in order to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to hasten is that unstable markets generate 10 years more than 7 per cent of Italy ' s BTP bonds, where Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marcegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, reported to the reporters after meeting Monty: “We said that we would actively support this Government.”
We believe that this is the Government - Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's success was largely based on the support of the Sylvio Berlusconi LDP party, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty should lead to a good outcome,” said the reporters Angelino Alphano, secretary of the centralist party.
The support of LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because to date many of its members have been opposed by a government majority consisting of technocrats forming Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspending of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased its pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy ' s debt value had now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Italy ' s debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern Eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give it time to reform before setting up new elections.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that it should be drawn only from technical experts, showing their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
Spanish have more game experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
Only one of the 22 alleged players in Costa Rica played 50 games.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, when we compare the 22 players that both countries have made to the match today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, number one on the FIFA monthly rating, have a whole list of Class A games, Tricolor only has a defender, Michael Umana, as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in the powerful Prime League clubs in England during this year were very active in leagues and local cup competitions, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
Added to this is the experience of the Spanish Fury in the difficult skills of the Euro or World Cup.
Players of Ticos, however, have limited international experience in the area, such as CONCAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We can see that the list is led by Icker Casillas, a Spanish collectivist, who, last Sunday against England (a 0-1 match in London), repeated the record of Andon Subsareta's ex-Halcier, with 126 international matches.
Cassillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Casillas and Hawi were recognized as the best at UEFA last week, along with another player of the Iberian team, Subizarreta, with 126 matches and a bomber of Shalka Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost around a hundred Carlos Puyol with 97 games.
Havei Alonso followed them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Injesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica side by side with Michael Umanay, left side Hunior Diaz with 48 matches and bomber Brian Ruis from 45.
Further, only five have crossed the line of 30 games: Kalor Navas from 31, Randall Asoffef from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis Lopez from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 Spanish matches in Gérard Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31), and Raula Albhiola (31).
With fewer than 30 field trips, there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Murray with 23.
The others didn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Hordi Alba has two games, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not debuted yet.
Spain’s leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet on a tour of the country after 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, he said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group said that it was also a real dream to play in that country.
This was the Basist and Founder Jeff Amenta who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is on South America as part of a tour of 20 years of work and, on Sunday, 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day, they will speak at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with a team from Los Angeles, The X, and a local group, Las Robertas.
It's a part of a conversation that's fully deciphered online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam will play Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still going well.
I was in Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live under tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret having taken so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, view it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have been in the past two weeks.
We held some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this has shaped us into a concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, and we love to do surfing and jungle, which is about these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfers friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarido, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in Mexico, it's a great surfing place, that's how we found out, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you've done huge shows with lots of songs.
What did you plan for speaking in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make better shows with a wide variety of songs possible; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us to the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour is 20 years in your career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're going to be in a rock group and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are pleased with our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean for you to be a big part of the blossom of the border?
It has always been an honor to be part of this large team.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in the same city.
We are also proud to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhone, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and it's an honor to be part of the Seattle sound that happened.
It's also very strange that a group like you stay together in the same group for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends, and as a result, music roads have also been opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but with your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We are concerned not to be too long in the tour because it is easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
While you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did without deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We've been a group for almost three years, and we haven't released any albums until Andy Woods died.
There was a lot of frustration, because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferwezer) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football, and a lot of others.
It was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local Las Robertas group will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and so you chose to open her up?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that liked us most, so we're eager to see that Las Robertas can offer a live one, and it should be very exciting.
Why are you constantly changing words at Yellow Ledbetter concerts?
It's a question for Ed (Eddie Veder), so I don't know.
He sings her and I think he uses the first one that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you like a bassist?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to the mind, Heather Butler, John Entvisl, Si Jay Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
There's so much that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the border, even though it is no longer fashionable?
I think we're all feeling some kind of isolation from the word grand.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and everyone who came at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that should be heard, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first, your music was more gloomy, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there's songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very grim, although they may sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and those songs are very dark.
I think when you grow up and in your life there was some trauma and you lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
The ex-President, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, and his family doctor informed him of the loss of muscle in his legs.
Fuchimori, 72, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has caused him to operate four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told the television channel N that Fuhimori would be surveyed three days later at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aginaga said that in his view, Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried over four tongue cancers, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and added other diseases, such as severe erosional gastritis, stomach bones, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg bleeding problems, and listed a doctor.
Fuchimori has been in prison since September 2007 at the Police National Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people by army destruction forces, which operated secretly in the early years of his reign.
The fly is sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by President José Mujica of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujik will meet with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of a broad plan to meet with the political, commercial and Uruguayan communities living in Mexico, according to a timetable published by Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be a good exchange of information on political relations between the two nations - as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Mujika is seeking the support of Calderón for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included South America in a letter of tax harbors at a G20 meeting in the French city of Kanna.
In her speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that raised a protest by Uruguay and a response to the consultations of his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing, since November, the G20, a group established from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to accelerate the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave the “serious list” of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not enjoy international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay, in force since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (ITS), which has increased trade turnover between the two countries.
The well will become a three-dimensional c-Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pich from the evil feet of Bower, but never before did he do so in three dimensions: Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use points.
“Mario, a hero who has to tell how stereocopy will work without points,” said the head of the Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the Madrid game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is the first video game of Nintendo, specially designed under this platform -- because until now, successful products like Star Fox 64 3D -- or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D -- were adaptations to existing games.
Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land - an accessible video game that enables you to enjoy fast and mobile play.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is simple to attract less experienced users.
One day, the majority of experts will go through the second round at the level of the game, which is now more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between -D aggressive - or one that affects only the depth of the action but which needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome a variety of obstacles and - not to succumb to optical illusions -
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo groves the fans of the serial and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with his lips has to go through dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes, and enemies, as well as playing Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo's extradition process had begun to hold him responsible in the United States for a $70 million smog plot.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that required the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He argued that, during his mandate, he did not apply his hands to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures that he had ever known about.
With Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marrockin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as will Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colome has done shows an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the State ' s head from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the loss of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijave helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The outcome of the first 25 years of Trinidad ' s social support organization is important: 6,000 young people affected by social exclusion have helped overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added to this.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijave came to light with Trinitate Vela in 1986 to help young people with disabilities, lack of employment and drug problems or vulnerable to marginalization.
The celebration at Sant Andreu yesterday brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had cooperated with the association during the past 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed the same nature of the work done by Trinijave.
Following Generalite, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-consultant of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-Lt of the Mayor and the current eco-socialist, a member of Ricardo Goma ' s Municipal Council.
It also came to Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare and family adviser, Josép Lewis Claris, and La Caixa Social Work Coats, Haume Lanasp.
He said that Trinijuve came to light in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far is a good basis.
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and of instilling hope in people in difficult circumstances.
- Crisis was not new to the organization and work she had been given, he said.
The evacuated building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The hijackers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the Balmes Street building, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without fighting
It seems that a nightmare experienced by neighbors living in a house 51 on Balmez Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left voluntarily at noon at a building that they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated their neighbours by court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
- From now on, there's a pass control here,' said the manager.
The squatters, who had taken 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were settled, took all the electricity and some water, painted walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Immediately behind the building is the nightclub, Balmez 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinate, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income has declined by 80 per cent.
The club owner says that the strikers got her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, whereas at the club for ten, they sold drinks for three euros.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, although she observed that the noise was not caused by the club's visitors, but by the squat and, above all, by those who had attended the parties that had organized them, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, according to angry neighbours.
The club owner said that the inconveniences were so great that she had even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he is - he is forgiving - she has paid her rent.
The City Police have also confirmed that more complaints have been received from neighbours over the past few weeks.
The PP Chairman, adviser Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week that the building be evacuated immediately to address the problems of coexistence and common spirit that prevailed with neighbours and degradation in this area.
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all floors and virtually every house and that some of them had been broken.
In this sense, he added that “to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Noe Barris.
At 15:30 p.m., the police went to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who saw four people enter the building.
Four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition after a dispute of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the present-day Capital Corporation of Barcelona (KSR), the administration printed pro-listis for Kolserola.
The tract described the mountain as a big park in the capital Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures of New York Central Park.
With the death of the SKB, in 1987, the park was again ranked in the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital city of Catalonia, one of the few that is not oriented north-south but up (mountain) down (sea).
Colserola's position as a natural park contradicts that idea.
It was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yoga bear.
That was the case until, in September, the council announced huge competitions, consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates to Kolserola.
Under the gates is the idea of the park, of course.
Either way or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
One question is: Calserola, a park or a mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
It is hardly the most recurring theme discussed when two members of this clan of elected people learn about each other in an elevator.
This fact leads to exactly one of the few coincidences between the words of the three architects of Barcelona and the scholars who attended.
Miguel Roland, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: contest appropriate
For Raldan, once the shoreline has been reached, it becomes necessary to discuss the front side of the mountain - when Ildephon Cerda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
- Let's say Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, it has been made accessible in a beautiful way.
Collserols are more complicated -- says the architect, for whom the heading \"Colserols' Gate\" contains \"word trap\" -- we should not think of them as entering the park, but as limiting some of the areas where we should act --
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with his experience in urban construction, called the proposal -- intellectual challenge -- some dangers --
Risks arising from the uncertainty of public space forecasting - following experience in the 80s, which ended at the Forum site with its petrified song -
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step - it means the transition.
“We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [as far as the capital master plan (GSP)] can lead to real distress.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than a purely topographical question.
Modolo recalls that there is already a work done outside of Calserola that should not be missed by the ears - although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join the project - from the very beginning -
Moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a passage that allows architects to engage in the debate, but - he doubts - whether this technical profile is what the multidisciplinary success teams should be led by - it argues - which was meant to create: - Architects should only be a tool -
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question posed by the title of this part is composed because the rules of competition do not contain a common view of the Colserola: \"There have been 16 overlapping contests announced, he says, \"in the meaning of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the area as a whole.\"
This has led, at least in his case, to the participation of 16 contests.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may intersect by programme and definition with a draft architect for a neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the council has been advised to guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide an area in its entirety equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino judicial representative forgave the Mayor of Monterrey's brother in the proceedings against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative Red Casino has forgiven him before the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, owner of Red Cassino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos where, allegedly, Manuel Yonas, demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities a secret operation in a game house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened criminal proceedings against the Mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage, he was sent to a temporary prison located in an old part of the State capital.
This place remained for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had deleted bribes and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extorting half a million peso from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with a moderate degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garz.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evident evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as the charging of 1.5 million pesos by bookkeepers in exchange for the resolution of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesino to ask for pardons for a brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could enjoy freedom in the following hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor before the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether he had recovered the damage and which of the partners in the play house would grant pardon, even though he had tried not to speak the name.
On the basis of records 197/2011, legal pardons were granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements could then be made regarding the process that had been planned against him; nor would any reparation and punishment be necessary.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookers, at about 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicholas Prison in Garz to notify Jonah that he was lawfully forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by a judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hácomé describes the details of the disaster where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport reported that the results of an accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in complete integrity without attempting to conduct an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hácomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft got up, the pilot had found that the weather was suitable for flight.
“Elements that appear to indicate that the vessel had some contact with the land, the wings came into contact with trees on 25 metres, where the equipment had lost its fluorescent -
He also stated that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the vessel, the impact has occurred in a state of structural integrity.
The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, meeting the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground at this location is between 7 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
To this point, the secretary said that the main thing was to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the blow, the presidential helicopter was guided at a cruise speed and that it occurred on soft, rising soil.
- This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the time of the strike. - He said.
At a press conference, the owner of the STC, Pérez Hácomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight took place under visual flight rules, which means that the team should be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when an aircraft went to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower altitude zone and greater visibility in the Kuernawak Valley.
The place of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording from the radar of the aircraft probably coincided with no loss of control or change of direction before impact.
Decay of debris in small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and the side line.
The scattering of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter is facing the ground in a structurally integrated environment.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
Unaccompanied evidence remains in the disaster area in the wreckage of a vessel, some type of explosion or fire.
Recent research shows that there could have been multiple contacts with the land.
While working on the ground, pieces of aircraft were found at a height of 9.200 feet above sea level, the earth has a slope of 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had some land collisions.
After a thorough study, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found in more territory than the marked zone near the site where the disaster occurred, thus reinforcing the assumption that the impact had occurred in a structural integrity.
MSS announces a program to search for the obese gene
Social protection is led by a study on the gene of obesity among children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect the obesity gene of children and young people, called the protocol “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents”, which would calculate the signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez Lopez López, Head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTOV) of the National Institute of Polytechnic (NPI).
The population study (prescribed or not) is invited to participate in MSSI sports centres, which participate in the study, in the Mexico City Valley, where every Saturday will be held from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. tests involving children.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at a sports centre in Kuauthemok (in western Mexico), and that since 8 October events were held at the sports center in Nessaualcootl, Mexico City.
Once the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children has been reached, the study will continue at the sport center of Independence (South Mexico) and finally at the sports centre of Morelos (North Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the complexity and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
November 14 will mark World Diabetes Day and the main goal will be to gather three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with the permission and supervision of parents to complete individual diet questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or heart failure.
On Saturday, he explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist grip), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) would be performed.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just 6 years there had been an increase: in the case of boys, 77 per cent had suffered obesity, in the case of girls 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there had also been a significant increase in the number of women in the period of 6 years, where MSSI was a specialist.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexico was 65 per cent American Indian, 30 per cent European, and five per cent African-born, a condition that affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics was the inability of the body to burn the excess energy we consumed (calories) and that it was deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children who could determine whether they had any weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (accantes) and forearms means that metabolism is likely to be disturbed and even prediabetic.
Information is treated confidentially, and the doctor transmits it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyle to be taken in order to avoid illness.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for causing overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the television, and using transportation on small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. the increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tomatoes, breads, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein, and the genetic bias analysed in the programme.
UNAM Asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM School of Chemistry, developed a polymer-modified bitum to produce a mixture of best quality that is resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If road-covered signals were to be given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits per rainy season in a capital area in the Valley of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a UNAM professor of chemistry, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt road surface is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
His lecture on pits, read during the International Year of Chemistry, reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of near-bitum characteristics, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in areas where the weather was extremely hot, as in some towns in the north, to improve road quality and hence to resist the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil, was a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one a high molecular mass called asphaltenes, and the others a low molecular mass called Maltens, which together gave the road cover to its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The viscous behaviour of a bitumen is the fact that it behaves like a liquid at 120 degrees on high temperatures, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering specialist said.
He observed that Mexico City streets were mainly covered with flexible coatings, consisting of six layers of material, of which the latter three include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones thrown into and then sprayed with bitumen.
Every stone that makes it up, he said, is loaded into a bitumen.
In driving and exerting effort, this helps forces to be very well distributed along the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt covering, he added, the last layer, called the wear layer, which is made of small rock, is actually sand that is also loaded into asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will communicate with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt covering and road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the wear layer also requires proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, because it had a significant impact on the condition of asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, causing all layers of the surface to soften and thus producing pits.
When producing pits, he said, the first person will find a layer of wear and only then will it affect the bitumen, but the damage does not happen instantly, a process that should be taken into account at the first signs of the current repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport loads were another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each surface area must always be related to the transport load and this requirement must be met to prevent frequent pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still much to be learned and done about bitumen, for example, that in other countries were already on the market and even helped to make pits light and without using high temperatures.
What didn't it take for Valle's candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Melina Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Columbia.
The representative of Valle was named Princess at 14 times.
The next time Valle del Cauca, it was only to wish to have the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna was to be content with what was on the podium of winners with silver crowns and tapestry proclaiming her new princess, Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Ms. Atlantic won the crown and the scepter, the department had 14 titled princesses, and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayah (1979), Laurena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Laila Blance (1988), Monika Evers (1989), Maria Sonzuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Heisei Alhore Garce (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garre (2008).
The question that many now ask is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main folktale, which in each statement showed that she had everything she had to become a new Miss Columbian, not simply so she was elected Queen of Police and the most beautiful person on Vogue version, titles owned by the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she failed to answer the question, What book characterizes you and why? by Martin Murilla Gómez of literary society.
She replied to the person asking:
- I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood -- Little Prince -- is a pretty deep book.
Today I read “Prevention and Punishment is a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemiroska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called ‘The Fire of Blood’,
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “culturalization” and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the books cited describes it.
But after Melina’s ceremony, she said that she was calm and at ease with her result: “A man of wisdom, what is to happen is what is to happen.
And all of you, please read a little, 'The little prince's a big book.'
The hypothesis was that Valle was burned up by favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she was given an ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster's culinary contest, the visual vote for the best national suit, and Queen-Mata), which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, caused the queen's stress, and as a result, she did not flash on the stage -
And this was noted during her first appearance at the bather on Hilton beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she both looked confident, it was apparent that she lacked the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, the journalist of the program, the house, on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named Princess meant that a candidate who won more awards during the competition would not become queen.
In addition, the representative Valle had recently avoided contact with the press and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Representative Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the Krasota National Competition.
That is why Lucy Doti, a member of the international jury two days before, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
One beauty is not enough for Ms. Columbia, we have to look not only at the looks, but also focus on the public mind, before they take part in the competition, they have to be involved in the projects -- she said.
It is also suggested that the representative Valle had sinned against the defects in berry and fibrosis that had been seen on her belly, but that was controversial, as the jury had highlighted her as a candidate with natural beauty - taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The consultant to Queen Jorge Hernán Orósco notes that Melina did not have the best body she could have had, but the problems of fibrosis in her stomach, which for me were not very visible, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day -
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of Valle de Cauca was that she had suffered surgery.
-Operations are good, but Valle's representative doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first served by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction was made last night, saying that it was a dowel that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for her lack of pleasure in obtaining the crown.
Whether this is so or not, the fact that Melina has today a year of government, not as queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at an international competition designated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she would enter history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminalist from Cali went into the story of a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Kano.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, CTI's criminalist Cali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Head Alfonso Kano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminals, Elisara González, a 21-year-old man from Puerto Texas, took the turn this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Choko towns, where he often had to walk more than five days through the jungle to reach the location where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valla and after completing his courses, he became a criminist specialist, studying skin friction, that is, lorries and studios.
During the week of Elisar's identification operation known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to wear no more than three days' clothing.
Something big came closer.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Kauk to Palmir.
He knew he would need to identify two corpses, one of which was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo León Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group at the location where the body was located, he did not identify it by outward appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much worse.
But the prints aren't lying.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elisard compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the images.
His eyes weren't set, it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the FARC.
Search for Fingerprints
For a dactyloscopy specialist, Sijin of Cali, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference on the operation against Kano was particularly significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a strict science, without errors, that can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactioscopy professionals are involved in investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and establish the identity of detainees.
When detained, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their prints and look for them in the base.
The researcher said that if he had stolen, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief was holding hands to own a safe full of jewels and money.
“The walls are hard to work with, because they are not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole armour and identify the criminal who's been involved in several thefts -- he says.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with bottles from under the liquor around him was recently found.
During the investigation, it was found that a relative might be suspicious of the crime and, indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A dactylocopy specialist in CTI explained that a chemical or a physical reagent is present at the sites where the prints are available.
When they are displayed, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or are placed on the registry.
The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians, the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the TV program on CSI.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves fingerprints on you.
If possible, however, the comparison is made.
- Disarmed people - challenge the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protesters defeated the camp in front of the Zukkotti Square.
A number of protesters heard the court ' s decision to break the demonstration and went to the park next door.
Members of the movement, Vashti Wall Street, left a challenge to the New York authorities on Tuesday, when they tried to re-enter, under a court order, into Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters were digging into Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get by means of a court order that allowed angry people to break the camp in the square while another part of the movement responded by taking over the park in the north of town where further arrests were carried out
Our idea is that, once the court doesn't allow us to break the camp in the square, we'll break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations.
Bree explained that the response of the angry people to the evacuation of the tent town, which was personally ordered by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the angry people proceeded to invade a new park located on the site of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue central streets, near the entrance of the Holland tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and owned by the arrival of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could hold this place, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters, although Brey couldn't say the exact number but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were handcuffed too.
The Organization believes that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for the members of the movement in an effort to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the area of Zukotti, which is private property, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for Tuesday, which will examine the legality of today ' s morning crackdown on the protesters.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed copies of the court order and even provided copies of them to police officers guarding the area, leading to some minor clashes, Bray said that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The Judicial Order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the movement, taking Wall Street, and forcing the enforcement of the laws that were issued after the invasion, or prohibiting the demonstrators from having access to the park again with the shops and other property used previously.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from deploying tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A member of the Municipal Council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square, carried out at dawn, of an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and this was decided because the protesters violated the law -
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the clearing of the area because it had become a place where people did not come to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people - because - some businesses were threatened - and neighbors feared - for the deterioration of the quality of life -
Evacuation this morning was abhorrent and shows that deep down in Bloomberg there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers - added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for his disregard for freedom of speech -
The responsibility for `Closing Wall Street' also indicated that they intended to organize `border action' on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
With Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the TV program, Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1st.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in \"Bulsh Repair \" , a rescuer at Malibu's Saviours-Banny in-Plebo, Tommy Lee's wife, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private TV CTV has announced today that Anderson, together with the cruiser Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV program, Russell Peters' Day 1st December, as a very special Mary.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for the Internet-wide pornographic video she shows with her then husband, the band drummer, Mötley Crüe - Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary, holding in the pits of Jesus' puppet.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic book of Indian origin who recently appeared as a tour leader, My Cruel Torpeda of Truth, Charlie Shina, appears as Joseph.
In an introduction to Anderson and Peters, Canada's Bubble singer participates in the special Christmas show of CTV, who in late March married Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato, and who knows the same thing about scandals.
Bubble recently named Sukoi, the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall-off that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe carried by the Land of the rising sun since the Second World War.
According to the first estimates of the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that appears to be going on despite the plight of the world.
After three consecutive lost quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September were clearly able to flip the page: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 and represents the fastest growth rate for the Japanese from January to March 2010.
The return may be partly explained by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure, which occurred from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true turning point in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the use of a crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan had awakened, mainly because of household consumption, which now accounted for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This increased by 1% by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Yen glue
Tokyo provided the domestic market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the wares chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone's debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that makes it like a rock on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, goods are expensive to face abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Soni, for example, blame yen for their low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to siege EU peripheral countries, the Eshiiko Noda Government has not diminished vigilance.
We must take note of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said Motohis Furukawa, Minister of Economic Policy yesterday.
And indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
An indicator that predicts fractures in the world economy showed that the main forces were slowing down.
He then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it hit 8 tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Once again gives rise to doubt
Papodimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written obligation
With peripheral risk and uncertainty prizes reigning in the parks, Greece has all continued to wander through the labyrinth, which leads to an end to the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the new Transitional Government of Ella is being imposed more by Brussels than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be supported by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reform and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the conservative party leader - New Democracy - Antonis Samaras - believed that he would not support the new measures of strict economy in any event and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening up parliamentary debates which will be brought to an end tomorrow by a reverend of the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion would be the first innovation.
However, Samaras’s message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The conservative leader took one step more in his sentiments regarding the EU and IMF, organizations that must defuse the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still being irritated by the effects of the allegations of the Papandreau referendum in style, reiterated yesterday that its demands were unequivocal: it would not resume aid if the new Government and leaders of the major parties of Greece did not sign the “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the troika inspectors could, very soon, return to Athens to discuss with the new Government what must be done to pay for the sixth trench — an amount of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been marked.
There's plenty of thread in the Greek club for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: - These are instruments of progress and hope -
The Queen stressed Spain ' s principal place with regard to this type of finance
Spain has taken a prominent place in the world of microfinance -
Queen Sofia reminded us yesterday that in the past two decades, the country had been the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose substance she said was that it was an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity, based on faith in men —
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt that such action is absolutely necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and, especially with a view to halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which poverty is recorded.”
Spain — still working — to expand the network of recipients around the world and to take up this task with full responsibility — says Donja Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women — the main recipients of these loans —
There are many achievements — and many difficulties we face —
The Microcredit Summit becomes not only a ground for dispute, but also a platform that contributes to two basic objectives -
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services, and one hundred million of those households would be excluded from the poverty to which they were immersed.
The momentum for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world followed a path that was launched years ago by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia as an act of justice and recognition.
And she described the father of the instrument as an amazing idealist in the overall fight against poverty -- whose work has been known for 15 years -- since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the ground.
This experience took place a year later at the first World Summit in Washington, D.C. and other meetings, such as those that took place in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and -- everywhere I saw continuous development -- told Her Majesty whose connection to the project was brought yesterday by the title-heads of the family, who were assembled in Valladolid's poor banker --
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling for the participants to participate in the debate and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
- Ethical imperative -
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an ethical imperative for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to the times of the economic boom, since it was a permanent obligation -
Himenes concluded that microcredit entailed a serious and firm course to eradicate poverty -- and now — more than ever developed Governments should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main areas of cooperation for development -
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the success of `to give `confidence' to the men who are divided before whom all the doors are closed ' and the Mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed everyone present in the city, who ' opens his doors with a spirit of solidarity ' .
CHD proposes the election by general vote of the President of the European Commission
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CAC) was held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme, but came about in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are far from strict, as they should today vis-à-vis Greece and possibly tomorrow to Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which was tabled by the Chair, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against the vote and 10 abstained.
Ovations stood for a few minutes, which earned their statements by Angel Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Shoble, the Europhile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea and the draft resolution are expressed in a slogan: the correct response to the crisis is not less than Europe, but more than Europe --
Not only because Europe means peace, but because - nine million jobs depend directly on the euro -
It's time for the chancellor to break through Europe -
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policies of the countries of the EU, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by general vote - to give Europe a person -
In any event, it is one of the proposals of a draft resolution adopted by Congress, which evidently belongs to Wolfgang Schouble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain opposes it, and the HDZ leaders believe that Nicholas Sarkozy is against it too.
But it's the soil that's been prepared.
Likewise, delegates to the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each European Union member country in the European Central Bank government according to the size of each economy, which would have significantly increased the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Colla, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of the small European countries or countries in difficult circumstances, which like to criticize high-level Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted the whole paragraph to the importance of the German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just by passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a sick letter fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the Government launched a hospital attack.
On 15 November, Nicholas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and give a speech on this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
To help this offensive, which has emerged from the desire to save itself in a difficult situation, but also part of the campaign of the right-wing Presidents, most want to concentrate on hospital letters.
First of all, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose the fourth day of unpaid leave on private companies prior to payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without special agreement of the employer, the sick worker will lose his or her salary in four days equal to 15 per cent of his or her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to produce a storm of anger, but which Les Echo reports will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with more symbolic effects, namely, to impose one day on public servants without payment of sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait to pay the benefit, unlike three days of waiting for private sector employees).
At a time when these issues are being discussed, most people are also raising the subject of fraud again with regard to the abuse of hospital letters.
It's going to be more stringent and extra if you're caught, you're going to have to return all the illegal payments you're making -- warning Xavier Bertrand on RTL Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of the sick person's letters.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant scrutiny and political attacks, which bear fruit.
People in France have no more pain than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a first look at the numbers in the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensations were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensation costs in 2008 of Euro11.3 million were 5 per cent of total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were maternity leave and work accidents and 54 per cent were sickness benefits, representing Euro6.2 million.
It therefore accounted for 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management website revealed that 75% of 40,000 French workers interviewed said that they had not taken a hospital in a single day.
Another study on health insurance claims that in 2010 37 per cent of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days before one month, 15 per cent of them between one and three months and 11 per cent longer.
A comparison of these figures with those of the European neighbours shows that French workers are no more inclined to take a hospital than any other country.
A long study by two CNRS researchers in 2010 revealed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall percentage of absences from work in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11% from 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with sick leaves is very low compared with employment.
At the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic screening of patients for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term illness cases were — unjustifiable — or too long — to be 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets, more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were rendered inappropriate or unsubstantiated, which is 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were — not justified — for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, grey numbers -- employment.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report, they ranged from 9,000 to 15,000 million euros of unreceipted budgetary income per year, exceeding the total daily cost of compensation, and thus are endlessly higher than the loss of fraud.
Paradimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos stated this on Monday 14 November in Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not enough to accomplish this task.
In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the real confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October must be a major task, a new Government, since, at the map of the country ' s presence in Eurozón, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit, approximately 9 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Rights Reject the Measures of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of strict economy.
“We will not vote for new measures,” he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenge of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but also with his opposition to any course of economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, who warned that IMF and EU were not blocking the necessary loan of 8,000 euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
There is a need to legalize euthanasia and suicide with outside help, the expert committee declares
Canadians are denied death, as stated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that this is not the case of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code to permit foreign aid and euthanasia for suicide, when this choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death to that of 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is 10 in place, the study notes that the medical treatment of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue on the subject of death -
Whether medically or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, and experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up in hospital.
Quebec is the country's highest, with 86 per cent of deaths in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, with outside help, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and foreign aid suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of the use, i.e., the exercise of euthanasia or suicide, with outside assistance, of persons who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during a teleconference by Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, most of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and foreign suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Foreign suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Joséline Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be borne in mind that 85% of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to the 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe that this will enable people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
66 per cent believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of lesser value.
In the case of people who had assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those surveyed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for patients, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that a legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals train in a spirit of respect for end-of-life medical care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls upon the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to dull the physical pain of euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health legislation expert, described as “the extreme — the position of experts who signed the report, since, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia by deadly cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for assistance in suicide, says meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Desham also emphasized that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that in society there are warning signs and prohibitions.
The Public Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called the “manifest for euthanasia”
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and foreign suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to take power
Damascus condemns “the conspiracy”
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resisted and condemned the conspiracy against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan had favoured the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Assad to take power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime were killed.
“If Bashar had the roads of his country’s interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring Syrian country, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Foreign Minister Achmet Davutoglu of Turkey regretted that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and who could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, with the intention of Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was taking an ever-increasing course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the expansion of consensus against the Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime, following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an ever-increasing course against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime were killed in the Der'a area of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and the shooting of heavy machine guns at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to the ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis -
In addition, he had strongly responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step” -
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this conspiracy against Syria would fail.
After its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, Journalists and Military Observers to be screened into the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Züppe also advocated the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said fell into paranoia.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the recovery plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called yesterday the “incorrect” decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time from markets and Italian victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked markets for a little time to form their team and execute a programme that would require victims to regain the credit capacity lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in a discussion with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats outside the Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber of Deputies said that he would have waited to know whether Mario Monti would have asked Parliament before Friday to vote on trust to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the submission by Mr. Monty of a limited list from a dozen or so ministers, the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
It took time for the Government and the programme to be prepared by democracy, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understood --
His appointment as President was initially approved by markets, but concerns arose again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team, which included most important technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include political -
The new Government would have to act until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to Speaker Janfranco Fini of the Chamber of Deputies, the new Government will receive the Parliament ' s credibility briefing on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would strengthen his job in order to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that \" Despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed -
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not comply with its planned 2013 budget, despite the strict economy plan adopted in recent months, demanded, inter alia, new stricter measures.
Italian-boss boss - Emma Marchegal, who would meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on restarting the economy, because a country that did not have growth could not comply with the deficit -
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), introduced an era change for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a professor symbolizing the seriousness of and, secondly, Italy, according to the authors of the presuppositions.
The longevity of his team was unknown.
The President of Napolitan would be pleased to avoid the early elections, since by April 2012, Italy must pay its public debt payments amounting to 200,000 million euros.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-friendly detonator, confirmed on Monday the United States nuclear-risk agency.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of that United Nations agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
During the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the possible military aspect of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which relies largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danielenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, early in the sixtieths, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamond explosives -
He left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to build a nanoalmaz company in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, until his return to Russia
In its report, the IAEA refers to “substantial indications that Iran’s nuclear detonator system had contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career in the military nuclear programme of his home country”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or did not change.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in Jewish attacks and a 14 per cent increase in religious crime.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3 per cent of which were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
With the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is on the rise again, stresses Human Rights Organization First, - the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant - adding the organization to the official communication.
“Human Rights First long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as serious human rights violations, and Paul Lejander added.
“The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
\" Hatred offences \" , a federal law is the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter is changing its platform and it's becoming like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site has changed the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, inter alia, to see the activity of those they monitor, what makes it look like Facebook.
The new activity tab -- and another name -- allows you to monitor more easily and directly the work of other tweets -- the Internet users whose messages are -- you're tracking, and those who track yours.
This allows them to know if they publish messages if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested - on a small percentage of users in August - before it became widely available all over the network on Monday, stated AFP to the Twitter press secretary Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively relatively incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to pass over someone else's message, #fallowfryday to recommend tracking other users), is mainly a pleasure to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, representing users closer to Facebook and Google+ popular social networks.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of tweets on the Internet.
- It's useless, hardy, too much to remind Facebook -
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream by writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution - golden rule - budget
The leadership of a large coalition of socio-democracy and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided, on Tuesday, to write a budget - gold rule - into a constitution to reduce the fiscal deficit and thus avoid any possible decline in the rankings of Austria's State credit rating agencies (trivial A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faimann personally announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt being 74.6 per cent higher than the 60 per cent ceiling established by the Maastricht Treaty, but less than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest for Euro3,000 million more each year, bringing the argument of Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spingellegger.
Austria is therefore meeting the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State and Government demanded that budgetary deficits be reduced by the end of 2012 and that balanced public accounts be returned through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's regulation recalls the German model - as Germany was the first European country to adopt this - rule -
Until 2017, the structural deficit in the State budget should decrease by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017 the structural deficit in the federal State's budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to make the public debt fall below the figure of 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshiiko Noda
Threats to new intervention in the currency market
Japan's Prime Minister, Eshiiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, to explain it to Mr. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, yen grew almost to a historic mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold its yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, yen has been growing up constantly driven by the purchase of investors, who see it as a safe haven -- in these sad times of the fall of the economy around the world and of the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plank of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro is over 160 yen.
Japanese currency growth is detrimental to Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces Japanese firms ' income from abroad when converted into national currency.
Japan is fighting to rebuild itself, following the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region of the north-east, stressing Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile insecurities of reconstruction.
The world's third largest economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, due to the increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan's \" fundamental economic performance \" .
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened the two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken appropriate steps to ensure that no further mitigation was expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuer increased by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros) to purchase treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) the ceilings that it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to fuel the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates grow, stock exchanges break
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and completed the bid at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Owing to new difficulties in the payment of credit to the eurozone countries in difficult circumstances, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
- Secure investors are just too worried about the risk of infection - explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a 0.7 per cent fall under new market doubts for Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
Japan, like the rest of the world, has held its ground of view in Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a narrow corridor until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized, says Mitsigge Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future eurozone will strike in one currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lower mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency stood at $1.3570, dropping by 0.4 per cent.
The brokers said that it had fallen since the chance of the chance of a country in difficult circumstances leaving the eurozone without leaving the European Union on Monday.
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year bond returns reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish bond returns reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties, with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the exchange time to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of his duty.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the main task of his Government.
Spain was shelled by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Germany and Spain have reached a new historical maximum between interest rates of 10-year debt.
Waiting for growth figures in Eurozone
France recorded a 0.4 per cent growth rate in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 per cent expected due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to a decrease in the figure of the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are more concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded 0.5 per cent growth over the same period.
The first evaluation of the whole eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after brief discussion or under emotion, it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are a cause for reflection on the share and places occupied by nuclear energy.
The resistance will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France must build on objective facts and rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, population development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity permanently, without forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance - a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which is reliant on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one installation to its kit by re-establishing the station, which had been interrupted since the Tri-Myle Island accident.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes used as an example, the validity is contrary to this argument.
Berlin ' s choice would result from an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by an increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a leap in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbine champion, which generated 30% of its electricity, was the same as the largest consumer of coal and gas due to wind breaks, causing carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices to be 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policies, our neighbours pay 40% more than their French households.
Since, in a globalized economy, the price of energy is the key factor in competitiveness and the key to the maintenance of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity available in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory and beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is more so because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of the country made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Largely export-oriented, it attracts a whole pool of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice large quantities of those facilities and lose 6,000 million euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for a period of sixty years if its manufacturer was scheduled to close?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilic sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
The nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents over a period of 50 years.
Only one, Tri-Myle Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any impact on human beings or the environment
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and an uneasy human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented force that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as drawn from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy professionals wishing to build the reactor, the completion of its construction in Flámanville will be a wonderful gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing them the way to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various actors - overloading the police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated to the digital policy and compatibility with the self-proclaimed status of France as a State of human rights -
Then there was the administrative oppression of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of Home Affairs - Liberación - of 23 May) said that France - did not need foreign talents, stones and waitresses -
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and left are in agreement.
The right tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed persons would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers -- but by the left hand side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can’t accept the poor from all over the world”
Difference only in the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of incursion into the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden to the French economy and to French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will be willing to show to immigrants.
In his programme François Olland limited himself to being a banalist, saying that “co-operation will solve our problem of immigration”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarized the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Formed Our World and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University publication, 352 p.m.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
The restriction on immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the perception that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, with a reduction in wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than local workers in carrying out jobs for which there is little local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, but the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A Positive Impact on Wages
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant workers has led immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimated that a 1% increase in the migratory flow would result in a 0.6 to 0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also generate net gains in social security, giving an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant in Germany, for example, arrived at the age of 30, will generate a net profit (income minus expenditure) for his life on an average of Euro150,000.
Nicholas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to go to the toothaches to enter the weak growth points.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to scare immigrants away, had an equally opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, and it remains to reflect European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but also fragile.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that, in order for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies, it would be sufficient to organize the voting and make it as direct as possible.
From Napoleon's time, Malogo knows it's from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal voting, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even be an instrument of repression, as had once been said by Republican philosopher Estienne Vasro.
No, democracy requires much more — public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but above all it is the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodity of the true and false Greek referendum will have a double disclosing effect, showing both the need for a major change of policy and the unpleasant perception of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be thought out in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now gone down and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong side.
We will not win by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
- Cart Blanche - for an absolute European monarch or jumps with tied legs in the wake of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of the lesion of the guillotine, but of the realization of a common, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and we don't know how many others will have to be listed because there is only one crisis in Europe.
Europe is fully subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, its weakness and its lack of solidarity.
Europe has been completely downgraded on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The administration of the European project, under popular sovereignty, must be restored as a matter of urgency.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce everyone's debt, break free from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Breaking out of the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without causing us disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, socialists and Jacques Delor now require a European economic government.
That's right.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into play is another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create the Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine popular European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Map Exhibition was held on Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end up with 11% of the world’s sales of micro-processors (bank cards, SIM cards) exceeding Eurosmart’s 6,000 million.
Most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows public transport or purchase to be paid by simply drawing a map over the reading device.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to nearly 10 per cent of the world card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which had long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, was now moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards have already been delivered and 75,000 terminals are accepted.
France is starting from more modest positions, with 400,000 contactless Visa cards in circulation.
But big shops are getting faster.
This year Carrefour produced 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard.
Banks must supply the equipment of their clients in order to speed up.
Two large organizations in France promised that they would systematically distribute to their clients bank cards designed for contactless use, according to Gérard Nebui, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first step in developing the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, few machines have been equipped with NFC technology (Customization of the Near Field) necessary for such transactions.
- They were postponed.
- But they have to really fly out next year.
We are counting on world sales from 80 million to 120 million units in 2012, explained by Mark Burten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, the Crédit Agricole announced that the experiment had been conducted from December to June next year in Qana.
The iPhone's approximately 200 clients and staff will be supplied with contactless cheques.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And Société Générale also told yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Saharan Africa to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect, Boko Haram, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now sure of that.
“The means used by these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating, he explained without resorting to details.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in the Niger in January revealed two links.
The kidnappings in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Wenson Delori are likely to have been killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special units.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone symmetries belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the calls took place indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has lived long in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a cradle of Boko Haram, and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
- This is a step forward, but no doubt we have to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram
- But it's possible -
“For many years, it has been known that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident by the actions and statements of Boko Haram and by her methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, D.C., is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people who are not of interest.
Rapid Success
Founded in 2002, in Maidiguri at a mosque, school and with an imam-fundamentalist, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, what the Western education of House means is a sin, and preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It was politicized and required strict respect for the Sharia, and its activists were fighting against the wicked central government.
It focuses primarily on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists at Boko Haram were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
The Abuja reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern scene.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in José and then one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local office of the United Nations will be their first international target.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, when the Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger, and the Somalis from Al-Shabaab act in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week during a discussion with Presidents Goodlock, Jonathan Allen Juppe warned about the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The world as the Republican presidential candidates see him
With regard to China, Iran and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis - weakened America pursue a complex world with simple and more precise simplified ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the loud but unexpressed statement on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
The losunges of China, Iran and Israel often mix with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving away from the \"Old Good Party\", threatened to bring a complaint to WTO on the Chinese and to accuse them of manipulation of his currency, was a sensitive subject for America, angered by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate on complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome an emotional attitude.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who holds on to the bottom of the ratings, remains unheard of.
In the Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear program.
- If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran,
- If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb -
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance by accusing Obama of not fulfilling his promises to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, showed a disappointing ignorance of the cases.
He recently called for a fight against the Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power — obviously not knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the United States Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of suspects of terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman.
It's all very far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They remind him that Obama was a lover himself and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the boys, from Iraq, his fables in Libya, who have given him the reputation of a weak policy.
But the attack is not so simple.
The population considered the balance of national security at Obama to be positive, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention, which links it in the sand.
And, in claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to re-establish its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new Russian gas entrance gate to Europe.
The North Stream gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly across the Baltic Sea is launched.
It is designed to supply an equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
Over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra and the snacks, the opening of the North Stream, the new gas pipeline, which directly links Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon, and his Dutch colleague, Martha Rütte, together, returned a symbolic vent that controlled the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
A new gas pipeline of 275,000 million additional cubic meters of gas will reach Western Europe every year on the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting Leningrad to the land of Mecklenburg-Memerie.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to France ' s total consumption.
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The draft met with bitter opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream would indeed allow the gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power; they will find it more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense point, Warsaw's debate did not stop before the North Stream comparison with the new \"Germano-Sowet Pact \" , which aimed at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the question is politically sensitive.
In supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the price of Europe's loss of energy, because the project created a hole between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to gain its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas and whose own reserves are already on their way.
- This gas pipeline, part of cooperation with Russia, is a new artery that organically binds us - it was claimed by François Fión, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important, politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the heads of Gazprom, which were present in large numbers in Ljumin, the arrival point of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is made of steel trapped in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 metres.
To build it, the minefields remaining since World War II had to be bypassed.
\"One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,\" said Jens Muller, the North Stream press secretary.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, with no breaks throughout it, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not happy that a Russian government company would live on its shores forever.
- In the event of an accident, we'll close the gas flow in less than a minute - says Jens Muller.
So, if you leak the gas in the pipeline, it'll go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to be the designers who designed the stitches, designed only to flow once every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship, for external observation, and by a apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
A cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted inside a 1 meter diameter pipeline and pushed forward by a gas stream.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of the gas shall be carried out only at the pressure of the gas.
It is 200 bar when shipped and 100 bar when arrived.
Five companies combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called the North Stream, which was responsible for constructing and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years, with the possibility of extending the total volume of gas.
“Gazprom will pay for its full volume, no matter how much gas is actually to be transported,” argues Jens Muller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be 7,000 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investments will be around 240 million.
But the minor shareholders are confident that they will pay off their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The gas pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Ljumin on a sandy shore with pine trees.
The valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas output terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before they can be pumped into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It's going to be 3 million per hour in full power and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand Notepad
Moleskine, established by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return to the taste for writing.
He has an adventure scent, hours behind the letter in the light of candles.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to know on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber line, on yellow and white pages, as if it were yellowing over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell the design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a company consultant, assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The note is inspired by old production techniques, shellfish, and lacquered cotton cloth, such as that used to cover the scams.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
Moleskine brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that had been a cult for the Avanguardist artists until the 20th century, told Maria Sebregondi, who had since become the management brand in Modo.
Good luck.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 25% to 12.7 million.
We left far behind the production of the first years when only 3,000 notes were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting up a typical buyer's profile is hard because the notebook is equally attractive to a businessman, a student, and a freeman.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, widely viewed and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spreads its notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in small-town centres, and has been able to become widely known.
“We have followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the appearance of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregundi.
This characteristic cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently set up an Explosion - The Environment Way - where architects and artists have displayed their own notebooks.
In August he also launched cover with leopard painting on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine has a variety of products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brands, which include all kinds of support.
Success, which gave birth to envy: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, which included a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled persons begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice the average, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Are you kidding me?
- No, - stresses Eric Blanche, Adapt Director General, an organization that organizes a week ' s employment for persons with disabilities -
- Considerable progress has been made in 15 years -
♪ At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times greater ♪
- There's a lot of work ahead of you -
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them are more elderly: 37 per cent over 50 years of age (17 per cent average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, is very common, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria make it very difficult to return to work, which is the essence of the problem — according to Christian Grapen, Director-General of Tremlin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about the mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study by the IMS-Entreprendre Association, commissioned by Cité in April, showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and were representing full-time people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled persons.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers, as set out in the Act of 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
- Today we're about 3% - - says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agency, an organization responsible for tax collection from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of non-budgeted organizations, as well as the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from €606 to €480 million).
- The Law of 2005, which taxed, put a heavy pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with employees between 20 and 49 have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 and 199 employees.
Azar: “What happiness -
Before fighting the blue night on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We're not going to say that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Seated near the foot of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after his match-attacker against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
- I'm very pleased with Eden, with his progress and with the fact that he's Belgian.
- I want to go further, - the player Lille is assured.
As to the contrast between his achievements at the club and the assembly, it's one whole, it's justified.
- I'm in Lille for a year, and Belgium doesn't.
- I have to earn my glasses.
Abandoned, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St.
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure -
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
- I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of the match.
And especially what is on the other side of Matthia (Debush), Johan (Kaba) and Adil (Rami), he remembers.
♪ Just our roads crossed ♪
♪ Having the opportunity to play against them is pure happiness ♪
Leekens made good mention of pride -
♪ Horror ♪ Play in the late match ♪
“Hardness — also to claim as a neighbour — that France has once again become a very high-level team — just one year after the injury in Naizne.
Loran Blanc was like a thunder strike, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the tech athlete will fly in one plane with the Blues leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
\"Our little Belgians are growing\" he stressed.
- We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
- See for yourself in future matches, including this one against France -
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal, Paulo Bentto, is launching its response against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) on Tuesday, in Lisbon, with great optimism.
On his way, the two teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
- By the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country -
Paul Bentou has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the Sborna, with which he has been in control since September 2010, is a Euro 2012.
Portugal's only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia has to win.
Taking into account the fact that it is clear on Friday, 0-0 on Anja Zenica, on Friday, that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve a willful goal that would calm it down.
“This is a good result, however, which entails a certain risk”
But at his brightly lit stage in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which is to be delighted, even though the match will be very tense.
“We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced we can win,” said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
- We still have 50 percent chance of being in Euro 2012 - the successor of Carlos Keiros has.
On Friday, the match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
The Bosnians could've built nothing.
- It's a good result, but it's a risk, but it's a pity for Bent.
- We'll play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and players that have a lot of individual qualities - he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are about to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, not to give them time to meditate.
It's a good idea, just this time it's realistic.
