Wells Assembly members are concerned that they will “associate with mappers”
The recommendation to change the name of their office to a “member of Parliament of Wales” (MWP) is shocking for some.
This was because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to \"Parliament of Wales\".
ALTHOUGH the political spectrum is concerned that it may provoke ridicule.
One layman claimed that his group was disturbed by the Twp and Pwp swarms.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, \"twp\" means \"twp\" and \"pwp\" means act of defecation.
THE Wells Party stated that its group as a whole was \"unsatisfied\" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said that his group was open to changing the name, but he pointed out that MWP could quickly become a \"muppet.\"
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter \"w\" is similar to the word \"u\" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change its names, noted: “The remaining decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Wells Self - Government Act of 2017 gives Wells Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published a public discussion of proposals, and the re-enactment of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales was widely supported.
As for what is called the CHA, the commission proposes to call them \"Members of Parliament of Wales\", or WMP, but the MWP has received the most public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems for the chairman, Elaine Jones, who has to submit a bill of change for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the exclusion of CHA and the structure of the committee system.
IT IS a final vote on their new name when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The voting was organized to resolve a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim for Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the voting results.
However, supporters of a referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that a change of name is simply a price to pay for entry into the EU and NATO.
Saint-Marten's bells are silent, because Harlem's churches are going through difficult times.
“The old people I talked to said that there was a bar and a church at every corner before, ” relates Mr. Adams. “
There's no one or the other now.\"
He feels that the disappearance of the bars is clear:
\"In our time, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the kind of local living room where they regularly go.\"
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from selling assets is not as long as leaders expect, and “it's early or late to be where they started”.
The churches, he added, could replace homes with condominiums, and there would be people who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“ The vast majority of the people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close up, since it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condominiums will become their inmates. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and St. Martin was built ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The local black community was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem Main Street, and they didn't want to hire blacks and raise them by service.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by the fire, but the parishes of Father Johnson wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson’s father in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor. ”
An expert who played the carillion in July called it another: \"cultural treasure\" and \"an indispensable historical instrument.\"
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the first carillion in the world to be played by Black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who had passed over to a larger carillion in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveser said he had no replacement in St. Martin.
What's going on in St. Martin in the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which were engaged by church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, which is made up of world leaders, wrote a diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on expenses” to the council, and that the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some churchgoers complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old boy who dived behind the browsters in California
Officials say that on Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy, and the boy dived behind the browsters in California on the day of the opening of the browster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. at the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and the group sailed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill for a caught browster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!\"
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his key was completely broken.
“ I cried out to all of them to get out of the water, ‘ In the water of the shark, ’ ” adds Hammel.
The boys were taken to the council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Jayles on the bridge for the media told us that a few weeks ago, a shark was noticed in the area, but it was found not to be dangerous shark species.
Jayles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper body.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities closed their access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Jayles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's are going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics like the ones in the department store. Working on the islands will be skilled sellers.
As part of the increased output of £2.8 billion in the British cosmetic market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods go down, the increased cosmetic islands will be protested in 11 shops across the country, and in the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will show up in other shops.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use a political space that used to be used under televisions, microwave ovens, and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that they would double the cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees are going to get more space: brand areas like the ones in shops like Boots are going to appear.
The Supermarket also updates the Boutique Cosmique: now most of the goods presented will not be tested on animals, which young buyers are increasingly demanding.
Besides, Fragrance Shop, a retailer for perfumery, protests his trays at two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opens at Croydon, northern London last week, and the second opens at Selli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and switching to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coup, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like a department store, because the supermarket network was trying to resist Aldi and Lidl discs with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's are opening up Argos offices in hundreds of their shops, and there's also a number of Habitats departments open up, and Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and said it increased sales of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade cosmetics and pharmaceutical products had failed.
Sainsbury's were tested for collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but she ended up arguing about how to split the revenue from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacies (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help with the addition of the extended skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichi, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said, \"We've changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could offer advice.
The variety of brands that we present is designed to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is the competition of the old way of buying.\"
Peter Jones is \"sluffed\" because Holly Willowby is out of the 11 million pound sterling deal.
The dragon league star, Peter Jones, is \"thrown\" because Holly Willoughby's TV driver has come out of agreement with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is £11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoubi has no time for branding Truly's home clothes and accessories.
The couple's business was connected to the Goop Gwinnet Peltrow brand.
A 37-year-old program leader named This Morning announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones to the story of Peter Jones, when at the last moment he left their lucrative business goods for life to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is \"scattered\" when a gold girl on TV confessed during an intense meeting on Tuesday at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth £1.5 million means that she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their common brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
This business was connected to the Goop Gwinnet Peltrow brand and had to double Willowby's fortune, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported to Instagram going from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation houses.
The source said: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
He would be its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willouby’s decision to quit business shocked all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday almost before the launch.
At Marlowe's headquarters, there's a whole warehouse ready for sale.
Experts believe that the host's entrance, one of Britain's most highly paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes) and create further delays with launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three of Willowby’s children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby and Kappa created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couples held the celebration together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin’s television company.
Willoubi will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartin as lead I'm A Celebration with ITV.
The source approached Jones said last night, \"We're not going to comment on his business.\"
Hard talk, \"and then we're in love\"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would regard as a “non-resident” and also for the very positive attitude that North Korea’s leader would take.
“ Why did President Trump make such a big move? ”
said Trump, simulating the voice of the news leader. — See the box on page 7.
I didn't make any concessions.\"
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a leading North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the United States in its first steps of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues its sanctions to support the pressure.
The Trump was much more optimistic in giving a talk on his rally.
“ We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have such a wonderful relationship.\"
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of the missile tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
\"It's so easy to behave in a presidential way, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this hit stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,\" Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed an island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lomboch earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboka were affected, the national catastrophe was not announced, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, a team is assembled to travel to Pala until it is known whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a member of a national disaster management agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that earthquakes are constantly taking place in Indonesia, the country remains extremely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh province, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
Although warning of the tsunami in Pala was likely effective, the siren’s absence apparently contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the multitudes of Indonesian islands is not easy, even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboch to treat earthquake victims sails to Pala, but reaching the site of a new disaster will be a minimum of three days later.
President Joko Wydodo made improvements in Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, who is planning to move on next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by long-standing interfaith strife in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of them from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was killed
Investigation into the murder began after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Mercsaid, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stun wounds at Grayson Mouss, John Street, a 32-year-old man suspected of being killed.
The police called for the response of people who had seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: \"The investigations are now in the early stages, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxisters, who could take something to the video register, to contact us, because the information on these videos can be very important to our investigation.\"
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in a house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman arrive at the scene of crime to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing, and the police have said that they are now informing the immediate relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mouss, had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that no one was allowed to go to and leave the house.
When he learned what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Now residents are told that they will be allowed to return home for hours.
Someone heard a policeman tell one man that the whole district is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene of the crime.

Statue Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from a \"history rewrite\"
The removal of the statue would be a credit for the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which brought his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community called Mr. Crick's suggestion \"stupidness\" and \"to try to rewrite a story.\"
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said, \"In view of the current debate about the removal of statues, the fact that Oliver Cromwell's statue at Westminster Palace will be the target was inevitable.\"
The iconoclastic work of the English civil wars was not done either by Cromwell or by order.
Cromwell is likely to be offered undeservedly in behalf of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, sculptor William Hamo Torneikroft, is a 19th-century testimony to the mood and part of the historiography of the figure, which many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph, \"Many people, probably more in the late 19th century than they do now, consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — an object of historical debate that persists?
There is no doubt that the mid - 17th - century conflict has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures representing one side of the conflict.
His achievements as a protector Lord should also be celebrated and honored.\"
Killer pig destroyed Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the nickname Yuan was found dead in the blood with a torn artery near a piggyback on the market in Liupanshui, province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is about to immunize pigs in a pig - eater.
On Wednesday, he is reported to have left his cousin in the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigstand was open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big cab with blood on its mouth.
Medical forensics confirmed that 249 kilograms of cockroach had destroyed the farmer until his death.
\"My cousin's feet were in blood and distorted,\" said a cousin named Wu who had been quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record showed that the Yuan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuana or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked in to prevent its attack on people.
Seven I-Juana and the market administration are said to discuss compensation for his death.
Although rare, the attacks by pigs on humans were still recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man a serious injury.
Ten years before the pig weighed 295 kg, it kept the Welsh farmer pressed against the tractor until the farmer’s wife was frightened by the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could become a \"triger.\"
\"They're just playful.
They're like kids who're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect, ” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring massive rainfall to the southwest United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to weaken, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rose will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (that's a hurricane of category 1) at 5 a.m. in Eastern time on Sunday, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a rainstorm that moves east to the west coast of the United States, and as Rose approaches the lower coast of California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin pushing strong tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring rain to 25.4 inches [25.4 cm] in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching valley will produce heavy rains in the southwest.
From 2.54 to 10.2 inch [2.52 cm] of rain in this area will cause dangerous torrential floods, garbage streams, and the potential for landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will increase rainfall to between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 - 10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Flood floods are possible because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to walk to the desert because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make the canyons a stormy river, and storms can bring stormy winds and dust storms.
Rainfall will cause heavy rain in some parts of the northern coast of California.
Precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause invigorating streams of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain shower in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
The heavy rain will go over the For-Corners from Tuesday through Wednesday.
In October the intense temperature swings throughout the United States may be observed, as the Arctic is colder, but the Tropics remain warm enough.
This can lead to rapid temperature swings on short distances.
Sunday is a fine example of a sharp temperature swing in the central United States.
It's almost a 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De-Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer’s warmth will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that there will be heat up to October in a large area in the center and east of the United States, and the temperature from the south plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesdays, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term forecast of weather, there is a high probability of an excess of average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Bretta Cavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks observed the thrilling testimony of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of the sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, and the canals interrupted planned programs to report the latest news on Friday, a treaty prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week prosecution investigation by the FBI.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had dressed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure he wasn’t there.
It's likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching this, as reported by the Nielsen Research Company.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
I couldn't get numbers on other networks right away that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, such an audience is about the size of an audience watching a play play-off or Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose leading opinion show strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader among all the channels during a listening period that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen says that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, CNN has 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican announced that he would vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras were recorded as protesters were shouting at Flake when he was trying to drive an elevator to hear the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was offended, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?
They said to him: “You have authority, and many women are powerless. ”
Flake reported that his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee’s hearing.
All cable and wide channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the promotion of Cavanaugh's candidacy to vote to the Senate in full.
Flake said he'd do it only if he knew the FBI would consider the charge against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flake has been partially convinced to talk with his friend, Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice was influential because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of playing politics around Brexith
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to quit the European Union of “policy games” with future Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to Theresa's interview on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Chakers plan for Brexith, saying that it was \"absolutely absurd\" to suggest to Britain and the EU that the customs of each other should be drawn \"absolutely absurd.\"
Who Shooted Wade Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of dying a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspected gunman who caused the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
A 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder charges, and stated in the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and the police claimed that Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
According to WAFB, an affiliated CBS TV channel, police removed glasses from the scene and noted that they had found DNA from Simpson.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was granted a bail of $350,000.
The Office of the Coronor of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation to the special police unit in Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, the South University Police and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
The sports director at Louisiana State University, Joe Allev, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “emergence and the pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Ford grew 198 cm tall in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 picking.
Friday morning a basketball coach at Louisiana University, Will Wade, said that the team was \"fought\" and \"skinned\" by Wade's death.
\"That's what's bothering you all the time,\" said Wade.
The volcano throws out ash on Mexico City
The ashes that eject the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater had become active and had 183 gas and ash emissions recorded in 24 hours.
The center followed many noises and spurs.
The photos on social networks show thin layers of ash on the forehead of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Bakimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcano activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following a 7.1 - point earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Hoyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists the day before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protesters encountered a special police unit, thousands of people joined the protestors' demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalonia voting on separation.
A pro-separatist group in masks held by special appointees threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The police used sticks to contain aggression and later the day.
A few hours later, an independent group who had scanned for \"Don't forget, let's not forgive!\" came across supporters of the preservation of the country who were shouting, \"Let's live Spain!\"
According to a report in the local press, fourteen people were helped with the minor injuries suffered during protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal but noted by the Catalan separatists, the tension in a region that desires independence remains high.
The voters usually voted for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of those who opposed the separation were boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region.
Groups of independence spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to take a different route.
68-year-old Narcissa Termes, an electrician who was involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“We have experienced one of our greatest moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end,\" he said.
Despite the vital but highly complex victory of the regional elections last December, the Catholic parties in charge of independence were unable to maintain the momentum this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in a voluntary exile or a prison waiting for a court to participate in organizing a referendum and further declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested police support for the phone, claimed that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
\"The tension is increasing,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in the tracking insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be chatting the next year to the European Parliament.
“The status of the candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
The men were arrested after the car drove into the house.
Three men at 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after the car entered the building several times in London.
The incident occurred on Ballinagard Cressent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house were damaged.
It may well be that at some point a car was fired from an arbolette.
The Menga hit ensured the Livingstone victory over Rangers with an account of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingston became victorious
Leverington's promoted class has shocked Rangers and brought to Stephen Gerard a second defeat from 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox club.
The impact of Dolly Menga was crucial, with Gary Holt's team rising to one level from Hibernian in a second.
Gerardo's team won't win this season's premiere weekend, and next Sunday's is playing with the Harts leaders, who have eight points away from them.
Before that, Thursday Rangers would accept the Rapid Vienna as part of the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Loveston continues his invincible move to six games in the division, and Chief Coach Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses out on the odds that he's given to infirm guests.
Holt's team had to be ahead long before they got killed, because they're directly creating Rangers, all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence, but took a blow along the gate, then Alan Letgo swung past the gate after confronting himself and took the blow of Craig Halkett along the gate that he had made his head.
The stewards were satisfied with what they had allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems for standard guests.
That's how the decision goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Menga, who took the ball and killed from the center of the penalty.
Until this stage, Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the protection of the masters of the field proved impracticable and Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was largely unsettling.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did succeed in striking in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman hit Alan McGragree with his feet on a hooker called the Rangers.
The raids were regularly sent to the Livingston Penalties and constantly neutralized, and two toolbar applications — after the Halkett attack on Glenn Middleton, who replaced it and at hand — were rejected.
The Livingstone Phenomena: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
The phenomenal play and the outcome of Livingston.
All of them played perfectly, and they kept out of expectation on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of playing and composition did not change much after returning to the highest level, but Holt was to be commended for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grand, very well organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the direction of Gerard, but now they don’t get much involved.
They lacked the last ball -- only once they had breached the authority of the masters of the field -- and that was a kind of awakening for Rangers that ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogans were taken to Cologne several times
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there were smiles and blue skyscrapers.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have raised some controversy over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Then Erdohan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey.
For reasons of security, the police did not let 25,000 people gather before the mosque, but many presidential supporters did appear near to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear — they condemn Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests reveal the ambiguity of a visitor named by some German Turks as a hero and others as a dictator.
Depford Road Crash: A cyclist died in a car collision
A bicycle was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Bestaud Street and Evelyn Street crossing on a chewing road in Deptford area in southeast town about 10:15 a.m. in British standard time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This accident occurred months after another cyclist died after escaping from an adventure in Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police said that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
The bus routes are not allowed, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: six jailers injured in riots
Six of the prison staff were injured by the men's prison break-in, and the prison administration reported.
Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison riot in Woostershire began at about 09:30 a.m. in British standard time on Sundays and is still going on.
In order to stop the riots initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit called the Tornados.
The officers were provided with medical care for the light trauma of the face they received at the scene.
The prison official commented: \"In order to resolve an incident in Her Majesty Long-Lartin Prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six co-workers received medical care for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and that their detention may be prolonged.\"
In Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison, over 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had been sent to the stationery after the prison attack.
Last October, a police unit was called into prison to stop the serious disturbances that the prison guards had been assaulted with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods.
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen early the following week, as the remainder of Hurricane Rosa is heading through the southwest desert to risk floodwaters.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of torrential flooding on Monday and Tuesday, from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and on Monday evening, it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Fenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of the Phoenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of Arizona’s border.
According to the latest projections of the National Center for Storms, the area of the Mogolon Rome in Arizona is predicted to be between 5.08 and 10.16 cm, and the locations are expected to be 15.24 cm.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, possibly as many as 10.16 cm.
Where floods are not at risk, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
While floods are a very serious problem, some of these showers are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Centre, a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s land area suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest drought category, reportsweather.com.
First, the path to Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, on Sunday morning, in a hurricane with a maximum wind velocity of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets with more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and thus weakens.
Thus, a tropical storm is expected to cause a shift in Mexico during or on Monday night.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
“The total rainfall expected from Lower California to Northwest Sonora is between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm, ” reportsweather.com.
Rosa will then go north across Mexico as a tropical storm, get Arizona’s border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and will reach southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The basic dangers expected of Rose or her remains are heavy rains in Lower California, northwest Sonori, and southwest American desert, ” reports the National Center for Storms.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and streams of garbage in the deserts, as well as to landslides in a mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested and attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old man with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Exelsior Terras area at Midsomer Norton about 04:00 a.m. at the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock district, reported to the Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh was \"tolerated by the polity and anger\" of the Democratic Party
“The voice behind Judge Kawano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump on the rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had “tasted the zeal and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the promotion process.
Cavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday, violently and emotionally denying Christine Blazey Ford’s accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of the charges she had raised.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliantness, character, and courage of the Cavanaugh. ”
“The voice behind Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most successful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with the impeccable experience of the public service, ” he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president side-by-side mentioned the promotion of Cavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans appearing in medieval elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
“ I don’t run, but I really run, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.\"
Trump argued that the democratic mission was to “oppose and hinder”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Qavano candidate will take place not later than Friday, informing CNN of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds died as a result of an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties increases
At least 384 dead, many washed away in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six feet (18 m) at dusk broke ashore, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami took place after a 7.5 - point earthquake.
“When tsunami threat arose yesterday, people still engaged in their business on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they became victims, ” said a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
\"It wasn't just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on the land,\" said Nugroho, adding that before it hit the shoreline, the tsunami went through the open sea at 800 km/year (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, and he added.
Some 1,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned out and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
Posters in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb energy dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow cove, could have contributed to the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide - scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found in the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
\"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we received no information\" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and his staff and volunteers are added to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received extensive criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had struck Pala, even though officials said that the waves had come at the time indicated in the warning.
The amateur footage shared by people on social networks shows a man on the top floor of the house sounding out a loud warning of the approaching tsunami on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water broke into the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the integrity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious power cut that was turning off the link around Pala, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military officials began sending freight planes from Jakarta and other cities, and they informed the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other essential items.
The city’s airport was opened for help, and it would be closed until October.
President Joko Wydodo was to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
The World Vision co-workers from the Donggals successfully reached the city of Palu, where they hide in the tarpaulin tents set up in the yard of their office, but on their way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
“ They told me they had seen many destroyed houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams were determined to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Pala with much experience.
Under Indonesian rules, financing, provision and supply of personnel from abroad can begin only if the disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ This is still a provincial catastrophe, ” noted Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, \"Okay, that's a national catastrophe, we'll be able to accept international aid, but this status is not yet granted.\"
On the second night, it came down on Pala after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families who had not yet been found still hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle that would embellish these grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was received from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers received a woman who lay two days under the stones along with her mother’s body next to her mother.
Hendon Subandano, a coach at the Indonesian National Paraplanerism Team, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanetists who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among a group of paraplanetists, he desperately sent reports on WhatsApp to the rivals of Paul who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with just one gray, not a double blue.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered, ” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 when the ATM came back to Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink, who sent an ATM to Newport on the Levee, reported in news to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car cleared the ATM and was preparing to add more money, writing to Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man \"run his back to workmate Brink\" and stole a bag of money intended to be replenished.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the scene of the crime in the news, but the police did not specify the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these individuals should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Y.
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Y.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “formerly officially known as Kanye West.\"
The 41-year-old West was called the Y, and he used this abbreviation as the name for his album, released in June.
There was a change on the eve of his show on Saturn Day Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Ariane Grande's singer, who cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons”, the author of the show reported.
Not only was this a contraction of the present professional name, West once said that it had a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that ‘ is the most common word in the Bible, ’ and in the Bible it means ‘you’, ’ ” said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radioman called Big Boy. “
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canier, meaning “single, ” has been reduced to simply an E — just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusing, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.\"
Kanyier is one of several well-known rapers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deaddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Lav and Braser Lav.
West's former colleague, JAY-ZI, was also experimenting with defis and capital letters.
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
The New President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of the students.
On Saturday, in the square of Tlatelolco, Lopez Obrador promised to \"never use an army to suppress the Mexican people.\"
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration into the square, killing about 300 people, and leftist student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who were studying and by opening more free government universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities brought young people into criminal gangs.
US needs to double finance in artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount they spend on research in this field, they think of an investor and practice in AI Kai Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after different parts of the U.S. government made an application for the AI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become no.1 by innovation in the AI field by 2030.
“The dual budget for the AI study would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind in the United States, and we are preparing for the next AI breakthrough,” said Lee.
Double funding can double the likelihood that the next major achievement in the AI area will be made in the United States, said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book The AI State: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of China’s most famous AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he was working on an AI system that cost the best American player in Otello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win public grants, says Lee.
\"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's a corporation,\" he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years employed lights from universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the area of AI.
\"I believe that Green Card needs to be automatically offered to candidates of science in the field of AI,\" he said.
China’s National Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding for academic workers, just like the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, and the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic circles partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next Initiative.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, he is now investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to establish a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has taken no steps for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of the country to “The Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, claims that the northern neighbor’s name is a claim for its territory, and vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments agreed on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalistic opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has declared that he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the vote will reach a minimum of 50%, who will allow the referendum to be held valid.
The issue in the referendum bulletin is: “Are you in support of NATO and EU membership when you enter into an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that has formed since the fall of Yugoslavia, should pay to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young men of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgevski in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, you're going to need two thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission claimed that there were no reports of a violation by 1 p.m.
However, the appearance was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters dropped their ballot papers.
\"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,\" stated 62-year-old elector Gyoze Tanevski in Skopje's capital.
On September 30, 2018, Zoran Zayev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, and his wife Zorika and his son Duško, gave their vote in a referendum on a change in the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to enter.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through a service door,” said Kvardarkov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority vote is for the EU and NATO,” said Zayev after the vote.
He noted that the result of yes would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required appearance.
According to another study conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% claimed to vote in favour.
In order for a referendum to be recognized as valid, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western government since its start in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, of Manchester City, goes through the entire Briton defence and strikes a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were defended by Briton and brought the Manchester City victory with an account of 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Aguero, on the 65th minute of the match, looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Briton's three defenders and found himself in an open field.
Aguero further realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then ran a couple more at the edge of the criminal Briton.
Then he left the pass, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the fine to hand over the ball to Aguero, who, by his right-hand butt, launched it into the right-hand side of the gate, defeating the brayton needle player Matt Ryan.
\"Aguero has some foot problems,\" said the manager of City to the journalists, Pep Guardioll.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That was the case.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment.\"
But the original advantage of the sky-blue in this prime league match was to provide Sterling.
This goal took place at 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Briton.
He sent a beautiful, permeable pass along Leroy Sane's left flank.
Leroy made a few touch and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of his long pants.
The sky-blocking form threw the ball into the gate just before it slipped outside.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhine Neckcar Arena Stadium in Zinzheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take his points to Rockis.
Since the Washington Nasnals team came out of the playoffs, there was no reason to wait for another start.
But the rival Sherzer is hoping to go to the pitcher's bitters on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockis on the condition that Rockis will still have trouble going to play off. Now, Rokes is one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rockis has at least a Wild Card for winning with a 5-2 score over the Nashionals on Friday night, but still wants to secure the title of the first Division.
\"Although we play for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how to behave here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've seen in all this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
The Nashionals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but they say they are leaning towards being Schercer.
Sherzer, for whom it's going to be the 34th, on Thursday he took a pitch session, and he can play Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington, D.C., has a score of 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strike auths at 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump Mitings in West Virginia
The President kindly referred to the situation around his candidate for the Brett Kavano Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' appearance in the middle-term elections.
\"All that we have done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big ones -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm everywhere I can, fighting for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump went on, \"You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they're firmly set to regain power using whatever means you're using, you see undergarments, scumbags.
They don't care who's suffering, who needs to get over it, to gain power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them.\"
The mission of the Democrats, he said, \"to confront and hinder.\"
“And you see it during the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘wicked and mean, indecisive and lying.’
He mentioned the Judicial Committee of the Senate, calling the Democrat Senator Diane Finestein by name, which caused the audience to cry out in a loud voice of frustration.
\"Remember her answer?
Did you submit a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad body language -- the worst bodywork language I've ever seen.\"
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
In it it is insolent to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last member of Parliament to be told that they're not welcome, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my Parliamentary colleague, was treated almost similarly because of her firm stand against anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report of the Nottingham East Labourers on Friday says, \"We want meetings to be inclusive and productive.\"
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament were like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more kind, more softer” policy has long since been forgotten, if ever at all.
It's becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party has no different opinions and that every opinion is valued from the position of whether or not it's acceptable to lead the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues with whom I thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether it's national security or the EU's only market.
Always, when I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it's followed by a tingling of attacks on social networks, calling for revocation, condemning the politics of the center, I'm told I shouldn't be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm lucky enough than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been given are usually political.
I am thrilled by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the tides of sexist or racist attacks every day, but who will never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every move of the \"failure\" or a change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice, and I have been urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly, that ‘ everything is fine. ’
But I didn't come into politics.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because because of the lack of government attention, my class in high school has literally collapsed, since then I want to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it be a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday events, I only want to say one thing: as the country goes to Brexith, which is going to harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, not for Nottingham's Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats to revoking me or any political gain will prevent me from acting in line with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air rises
Two recent attempts may have distorted the final outcome, but no doubt Air earned triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match of Premier Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, that's the only unconquered team of ten.
After all, Peter Merchi’s excellent defense and improved ability to use the odds give owners and coach all the right to be content.
“ So far we have been through the trials of our games, and we are still invincible, so I must be content, ” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, \"I give it back to Eyre -- they've used it better than we do.\"
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, as implemented by France Klimo, led the Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed Melrose to display numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo reinforced Air leadership by means of a toolbar and made and implemented a solo trial just before the break, which gave an account of 17-5 for Air.
But the Melrose well started the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Ruaryd Knott, who had been taken out of the field on his feet, and from the Air Restaurant came forward with the attempt of Stafford McDaull, which was implemented by Clemo.
Captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colwin under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a tacdown behind Air.
Clemo attempted what he did almost every time after the restart, then Kyle Rowe received from David Armstrong a blow in the box and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by a team of masters.
Looks like the star of the All Play series is set up for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
It looks like the star of Ford Kieran's \"All Play\" series is set up for a new career in hospitality, and this is the conclusion after it's been realized that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series, the script he writes to and where he's filmed with Greg Hemfield's old comedy partner.
Dooette announced that the upcoming nine series would be the last one in the series, and it seems Kirnan was planning life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source at Scottish Sun implied that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “extensive restaurant business. ”
\"More of Ours\": Intramaterial Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol an equipped fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings hang an ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by a motto: \"More is our right.
We have to get him back.\"
In Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that Chile has gone away in the bloody 19th century conflict through natural resources, and there is a desire to re-float in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in the last decades, because Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of trial.
\"There is momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it looks forward to a positive outcome,\" commented Roberto Calsadius, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICC ruling on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will make a decision in favour of Bolivia that after decades of extensive discussions Chile will have to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his election in the following year, also holds high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, there will be little change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decisions of the ICJ, made only six months after the final arguments were made, indicate that the matter was “not complicated”, told Paz Zaraté, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia did not advance, the last four years could have contributed to the rollback.
“ The drinking of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration, ” said Zarathe.
Morales, a militant rhetoricist, blew up the remains of Chilean kindness, assuming it was.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences by gaining mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime question as a political beauty.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
This is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.\"
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make the promises made during the Singapore summit by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went into a dead end more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Cheng Inn.
Ri says that believing that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “infinite dream”.
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps out of disarmament.
That's how President Donald Trump of America wants a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country may consider the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeio plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim and Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend in massive headwear that is already heading the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, you have found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown's designers have demonstrated a number of eccentric head coverings in the spring-lito collection of 2019 on podiums of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very unpractical hats engrossed Instagram this summer, and name designers have already sent their dizzy creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagance beige hat with broad feathers of fields that covered the head of the models.
Among other overtures, accessories are decorated with precious coffee stones, a magic hat, and even an pineapple hat, but they are not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a set of original masks — very timely in front of Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had their lips sewed up and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One was like an equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and glasses, and another looked like an ice cream that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stimulants say that huge hats can reach the main streets of your city.
Onsides hats came into fashion with Lea Bombie, a straw hat with a width of six inches [six cm] that was seen at all, from Rianna to Emily Ratazkowski.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag about the size of a model in the dome that carried it.
The bag of yellowish red rafia with rafia bahram and white leather pen was the central element of La Riviera's 2019 spring-lito brandy Jacquemus on a Paris fashion week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told F.E.: \"The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the effect of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore demand for near-ahead accessories.\"
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential to citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 it was again the result of exams that are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other areas.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (S.S.R.E.), which seeks to ensure the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person who understands a language, he can take it from the mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she takes it with her heart.\"
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
In recent exams this year, we see that in independent schools, the language is lazy in the rankings of the subjects with the best grades.
Altogether, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data gathered in 74 SRNSH schools showed that 72% of students received higher A scores from Chinese and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students received A as well.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages are being produced in the same way as NTIM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) objects, through independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close down vacancies related to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential in training young people for future careers.
As more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you've chosen, if someone has learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double percent (15%).
That's why investment in language education is now important for today's children.
Learning a few languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities to find full - time employment.
In Scotland each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose a few languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that equips children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what is in their future.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see Lebron James' first launch for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-session game against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, not solved yet.
\"It's going to be more than one and less than 48,\" said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Frankers reporter Mike Trull reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers pre-session.
“At this stage, I don’t need pre-session games to prepare my career, ” he replied.
Trump et al. in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-election rallys from Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump's next week's mitings, including rallies in friendlyly set states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final ballot for the candidacy that he has proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for future mid-term elections because the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What time is it going to take today's Trump evening rally in West Virginia, and how do you watch it on the Internet?
Miting Trump, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 o'clock Eastern time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump will probably mention the intense hearings that took place this week on the occasion of a candidate for the Britta Cavanaugh Supreme Court, who is charged with sexual harassment, and the suspension of the Senate vote for the week while the FBI is under investigation.
But the main goal of this rallying series is to help Republicans get popularity before the November election.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five mittings next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
\"The control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible because of the impending season of the pre-election campaign,\" said Reuters, a representative of Trump's campaign, who did not want to call his name.
Today’s rally from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as from the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisi, whose ranking falls behind in the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his ranking in surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions of unilateral victory, the weekends of the Sabbath forts can be exactly what the Ryder Cup lacked.
A lean pulse pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept that players truly believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say the pulse works?
\"They were in front of six points, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little bit as a pulse,\" said Jordan Speth when he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, Speth says, feel a little bit of wind in their sails, and there's also a lot of them that's encouraged, not least, the form of Spit and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and each one made three points out of four.
Spying with his killer blows from the guidebook to the hail shows an example.
These larynx cries of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a crucial patch and compared the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas had been off by two points.
His sweat, which allowed them to win the 15-hole match, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem like it.
\"You really should just try very hard and worry about your own match,\" said Spy.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 Holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood in the last two days, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but fascinating couple in Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday and Friday mornings and nine last moons on Friday mornings.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flitwood or Molinari to secure a potential victory for Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Greedy on both faces at the same time.
However, talk about European triumph before it is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson set out with Sergio García, the hero of the morning forks when he was in a match with Alex Noren.
One Godge and two dabbles on the first nine moons brought the Spanishman and the Swede to the hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to see forballs and forsoms coming close through the interaction between the couple's participants, because of the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a single moment.
Europe is currently playing better as a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this fortress session has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight in which some, especially the Americans, question.
Europe leads with a count of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day, the Ryder Cup of Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturdays and forsoms, it is ahead of the United States with a 10-6 count.
The inspired duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari have won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to recover the trophy that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forks with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the force and won two games, but failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while Mollinari (with Mollywood) is only the second pair to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in forballs, they joined together to beat the mad Woods and American novice Bryson Deshambo with an even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled the two matches on Saturday, demonstrated random outbreaks of genius, but at present he lost 19 of his 29 forball and forsom games and seven sub-combat matches.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forballs, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the forks to get a defeat with a score of 2ta1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, the first and third in the world's ranking.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way in this pleasant fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three times the top winner Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a two - point standard for Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Poulter, in forballs, and later beat Poulter and Rory McLroy, with a count of 4ta3 in the forsoms, losing the first two moons.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four point deficit in singles, although Furika's team needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it were beyond their reach.
North Korea says that no one will disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday informed the UN that the continuation of the sanctions deepens mistrust in the United States, and under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea used “substantial measures of goodwill”, such as cessation of nuclear and missile testing, dismantling of nuclear testing sites, and commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"One, we don't see the appropriate response from the United States,\" he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated the familiar complaints of North Korea against Washington’s “poe-proof” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement proved important in not rejecting the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had made in the past.
Ris referred to Kim Chen Inn's joint statement and Donald Trump's first summit in history between the real U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the Korean Peninsula's “denucleorization”, while Trump promised North Korean security assurances.
North Korea is reaching out for the formal end of the Korean War of 1950 - 53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the calls for the weakening of international sanctions on North Korea.
“ The United States insists on ‘ denuclearizations at first ’ and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a violent way, and even denies the ‘ declaration of the end of war ’, ” said Re.
“The thought that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is, the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.\"
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that U.S. leader stressed at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae In in the last five months and added: \"If the side in this matter of denuclearization would be South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not go into such a dead end.\"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of the last time he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after “Mister of the Evil President” Trump called Kim a “man-rocket” who wants to commit suicide.
This year, at the U.N. Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in using disarmament measures, but said that much more would have to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he was not setting a time limit for this: \"It will take two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and steadily until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.\"
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for nuclear programs and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly fists and then said that next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeio had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea had convicted him of \"gangster demands.\"
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “equipable measures”.
He explained that Kim says that he needs “reliable measures” are security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all its students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning all night after cooking.
The teacher found that the university number one in the world was often uneducated when it came to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate the course after he gave a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on his studies.
At the end, a girl came up to him and said, \"Why do I have to say this now, in my final year?\"
“ She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me, ” explained The Telegraph instructor.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are asked how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, as well as to improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to introduce a course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive jobs.
In one chapter there are pictures of a room in a dorm where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficit on sports performances, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
In another chapter, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the online campus map encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
\"We know it won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking,\" Professor Chaisler added.
There is still a culture of pride for sleep all night, it added, and it also noted that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for a student to deal with stress, burnout, and anxiety, even with a set of overweight, since sleep deprivation moves the brain into a hunger regime, causing permanent physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard's first year.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he expects, will be a request to all graduate students to receive a similar training program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students be reminded that they should go to bed and set up a alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light ” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and that it may disrupt the circus rhythm, causing sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerard's boys
Rangers survived another invasion of oesophagus: the blow of Dolly Menga brought to the distinguished team of Stephen Gerard a defeat with a score of 1.0 from Livingstone.
The Aybrox team wanted to win their first victory in an outback match after a February triumph over St. John's with a count of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard the other as the 18-game manager. Gerard's team was left eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Harts Premier.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Ringers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could equal an account.
Now, the Rangers went down to position six, and the Livingstone rose to number three, and in a difference of balls, they're just ahead of the Hibernian.
Also, Rangers may have another problem with this because the lineman Calum Spence was forced to handle his head wound after having been thrown into the guest sector by an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that once passed the Air to the Scottish League Cup of Finals.
And Holt released the same Livi 11 warehouse that took one point in the Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his forced boys pushed out rivals in every corner.
Maybe Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingstone worked more with the ball he got.
They were to kill just two minutes later when the first Menga pass in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGrehor's gates, but the half-protector wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Kean Jacobs' deep free punch got Craig Halkett's skipper, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, hit the back of his pants.
The Rangers really got control, but on the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should have the right to the toolbar on the mark a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Lawless, but Stephen Thomson’s referee rejected the Colombians ’ appeal.
Rangers managed to do only two strikes on the front door in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former Aybrox gatekeeper hit Lassana Coolibaly's head and the calm blow of Ovie Ejariya was hardly disturbed.
Even though the previous Livingstone goal may have contradicted the course of the game for 34 minutes, no one can deny that they have earned it only through their hard work.
Rangers failed again to cope with Jacobs' rescue.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple ending.
In a break, Gérard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the henger tried out to Morelos, but the amazing Kelly pulled him off his line to block him.
However, Loveston continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they like when Litgo and Halkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team was able to improve the outcome in the last stages, but McGreghorn did a good job of resisting Jacobs before Letgo hit it from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replaced with Rangers, made another late application for a fine when confronted by Jacobs, but Thomson again dismissed the view.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Geiger, was born in Germany.
Heiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that in time evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the counted Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of popculture, such as the 1950s \"The Doors of Coronado\" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboys.
The man, \"What's all this?\"
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by radioactivity in minerals.\"
Evans: \"Well, it's really shaking!\"
Gaiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see\" and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which are part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
And then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancers, and then these cells re-inject the patient.
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has had more than 18 months of cancer.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can be seen in common for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-injecting them to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer, Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our findings show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 is stimulating the growth of several types of cancer — including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,\" he explained.
A similar approach, which involves the removal of immune cells from patients and the “learning” of them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After the SNL show in the baseball show MAGA, Canier West fainted with a strong talk in support of President Trump,
what caused the audience to react negatively?
The students at the SNL studio were released by Canier after his monstrous performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and claimed to be swamped for presidential office in 2020.
After playing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball game, \"Let's Return America Former Glory,\" he exploded a tyrad in which he criticized the Democrats, and reiterated his support for Trump.
“ During a conversation, the whites ask me, ‘ How can you please Trump? ’ he’s a racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd leave America for a long time.
The SNL show began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Cavanaugh, which he gave before the Senate Legal Committee in case of Christine Blazey Ford's sexual assault.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, the video with its tyrade was displayed on social networks by Chris Rock's comic book.
Whether Rock wanted to ridicule West for that post remains unclear.
He also complained to the audience that an unpleasant situation had happened to him because of his head covering.
According to Washington Examiner, West stated: “When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
They said to me, \"Don't go out to the audience in this baseball game.\"
They've abused me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed keep silent.
West continued: “You want to see where the oppressed are quiet?
Then try to treat each other with love.
According to Variety’s weekly newspaper, his comments at least twice triggered a negative reaction from the audience in the hall, and the actors in the SNL show looked disoriented. One audience said: “The studio was dominated by dead silence...
Last minute, they invited us to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, MacMiller's rap, died a few days before the air.
The West caused many surprises by performing song I Love it (I love it) in a bottle suit of Perrier water.
West was supported by the head of a conservative organization called TPUSA Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the boldest is, ‘ I WON’T DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO TO PREPARATE. ’
Instead, the lead talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West is what he is, and that's just great --
“I shall not reward the one (buying his music or his clothing or supporting his ‘ art ’ — who, I think, is practicing and exposing an ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us, she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapist announced on Twitter what he had changed his name: he was “the one once known as Kanye West...
West is not the first performer to change his name, and he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Poff Deaddy, Poffey, and P Diddy.
The rapist college Snoop Dogg used to be Snooped by Lyon, and as we know, the musical legend of the last decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became \"Artist, formerly known as Princes\"

Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality because of its extremely courageous characters.
He continued: “What is natural, and what is planted for us?
Why teach television and the street that young boys feel pressured to be such men?

HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% sharp increase in new cases
In China, a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has been reported.
According to health officials, there are more than 820,000 patients nationwide.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the trend.
For a long time, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood during blood transfusions.
However, as stated by health officials at the conference held in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, China’s HIV / AIDS population grew by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community is often subject to discrimination.
According to a study, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men continue to marry women because of prevailing conservative values in the country.
In most cases, the transmission of the disease is due to improper use of sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HlV drugs, seeing that as part of the solution.
Maxine Waters object to the spill of data from Republican senators into the network by her regular staff and to the strong criticism of \"dangerous lies\" and \"theories of conspiracy\" -
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, condemned the ballots that one of her full-time employees posted the personal data of three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat in Los Angeles claims that these claims are spreading “ultra” to political viewers and websites.
“ Bullshit, lies, and then even more loathsome lies ” declared Waters in Twitter.
It is reported that published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getch of Utah.
The data came on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate commission hearing on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The data leaked some time after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill magazine reported that conservative websites like Gate Pundit and RedState had information that the source IP address was linked to the Waters office and found out her full-time employee's data.
“ These baseless statements are absolute untruths, they don’t really fit in,” continued Waters.
“My office co-worker, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and lying claims, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These baseless statements are absolute untruths, they don't match reality.
Waters' claim was quickly criticized on the web, and among others, the former Spokesman of the White House, Arie Flyscher, spoke.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“It suggests that, with this nature, she cannot be a member of Congress.
When accused of something he did not do, there is no need to get angry.
The accused must not act presumptuously.
He should not ask the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmoved.
It looks like Fleischer was doing a parallel between the Waters reaction and the Democrats' criticism of the address of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican Party candidate who is running to take the place of Waters after the election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“ This is the news, if everything is true, ” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already announced “the relevant government authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false claims ”
“ We will do everything we can to make sure that the guilty will be found... “She continued, ”“ and they answered before the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees...
Film Overview - Agent Johnny Inglis: New Mission - a passing parody on spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British movie for thinking about Brexit. There are these in a new part of a series of comedian parodys on Johnny Inglish. The first film called \"Johny Inglish\" was released back in 2003, and later the series was rediscovered in 2011 by \"Johny Inglish: Restart\"
Will there be a mock-iron self-sacrifice on what we are weak, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglish, with his moving face and his dazzled eyes, was given the second chance to get messed up, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
Johnny is, of course, “a cheerfully secret agent, in whom, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit of the inspector Cluso, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a lot of things — from the guy who played a single tune from the movie, the Fire chariots, at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by the traveller and the mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten television commercial by Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Inglish, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish was getting close to the helicopter in knight armor, and the spades of the screws waited for his helmet.
Atkinson's talent to set up the buffoonade is well revealed in the film, but the humor goes through, and in some aspects it's too much, especially when compared with \"serious\" movie brands, such as 007's Agent and \"Mission's Not Possible -- one of the \"inredients\" who is also a comedian.
It seems that jokes designed more for children than adults, and I don’t feel the sense of being attacked by Johnny Inglish, do not seem as inventive and thoughtful as the Atkinson's wits in silent films about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret network of spies penetrates the hacker and exposes the names of all the field agents, which became a complete surprise to the agent in question. ( Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film.)
This proved to be the last drop for the prime minister — a proud person who has already suffered destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of his loss of popularity (Emma Thompson has tried to best convey the image that Theresa May, but the script has failed to fully reveal it).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to involve a retired one.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny Inglish, who is now a teacher at a super-modal institution and is unofficially teaching children operational undercover work (this part with a spy school year - high school in this part - time section - Iglis was a few fun jokes for teenagers).
The needle quickly delivers it to Whitehol for term briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller on another occasion.
Baf is now married to the captain of the submarine.
So when everything in the Secret Ministry of Her Majesty went to pick up, “Betman and Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, played by Olga Curilenco.
And in the meantime, the Prime Minister comes under the charm of a charismatic billionaire who earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims he can solve the problem of the British network, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Baff go on the trip and re-apply their funny frays: dressed as waitressers, they fire in a shabby French restaurant; then they sow chaos by illegally going abroad on Volta's luxury yacht; and the Inglish sets up a real mess when he tries to use the helmet of virtual reality to get to know the planning of Volta's house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but by their kindness and violence, it is like a film for children.
A passing movie.
As with watching other movies about Johnny Inglis, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labourists deny making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they're going to receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is supposed to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they're going to receive a salary in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to commit company leaders to hand over the funds saved by the artificial intelligence revolution to employees, giving them an additional output.
So the workers will have a three-day weekend and they will bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea corresponds to the party's economic agenda and directs the country's resources to support the working class.
The four-day workweek transition was approved at the British Trade Union Congress, and you'll see that this way the workers can benefit from changing the general economic situation.
The Leiberist Party source reported the publication The Sunday Times as follows: “The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-day work week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industry strategy of the party --
This was not the first idea that the Green Party promised to take a four-day work week back during the pre-election campaign of 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party currently approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party stated: “The party’s political agenda does not provide for a four-day working week, so we are not discussing this idea right now...
“Shiny — chancellor John McDonnell presented his view of the socialist revolution in economics at the pre-election convention of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was set to take back power from “the silent directors — the utilities and the searchers —
The plan for the “teen - chancellor” also means that the shareholders of water companies may not get all their share of capital if the Labour Government imposes “accounts” on the basis of perceived breaches.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in company management and to create inclusive stock funds to pass 10 percent of the regular shares of private sector firms to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk to show 60 Minutes (60 Minutes), whether the Cavanaugh case led by the FBI can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Supreme Court judge has been postponed at least a week, asking if Republican senators will continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the investigation have been published.
In Sunday show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
“ Yes, of course, ” said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and asked him, \"Did you really do it?\"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising . . .
Graham’s view seems to change nothing.
“ I think the application of Cavanaugh’s charges is provocation, ” he said.
“ Dr. Forde, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly objected, ” added Graham, turning to Christine Blazey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it by oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally striking mission of overcoming global poverty.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobged in the Great Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Méndez, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival — organizers are eager to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international community organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
In order to get a free ticket for an event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a series of tasks or “acts” to learn from a volunteer project, write an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or whatever else to help bring attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So, are there any results, since it is 12 years that the organizers of Global Citizen have been left behind?
Is it really the idea to reward the action with a free concert — a genius to persuade people to demand action, or is it just another case of so - called vocativeism — when people feel that something is actually being changed by signing an electronic petition or by making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to report planned financial assesments and programs worth more than $37 billion that will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited the results of 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that some 649 million people around the world have already had a direct impact on their lives.
One of the major financial commitments is the Power of Nutrition, which is territorially applicable to Great Britain, and as part of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to helping children grow up, and promised 35 million dollars to help Rwanda cope with the problem of malnutrition after they received more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
“ In support of the British government, the patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history ” stated the representative of The Power of Nutriation Tracy Wallman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “activities” that called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the British government announced the allocation of funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which aims to improve the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, \"Why do you think you'll be able to cope with extreme poverty\" ,
Global Citizen wrote: “This is a long and arduous journey, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the civil rights and apartheid players, we're going to succeed because together we're stronger --
Janet Jackson, the band The Weekd, Sean Méndez, Cardi B, Janell Mona are just some of the star performers this year at a festival in New York City, and they're going to hold it by Deborah-Lie Fernes and Guy Jackman.
Interior minister claimed that the US could use naval forces to block forces to prevent Russian energy exports
According to Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Home Secretary, quoted in Washington Examiner, “if necessary, Washington can seek assistance from the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it is operating on the invitation of a legitimate government, is a good reason to investigate new energy.
“ I think they are in the Middle East because they want to be a middleman in energy trade, as he said in Eastern and Southern Europe. ”
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“The U.S. Navy can ensure free passage through the sea and block it if necessary so that Russian energy does not reach the market” he said.
Zinke addressed the Western member organization Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as “every consumer’s voice ” in the United States.
He next compared his approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is, in general, that we effectively use energy and replace it with alternative energy.” He said, calling Russia “one-sidedly developed — because its economy depends on mineral energies.
While these claims were being heard, Trump’s administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, out of the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, Trump and President Donald Trump, themselves, are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “indecent” project of the pipeline project, the Northern Stream 2 - which, Trump says, will make Berlin the hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that gas “Northern Flow 2 — a cost of $11 billion and double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters — is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin convinces me that Washington is taking a hard stand against the project for just economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer must be able to select suppliers ” stated Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered Germany’s negative reaction, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German lead organization Federal Union of German Industry (BDI) called on the United States not to interfere with the energy policy of the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes with our supply of energy ” stated Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federal Union after the last meeting of the German chancellor, Angeli Merkel, with Russian president Vladimir Putin.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will think seriously about chatting for the presidency in 2020.
A senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that “he will think seriously about the balloting of the presidency after the election.
During a public meeting in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of making his candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, the publication stated: “It is time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for this to happen, there must be a woman in his head...
♪ After November 6th, I'll think seriously about putting forward my candidacy for the presidency ♪
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation for Donald Trump’s presidency, claiming that he “will lead his country in the wrong direction.
“ I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren was open - minded, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidate for the office of Judge of the Supreme Court, Bretta Cavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote: “... no doubt, before voting, the FBI has to investigate ...
However, according to a survey published on Friday, most Warren voters do not believe that they should be chatted in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Soffolk Center for Policy Research and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential Massachusetts voters opposed the senator's nomination.
Thirty - two percent supported the promotion.
The survey indicated that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, was given greater support, and that 38% against - 48% for potential presidential promotion.
During the discussions, other well-known democracies who could run in 2020 are also known as former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator, from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Baden claimed that he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Paylin mentions the PTSR Trek Paylin during a rally to support Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my son is going through right now, what he is going through after his return, can only understand the other families that are going through the effects of PTSD and the other health problems that our soldiers are returning to their home,” she said to the rally to support Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called Trek’s arrest “a problem that no one pays attention to ” and said that her son and other war veterans are “returning home not as they used to be more cruel, and want to know if what they have done here is respected by their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country...
According to police spokesman Basila, Dan Bennett, Treck was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, and prevented him from reporting the incident of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and Districts of Colombia support asylum policy appeals
Eighteen states and districts in Colombia support a new U.S. policy to deny refugee status to victims of banditry and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county sent an analytical note to the court counsel in Washington, D.C. to support a complainant who needed asylum and complained in court about the policy.
The full name of the case of Grace v. Seshnes, after the American Union for Civil Rights, which is challenged by federal politics and filed in August, does not reveal itself.
The lender claimed that her partner and his brutal son-in-law had beaten her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
It was held illegally in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace’s lawsuits stated that the people of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (the refugees from whom asylum is often sought in the United States) are often faced with such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reverses the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that immigrants without documents leaked from domestic violence could ask for asylum.
General Carl Reisin, Attorney General of Columbia, stated during his Friday speech that the new policy - ignores decades of state, federal and international laws -
“Federal law requires that decisions regarding applications for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and a ban violates that principle.” “is included in the analytical note by the counsel of the court.
Then, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the United States are detrimental to the economy because they are potentially able to become entrepreneurs and to “fill the necessary labour resources” .
The Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order in June for immigration judges stating that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The asylum shall be given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views” stated Seshnes during the presentation of politics on June 11.
The provision of shelter never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.

For those who are left alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
\"The situation is very tense\" says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
“ Every minute the ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is not enough
Some people return to their homes that have been destroyed, and they take to their watery homes trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 - point earthquake on the Richter scale were full.
Some of the wounded, including Two Heris with back and shoulder fractures, rest at the army hospital building of Palo, where patients are provided with open - air help because of repeated repeated back - ups.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered how a strong navel shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to escape.
I think I got stuck in the wreckage of the wall... . . . . told Gerice to an Associated Press reporter, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife beg for help, and then she was calm.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe...
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “exploring psychological pressure” by means of “recalls that contain propaganda”.
A week after the public Chinese newspaper placed an advertising material on the four pages of the American daily edition on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday went to the pay allowance for China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after China's indictment of trying to influence elections to Congress on November 6, China rejects these charges.
According to the Reuters Agency, Trump’s claims in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to interfere with American elections mean a new phase of escalation by Washington, D.C., whose goal is to pressure China.
Although foreign governments can place advertisements for promoting trade, there is a time-consuming escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, where they have already increased customs for imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive customs in China was about to strike exporters from states like Iowa, who were supporting the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, a U.S. ambassador to China, and former governor of Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China, said China was hurting American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Branstead wrote in Sunday’s Des Moines Register column, “enhances the pressure by publishing propaganda advertisements in our independent press ”
“ To spread propaganda, China’s government uses the way for the American people to practice freedom of speech and press independence by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register.” Branstead wrote.
“In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you will only find individual voices of incoherent people. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which raises concerns that the media of China are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He also added that “one of the important Chinese publications offered to publish — its article, but not what it was.
Analytics warn that the failure of the Cavanaugh Republicans is to set up women voters against themselves before the intermediate elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the office of Judge Brett Kavano Supreme Court after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may result in an unwanted reaction on the eve of future intermediate elections, especially for women.
There are passions surrounding this situation, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to move on to voting.
You can't just play it back, then. . . . . in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, at which Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) began to insist at the last minute, would be enough to reassure angry voters.
As reported in the edition “Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, ” Catherine Jean-Pierre stated on Friday,“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow or November ”
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang \"Listopade Approach\" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to the confirmation of the Kavano candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
In an interview with St. Rothenberg, an out-of-party political observer, he stated: “People will be extremely interested and motivated...
“ They say that it is now, and it is true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women voters from 18 to 29 years of dormancy, who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Before Ford testified in connection with the allegations of a Supreme Court candidate for sexual assault, analysts predicted negative reactions by voters if the Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, stated: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As noted in a news channel interview by the director of the State of State USA (U.S. Presidents) (groups assisting in the pre-election campaign of Democrats), Guy Cecil, “it is not the matter of voting to the committee, finally voting, or of being caught up in the trial by Cavanaugh, but of how they reacted to the situation and how they acted in the next place ”
However, the American opinion on who to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, is divided, and Ford is a little more supportive.
According to a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony believes or more readily believes 35% of those surveyed.
In addition, 38% of those polled said that they thought Cavanaugh had given or were more likely to give false testimony, while Ford had said the same thing to 30% of those surveyed.
As reported in The Guardian, after Flake’s insistence, the FBI tests charges against Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford gave a witness under oath to the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavano attacked her while she was 17 years old intoxicated.
Ramírez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court justice had shown her his genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to create competition for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition for Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is working on an open source Solid platform called Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and whom to access information.
In an exclusive interview by Fast Company Berners-Lee, he said that the purpose of Inrupt is \"world domination\"
“ We have to do it now, ” he said about the startup.
It's a historical moment...
The application uses Solid technology, which will enable users to create a -- personal online data repository -- or POD.
Contact lists, current case lists, calendar, audio recording library, and other tools may be stored.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online repository is that it is fully consistent with the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it \"the expansion of personal capabilities with data \" .
According to Inrupt Director - General John Bruce, the company aims to engage resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has, a few full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer software community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own offline applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models were undergoing major changes within a short period of time.
“ We don’t ask their permission...
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee, he wrote that the mission of Inrupt - to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
♪ I look very optimistic about the next era of networking ♪ added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrations of the Order of Order - Cross of Victoria in World War I
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Victoria Cross, who participated in the fighting during World War I, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded an attack at Belglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military prize.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it “extremely symbolic, ” that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through St. Katen's canal through a very thick fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he hurried to the firehouse and, with “excessive courage, led a stride forward, before which one burst into a gun and destroyed three of the enemy’s unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot down a German sniper on October 4, 1918 -- a little over a month before the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he could never have repeated and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a crown after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “it feels very proud of being involved in this parade ” and added that“ the courage of the true hero demonstrates the respect that so many people express toward him...
Fans MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator's 206 tournament, but instead they were shown \"Peppu Pig\"
Imagine that you're awake all night just to watch the Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to watch the main event.
There were 13 fighting in San José tournament offices, including six main programs broadcast live in the United Kingdom at night on 5 canals.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were ready to go to a match, television viewers in Britain died of surprise when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some spectators were not thrilled with this, since they did not sleep until the morning waiting for a fight.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him to be “some kind of a bad joke ”
“ According to the government’s decree, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to make a child transmission, ” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations Bellator when asked about television broadcasts, “
\"Peppo Pork,\" yes --
Bellator President Scott Coker has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“ I think if we talk about the repeat of the broadcast, we can do it, ” said Coach.
“But now it's Sunday, 6th morning, and we won't be able to do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcasts were off, we had a lot of messages that we were responding to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical problem, and we were trying to solve it.
However, it proved to be a lack of conformity with government regulations.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five battles instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to send a signal to the fans, but we've put those attempts down so far.
A Really Delicate Situation — How?
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that \"not everyone looked like him\" until he went to high school.
As he took part in the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs broadcast on Radio 4 by Laurent Lavern, he pointed out that he was open about gay rights in order to give “hope ” to others.
He also claimed that his father’s concern for winning the Olympic Games was less.
A longtime hostess, Kirsti Young, went to a hospital for several months.
Upon arriving as a couple for Lavern’s first program, Daley claimed to have felt “sicker than others in childhood, because“ society did not perceive when boys and girls liked ”
He said: “By this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the motivation and strength to succeed. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that something “watchable ” was not to disappoint all who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympics present as a famous fighter for LBGT community rights and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was honest about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give it to others.
The world three - time champion admitted that the feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Daley married Oscar's laureate, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
“When you walk through so much at such a young age — (at the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer), it is difficult to find someone of his age who would also have experienced similar overflights and falls.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to Daley, his \"worldview\" has changed.
“ If you had asked me last year, I would have thought only that I had to get the gold, ” he said.
“ You know there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie--
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the thought of the end and asked just before he died if they had purchased tickets to London Olympic 2012 because they wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him, ‘ You won’t be in the front row because you won’t be there anymore, ’ ” said Daley.
“ I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“ I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to dive before my countrymen at the Olympics, and no better feeling than that, ” said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to select his first song, Proud (Hordy), in the performance of Heather Small, which was resonating with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still provokes anthills.
The Dessert Island Discs program goes to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m.
On Saturday from the Ryder Cup, Miquelson was taken out, which was not in shape.
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tournament game for \"Ryder's Cup\" but he will have to restore the form so that it will not become unhappy.
Michelson, who participates in the 12th record tournament every two years, led Captain Jim Furik out of the game during the forballs and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of the events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner would encourage the team all day and train his side, hoping to control his emotions.
Since Miquelson wasn't well-known for being at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman wasn't exactly good for a complex field of Le Golf National golf, where the raf usually punishes wandering blows.
And if it's not that hard on the field, in the ninth match on Miquelson Sunday, you'll have to meet the Open Champion and the exact strike master Francesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a pair with Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans, who fall behind three points after 12 single games, start well, Miquelson’s match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add.
“ He fully understood his role today, shook my back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow he would be ready... ” said Furik.
“ He has no doubt about his power.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame that has done so much for teams this past and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I predicted more matches, but that's how it turned out, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anybody else.
If Miquelson goes to the field on Saturday, he'll hit Nick Fallo's record, who played the largest number of games in the Rider's Cup--
He may have completed his career in the Rider's Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
In Miquelson's account, 18 wins, 20 failures, and 7 outcomes, but Furik said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s tiring, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny with others.
“ I think the younger players had a great deal of fun coming at him and also this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big breakup doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the sensed break before the solitary match on the last day of the Rider's Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 in a match at the Walderram Club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros outpaced the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight break with a result of 141 - 2:131 - 2.
“ You remind us that we had a big break in the match in the Valderrami field; a big break in the Brookline where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we were forced to win... said Bjorn after watching the winning games Class 2018 with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing is left out.
Tomorrow we should play with the greatest return.
Go out to the field and do what you need.
The game will only end after the result has appeared on the tab.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who is against us -- the world's best players --
Satisfied with the performance of his players in the difficult field, Bjorn added: “I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can be different.
Tomorrow we're expected to have individual matches, and that's something else.
It's great to play the field with your partner when everything's going well, but it's when you stand there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set up players tomorrow: at the opportunity limits.
You leave your partner out of support, and now he also has to show what he can do.
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furik expects his partners to play better at the individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spight and Justin Thomas, who score three points out of four.
To Furika's very last day, fate came from different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a European team created the \"Chuda in Medina\"
“ I remember every bloody word ♪ ♪ he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain of 1999 was organizing players before the last day of the competition.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to make a successful start, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative turns to someone else’s side, the players in the middle of the distance face special pressure.
We put the players in the team accordingly, as if we were going to do something incredible tomorrow.
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the counterattack in the top mother against Rory Macilroy, and then on the first half of the list, the European teams came from Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Ian Poulter.
“These partners themselves, and in this way, I chose because I wanted to distribute my efforts evenly throughout the entire game — so Bjorn commented on his choice of players at the individual games.
The introduction of a new German battleship was postponed
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was to be put in place in 2014, instead of the old Cold War battleships, but in local media, it's not going to happen until at least the next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the rapid increase in spending.
According to Die Zeit, a report from a military official, the launch of a ship called the Rhineland-Platz, the main vessel of a series of the most modern class frigates, Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were detrimental to the implementation of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, would replace the obsolete class frigates- Bremen-
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some technologies to reduce visibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of maintenance. It is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that because of constant delays over-modern warships that would boost Germany's military capacity at sea, it will also become obsolete at the time of its introduction.
The long-lasting F125 frigate came under the headlines of the newspapers last year, when German naval forces officially refused to take action and returned it to the Bluhm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a warship was returned after delivery by a shipbuilding company.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned significant “defactions of software and equipment” that made a battleship unfit for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are particularly significant, since the crew of a class ship called Baden-Württemberg consists of about 120 sailors, only half the number of military personnel serving on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant surplus of weight, which makes it more difficult to operate and limits the possibility of further modernization.
Fregate-Reinland-Platz is said to be twice as heavy as (7,000 tons) as the same class' ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides the malfunctioning equipment, another problem is the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have become an enormous 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have taken on special importance in the light of recent warnings about the decline of the German Navy.
Early in the year, the authorized Bundestag on armed forces, Hans-Peter Barrtels, reported that the country's Navy had “a limited number of ships capable of carrying out military tasks” —
The officer stated that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for some time, since the old ships had been out of operation and the new ships had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret over the fact that none of the class frigates, Baden-Württemberg, had been able to complete the navy.
The National Trust will watch bats live in secret.
A new study, conducted on the land area in the Highlands of Scotland, aims to establish how bats use the landscape to find food.
Researchers hope that this information will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals so that they can be preserved in the future.
In In the Inverya Gardens in Wester Ross, the National Trast of Scotland will observe species such as the netopire dwarf and the netopir of the Pygmies, as well as the ear of a common and watery night.
Special registrants will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to monitor bat behavior during the season.
The Scottish National Trust will also carry out mobile testing using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds can help to establish the frequency and belonging of bat screams.
Then we're going to develop a detailed map of how animals live and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser in the National Trust in Scotland, hopes that research will help determine which areas of residence are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help you to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (e.g., meadow formation) and determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations declined significantly in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened with extensive construction and exploitation of areas that deprive them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, sticky paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, hunting during the night helps their ears to catch prey more effectively than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and interfere with flight trajectories.
In the National Trust of Scotland, which covers over 270 historical buildings, 38 special gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] throughout the country, bat problems are very serious.
Ten trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization's efforts are even made by the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, which is located in the Trives area of the Damfries-and-Gallaway region, where eight of the 10 species of bats living in Scotland are found safe.
David Thompson, the manager of the site, says that this is the perfect place for them.
“ In the area of the site, there are three wonderful conditions for bats ♪ ♪ I assure him.
“ There are old buildings, many huge trees, and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and because of the research that we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to thrive on --
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before doing any kind of technical work, because unintentionally destroying one nesting site to take out the young can cause as many as 400 female babies to die, which is likely to cause the entire local population to be destroyed.
Bats and their nests are protected by law, and animals are prohibited from killing, tormenting, or disturbing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish bat conservation center, urged the public to join the organization.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we have not yet uncovered the characteristics of the populations of many species. ”
Ronaldou rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Kristian Ronald called the rape charges “naclop” and stated that people are “trying to draw attention to themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspicious information.
American Kathryn Majorga accused the Forwards of the Portugal Congregation and the Juventus Football Club of the rape that occurred in the 2009 Inn room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were brought, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned 142 million of his fans to Instagram videocasts, calling the corresponding messages “accurse —
“ No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are slander, a statement made on camera by the five-time-old ball owner.
“They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to come to me, but these situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good at it, - added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing lawsuits against Der Spiegel for the published charges they have referred to as “an impermissible report of privacy suspicion ”
Christian Schertz’s lawyer claimed that a football player would seek compensation for “moral harm in the amount that is consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the greatest cases of personal rights violations in recent years ”
The reported incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Ronald and Majord nightclub, they returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her, a witness handed over to the District Court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell to her knee and said that he was “99 percent good guy” who had been raised“ one percent -
As noted in the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where the injuries she sustained were photographed, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because “he was afraid of revenge” and was wary of “public humiliation”.
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal because she's still suffering from an incident that she says had a place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to go to FK - Real Madrid - from FK - Manchester United - This summer he became a player in an Italian football grant, the Juventus team in 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will regret once a year the loss of automakers
Great Britain will regret a long time -- if the world leader loses his status as automan after Brexit. This is warned by the economic minister Greg Clarke.
He added that he was excited about the statement by the UK Toyota officials who told BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would have to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston near Derby.
♪ We need an agreement ♪ ♪ The Secretary of Clarke assures us ♪
The Japanese automaker claimed that the effects of border delays in case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
By last year, about 150,000 cars had been exported to the rest of the European Union, with 90% of them being exported to the rest of the European Union.
“ In my opinion, if Britain moved out of the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory would be stopped.” said Marvin Cook, Director General of Toyota, Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain will get out of the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that a Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that Brexit without a deal can pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota's manufacturing line is operating in a rapid supply of details and materials according to needs - details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles produced on demand.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, then there may be a delay and a shortage of materials at the border.
As the company notes, Toyota has no more detail than one day to place on it, so it's going to have to stop manufacturing.
Greg Clark pointed out that in terms of organizing a relationship with the EU prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), “specifically, schemes are being established to avoid problems at the border.”
\"We need an agreement, and we need to make a perfect deal, which I think will not only succeed at the present moment, but also take advantage of the prospects that have arisen\" he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
“In view of the testimony of Toyota and other automakers, we need to keep the high-efficiency supply chains in place.”
Toyota has been unable to tell how long it will stop manufacturing, but in the long run, it is expected that increased spending will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Czavalaris, head of the Unite professional association office at the Bernaston factory that has worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants are extremely concerned: “For experience, I can say that short-run jobs are not being restored ”
A representative of the government stated: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein meetings may be postponed again, noted in the White House
As reported by White House officials on Sunday, Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with the deputy attorney - general Rod Rosenstein may be “to postpone for another week” as long as the discussions on the nomination of Bretta Cavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge continue.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in elections, the connections between Trump's and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
For several months in Washington, D.C., we have discussed the possibility of releasing Müller's independence as a substitute attorney.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of early termination of President's 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amidst reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump stated that “you wouldn’t want to free Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a time match with a session of the Senate Legal Committee, where you were to testify to Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Trump's Spokesman, Sarah Sanders, gave a television show on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date of the meeting is not scheduled; it may take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see: I keep watching for the latest information in the press...
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not carry out a briefing for media in the White House from September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that a lack of briefing was not linked to a “play-of-the-public ” problem on the part of television reporters, although he added: “I won’t deny that they are playing in public —
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
“ The President answers questions more often than any other president did to him ” she said and added, not referring to the source: “Statistics speaks for itself.
Sanders pointed out that the briefing would be done anyway, but - if the press could ask the U.S. president a question, it's better than talking to me -
We're trying to communicate with the press a lot, and it should have been particularly visible in the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the President of the United States is just as good as the press conference --
Trump regularly answers questions from outside the White House, from open meetings, or from high-level meetings.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is the case, when it comes to journalists being looted and sometimes startled.
The Scottish Secretary of State for Health addressed EU employees due to Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health, in a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work for the National Health Service in Scotland, expressed appreciation for their work and asked to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before he left the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a liability to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman stated: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on the issue of exit. You should be looking forward to a solution.
But the British government is intensifying its preparations for a possible way out.
I know that this period can be very disturbing to you.
That's why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home.
Christiane Abercrombie underwent surgery after head injury
Half-protector of Tennessee State Tigers - Christian Ebercrombi underwent an emergency operation following a head injury in a Sunday match against-Wanderbilt Comodores - which his team lost with a 31:27 score. A Tennessee report report reporter reported.
The team chief coach, Tennessee State Tigers, told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
“ He went up to the sideline where he was going bad, ” said Reed.
On the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombi oxygen before carrying it off to carry out further testing.
The team official, Tennessee State Tigers, informed Chris Harris from WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombi had operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “as long as there is no evidence of the type or severity of the injury,” in the Tennessee State Tigers team, they try to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombi, a secondary student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after the transition from the Illinois team.
He did five ball captures on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he had 18 intercepts per season.
Foreign buyers will pay more government tribute if they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more tribute if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom. Additional funds will be spent to help the homeless in line with the Tori plan.
This west neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
Above the government's tax line is going to be drawn from those who don't pay taxes in Britain.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to attract an additional Pound120 million a year to help the homeless
As Teresa May has announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more tribute, and additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The increase in customs will include individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in Britain, and additional funds will be used by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open heavens.
An additional customs office, which is accompanied by a two - year - old increase in second - house and rental estate, can be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to attract an additional Pound120 million a year.
Experts estimate that 13 percent of the new real estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, resulting in higher prices and complicated tasks for those who only dream of own housing.
Many rich parts of the country, including those in the capital city, are deserting because the vast numbers of foreign buyers live outside the country.
The new plan of action came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government customs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high real estate prices by purchasing land without any further use. He urged Theresa May to give up the quotas for affordable real estate in order to correct the “dignity in the housing market” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important reforms in the field of real estate, including rent controls and the denial of evictions without good reason.
He also suggests extending the authority of the local council in the area of construction of a new dwelling.
Theresa May stated: “I promised last year that I would give my premiery the restoration of British dreams -- for each new generation life must be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build a future here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own homes has become unattainable; the problem of living in the open heavens is still very painful.
Jack Ross: “I want more than anything to be the chief trainer of congregational Scotland ”
Chief Coach FK - Sanderland - Jack Ross states that “more than anything, it is desirable to take the lead in Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scottish has re-established a club from the northeast of the country that is now in third place in the First Football League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to Stédium of Light this summer, returning last season to Prime League of Scotland.
- I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I ended up in second collection Scotland, but it ended up on that,' said Ross during the Sportsound program on the BBC Scottland Radio Station.
“When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of Congregation Scotland at the Hampshire Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as a major club coach.
Ross's predecessors at FK-Sanderland were Dick Lawyer, David Mys, Sam Ellaradeis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach FK “Alloa Atletik ” states that he did not feel nervous about going to a large club following such authoritative names, prior to rejecting the proposals from FK “Barnsly ” and “Ipswich Town —
“In the current stage, I think I'm successful if the club goes back to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and its material and technological support, this club no doubt corresponds to the level of the Premier League, and he noted.
“ This is going to be a difficult task, but I don’t think it would be a success.
Ross has only been building a training career for three years, and he's been working as a second coach at FK-Dumbarton for 15 months, and he's been at the FK-Harts headquarters for 15 months.
Then he helped “Alloa” to recoup after the FCC got to the third division, and in the next season, the St. Mirren made its way from the flight stage to gaining the title of winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at FK-Clade- -Hartlepool- -Folkerk- - St. Mirren- - and- Hamilton Academical-
“ I found myself on the crossroads, ” he recalls, talking about going to the FK-Alloa.
“ I sincerely believed that training was more appropriate for me than playing.
That sounds strange, because I've been successful, and I've made good at it, and I've reached some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that we face each week.
I still face them in the face of stress and stress, but as a principal trainer, I feel that I am in my place.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable in my adult life since I chose this profession.

Study: 7:30 Sunday is the perfect time for a cup of beer
The summer heat helped to increase the income of British pubs, which were not the best of times, but increased pressure on the network of restaurants.
The sales at pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations by Peter Martin of CGA’s business development consulting organization noted: “The solar weather, which is longer than expected, led to England’s participation in the World Cup, led to July following the same pattern as the previous month, when the production of pubs grew by 2.8%, and then things got worse in restaurants.
The red fall of 1.8% in July increased.
The pubs and bars that are based on the supply of drinks, so far they have the best performance -- the increase in their profits is equal to the loss of restaurants.
Food - serving pubs also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people are interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% a month, while food sales decreased by 3% -
Paul Newman, an analyst at the free and hospitality business department at RSM, observed: “Complete trends have been observed since late April.
Weather and widespread social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It's no wonder that groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits, and the annual decline of sales by 4.8% is a cause for special concern in the background of the need to cut costs.
The long, hot summer is not the best time for food-giving institutions. See if the more moderate temperature we observed in August can give them such a necessary break.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
The halluced sales indicator of the Coffer Peach Tracker in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed productivity indicators of the 47 labor groups, whose aggregate trade exceeds Pound9 billion. This is a generally accepted hallmark standard.
Every fifth child has a social networking account hidden from his parents.
As the study showed, 1 in 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have a social networking account hidden from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This news increased concern about possible sexual placement
20% of students reported having a - basic account - which shows parents
Every fifth child, sometimes not older than 11 years of age, creates a social networking account that is hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram, a social network for photo sharing.
This news increased concern about the possible sexual placement of content.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a clean - basic account that shows parents and one or more private ones.
The mother, who happened to come across the cover page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call there to rape me.
A study by the UK Digital Security and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) organizations in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social networking profiles. Half of these children admitted that the extra account was secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, noted: “We are very concerned that many teenagers feel a desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elyde Doyle will be a \"representative of athletes' interests\" at Scottish Athletics Council
Elyde Doyle is elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual General Council.
Doyle, Scotland's best-founded pilot. Council Chairman Jen Beatty described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport movement to benefit from its wide experience gained internationally during the past decade.
“Eiled enjoys great respect among athletes in Scotland, Britain, and the world, and we are convinced that engaging in athletic sports in Scotland will bring great benefits,” Beatty assured.
Doyle observed: “With inspiration, an athlete’s interest speaker: I hope I can really benefit from and promote sports development in Scotland.

He wrote in Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much more time would be needed.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely, and I learned to walk again and to perform dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your support.
In the ad, women's milk sucker was compared to cows -- the thoughts of Internet users divided.
The milk sucker has come across a mixed response from Internet users to advertising in which young mothers compare with effective cows.
To mark the release of a product called the world's first quiet, low-cost milk sucker, Elvie's consumer product technology company released ads in the style of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that mothers enjoy a new sucker.
Four real mothers dance in a son-filled cow under a song containing the following words: “Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail; and, as you can see, it is not a wash, but my breasts.
Next, the choir sings: “Suck, suck, feed children, suck, suck, so that the milk does not waste ”
However, an advertising video published on the Facebook page caused a violent discussion online.
The video got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet user response was mixed, and many people pointed out that advertising undervalued -- a terrible organization -- the production of milk in industry.
“ It is not a very wise decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their children are taken to it in a few days after birth - a user wrote.
Elvie milk sucker can easily be hidden in a feeding booklet (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: “I realized it was traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not get them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies -
Another added: “This advertisement is very far from being a reality —
Other users defended the commercial. One of the women in the video seemed “very cheerful ”
- I think that's a brilliant idea.
You would surely have acquired such a thing if you were still breast - fed.
I felt like a cow as I sucked the milk.
Advertisements are kind of crazy, but I didn't look for a secret meaning in it.
A wonderful product - someone wrote.
Here is another comment: “A funny ad, aimed at moms sucking milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet), and they feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry --
At the end of the video, women display milk suckers hidden in their brages.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie sucker works perfectly quietly, without wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in the feed market, enabling women to move, hold their children, and even walk outside.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s advertising agency, commented on this situation: “Elvie’s sucker is so revolutionary that it requires vivid and provocative representation.
By making a parallel between women who are squirting milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way of showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker will bring.
Elvie sucker doesn't get into news headlines for the first time.
As part of the London Week Fashion, the mother of two children appeared on a podium with this product while she showed her dress from the modeler Marta Jakubowska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, in part because strict rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration have complicated the placement of children in caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were undocumented immigrants themselves; now they are afraid of putting in danger their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June, when federal agencies announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to fingerprint and that these data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking Bureau of Immigration and Customs Control, testified to the Congress that the officers of the Bureau had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for minors without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal past.
“ About 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, and many of them are foreigners who have committed an offence.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these persons,” noted Mr. Albens.
According to asylum officials, in order to deal with children in a quicker manner, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, not 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use video conferences rather than come to court in person to prove their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who are not eligible for asylum will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official figures from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of them experiencing anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Law - enforcement authorities claim that these problems are increasing in institutions of greater size, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to the tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends, we risk intensifying the trauma that many have suffered.
Syria ordered the “occupancy forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Furthermore, in his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualm urged Syrian refugees to return home, although war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as a deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegal in the Syrian land because of the fight against terrorism, so “the treatment of them would be appropriate ”
“ They must go immediately and not make a condition, ” he declared at the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He declared that Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territory — from terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreign presence —
They mostly teach and consult Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - devastated country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
In the case of refugees, Mualem guaranteed that the country had the right conditions to return them, and he charged “some Western countries” with “promoting unreasonable fears ” that prevented refugees from returning.
“ We have called upon the international community and the humanitarian community to make sure that the people come back, ” he said.
“We observe an effort to politicize the humanitarian problem...
The U.S. and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until a political agreement between Asad and an opposition to the cessation of war has been made.
The United Nations diplomats report that the recent Russian - Turkish agreement to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great stronghold of the rebels, made it possible to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Treaty has prevented the large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, to a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem emphasized that the treaty had “clear terms” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the Al-Qaida-related Front of Al-Nusr, who would be “brought to be destroyed”
UN Commissioner Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will be composed of government representatives and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem set out conditions for the Syrian government’s participation on the committee, stating that its work should be limited to “the review of the articles of a valid constitution ” and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as likely to be expected by many liberals, he would not be authorized early after the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt this would be the “dramatic end of the presidency all the time ”!
Currently, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime time viewers has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel ended up at the top of a 3.5 million night audience rating when major news is discussed.
“ This is the fire that attracts people, because it is beyond our understanding, ” said Neil Burr, executive producer of the drama, “the final candidate on ABC's canal of the Secretary of State, who becomes president after the destructive attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book, \"Best funny moments: as well as some harsh truths about getting into the Hollywood male club,\" suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to the Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
“ Why, ” she asked.
“ Because he makes me laugh, ” he said, “that’s a story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos entertains.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Rowe v. Wade, the possibility of reunifying immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Opposing is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged spectators.
Still, you cannot say that you are just trying to remain informed by citizens when you watch for six hours when a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s “well - informed ” sources for his book Fear — Paul’s jacket of the ostrich’s skin for $15,000 — clothes for the arrogant — written in The Washington Post — and the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump’s anatomy published by Stormie Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same.

Externalizations of Funds into the Hardest Crossing Choices in Congress
It's no wonder that in the 17th county of Pennsylvania, there's extra cash flows, because through a survey of the electoral boundaries, two active congressionals are calling for one chair.
In the fight for this ancient district of Pittsburgh, the border of which has recently been changed, is a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won another district in an additional election last spring.
The lamb resists another valid congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely in line with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in January, ruled that the old boundaries of the districts were set out in favor of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district caused severe opposition between the financial divisions of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning a minimum advantage in 18th district during the additional elections in the Congress in March, which enjoyed widespread public attention.
President Donald Trump won this district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats little advantage.
In the United States, we considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but we changed our mind.
The diplomats reminded of Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and Trump also had a hotel in Panama before the partners expelled the staff hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to call back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “the recent decisions on Taiwan’s lack of knowledge” announced to the Department’s Spokesman, Gezer Neuert, earlier this month.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received some $140 million in assistance in 2017, including drug control, as well as social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which would reduce financial aid and target restrictions on visas, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Internally, officials from the North American and Central American states have postponed the conference to a high level on security and economic prosperity, and a similar event has taken place last year, and it has been seen as a step forward in efforts to curb the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a conference held in mid-October as a sign that the administration considers this event to be very important.
At this time, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new harsh messages or punishments on the part of Washington.
Mr. Bolton in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, were informed on an anonymous basis.
The information provided was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The following trouble may be reported by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, and the reasons for the public information now available can be found.
It is reported that as part of his investigation, Muller is checking the possible link between Trump's campaign and our attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in the Congress moves into the other hands, Trump will have to report to the congressors, as will the voters and eventually the same party.
There's a lot in this case, if anything, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the chance to escape the slaughter.
The course of history is defined by these turning points, and the unruly movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now waiting for a few of these turning moments.
What are we going to do if Trump frees Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble even while this paper had information that last year he was proposing to secretly record a conversation with the President and share his thoughts on Trump's irrelevance of office.
Rosenstein called the report in The Times inaccurate.
How do we react if the investigations against Brett Cavanaugh, which recently started by the FBI, are not sufficiently thorough or honest, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle-term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future --

Graham Dorrans with - Rangers - with optimism waiting to meet Vienna - Rapid
FK Rangers takes \"Rapido\" (Widden) on Thursday, and after the amazing nothing in Spain in the game of \"William\" early this month, winning over the Austrians will provide Scottish club with a good chance of getting out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the injury, Graham Dorrans' knee champion was only able to play for his team for the first time in the season in a match with \"Villerreal\" that ended with a score of 2:2. But he believes that FK Rangers can use this as a trump to achieve more.
- That was a good result for us, because Villarreal, a strong team, noted a 31-year-old player.
“We went out to play with hope of getting something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could go forward, but the totality of the nothing can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we adjusted the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another major confrontation in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, and our future opponents have shown a good score in their last game, but we can count on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we'll be able to fight and achieve a positive outcome.
The past year has certainly been a difficult one, starting from my injuries and ending up with changes in the club itself, but the situation has been normalizing now.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy, training goes well.
I hope we can move on, leave the past season and succeed
Women lose their sleep because of the fear of retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few people talked about it with their family members.
Some half of the people who participated in the nationguide study said they were talking to their husband or their wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of those polled talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by a member of the family, but they don’t rush to start talking about the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the company Nationguide life insurance unit.
That's where we start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need unless you communicate your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult your counselor and family to figure out where and how to get care, since this choice can become a major factor in determining cost.
Include a financial consultant: He can advise on how to cover expenses.
Long-term care funding sources include traditional insurance policies, hybrid life insurance policies, or self - insurance at your own expense (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: This will help you to avoid a legal burden ahead of time.
Prepare your trust for a representative who will control your medical care and ensure that experts do your best if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, it is recommended that we place our trust in money management.
Select a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay your bills in case of incapacity.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of casualties can increase.
Because of the breakout of the communications system, humanitarian aid officials can't get any information from the Dongal Regent, a region north of Palo, which is close to the magnitude of a 7.5-point magnitude earthquake.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us take a look at a few basic facts about the island of Sulawesi, the city of Pala and the residence of Dongala.
The Palu capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to 2017 figures.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th year.
Dongala is a regency extending more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to a 2017 report, some 299,200 people live in the administrative region at the bottom of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are major industries in the province of central Sulawesi, especially the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palo and Donggal have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis.
In 1938, the Dongala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is situated in the seismically active Pacific Fire Ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom — in the province of Aceg.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit south Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra, a 7.6 - magnitude magnitude magnitude earthquake was recorded.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentava Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] in height, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the province of Aceg, causing the destruction and panic of the fact that people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed under the wreckage of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Paylin’s eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Pailin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Paylin, were arrested for being charged with assault.
According to a Saturday report by Alaskan police from 29-year-old Pailin, from Vassilli, Alaska, they were arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing his reporting of violence and resistance during arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took the phone away from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is under guard at Matanusca-Sustin's tracking insulator with 500 dollars' mortgage.
He was tried on a Saturday, where he declared himself “innocuous ” when he was asked if he would confess his guilt and report it online.
Paileen is charged with three Class A misconducts, which involve up to one year’s imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with grade B misconduct, which is punished with a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
For the first time against Pailin, criminal charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and was prevented from reporting domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of drunkenness when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, a tsunami caused hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The network and the power supply are out of order, and the number of casualties can increase in the near days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Jakarta’s capital.
The videos on social networks show the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu, when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a suspected New York terrorist.
In New York City, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Sifulo Sayipov, a suspected New York attack that killed eight people -- rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, a 30-year-old Soip was said to be driving a domestic Depot pickup to a bicycle track along the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat up cyclists and pedestrians that were on his way.
According to the report of the intent to achieve the execution in South New York City to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Sayipov “intentionally ” killed eight persons and, “intentionally, caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court records, each of these counts provides for the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice brought charges against Saipov on 22 counts, including eight charges of murder, which are usually brought by federal prosecutors in cases involving organized crime, as well as accusations of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers, who described the Saipov crime as being “horrible, cruel, and pernicious - this attack is the result of “real planning and a prethought of reason ”
The victims who were injured or killed were Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Ernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the intention.
The five dead were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last time in South New York County, there's been a crime of capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalida Barnes, was convicted of murder by two drug providers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the federal death penalty was executed in New York City in 1953, and the couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov’s court records, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show qualms of conscience the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that he had been inspired by the IDI video attacks he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked for an IDI flag in his hospital room.
He did not claim to be guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders represented by Sayipov, said that they were “very disappointed ” by such a decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and convicting a life sentence without the possibility of release will only intensify the psychological trauma caused by those events ” said Patton.
Saipov's defense earlier also asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Parliamentary MP from the Conservative Party believes that the FARJA's OFF needs to be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit.
Today, while protesting at the conservation party convention, Nigel Faraj promised to mobilise the people's army
A former leader of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom stated that politicians should be pressured to be Europeans, since a member of Parliament, Theresa May, offered his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A representative from the Conservative Party, Peter Boun, said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would have done if Mr. Faraj had been the Brexit secretary.
The attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile his deep-seated ranks further attracted the fact that the members of the Conservative Party who opposed the withdrawal joined in a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to put into effect the compromise plan of the Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not give up trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite its negative reaction, and will force Europeans and Labourists to choose between what it offers and “Hoos ” .
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal, Mr. Boun said he wanted to \"disown from Chequers\"
He invited Mr. Faraj to leave the shadows and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
“ If he was responsible, we would have gone out. ”
Wellingborough Member of Parliament added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he stated: “We fought in the world wars not to get under control.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and are reluctant to go out is completely untrue. ”
A member of the Conservative Party and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters: “I just say, ‘ Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition isn't going to vote for it, it's not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking around the streets fighting for voters.
Please let go of the Chequers and start listening.\"
In her address to Theresa May she added: “The prime ministers retain their office when they fulfill their promises . . .
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should be pressured to abandon the 2016 referendum decision.
“ This is the question of trust between us, people and our political elites, ” he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they won't get away with it\"
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressured.
We mobilize the national army of this country that leads us to win Brexit and will never calm down until we become independent, self-inflicted, proud of the United Kingdom --
Meanwhile, opposers passed by Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the city center.
Several activists swinged banners - Conservatives against Brexit - when they started the group with these outliers.
The Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives because security problems arose after the opening of the conference through their party program.
\"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland.\" He commented.
- It's full of farce.
Nothing good about Brexit, added it.
Warren plans to think seriously about chatting for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would think seriously about chatting for the presidency.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, at a general meeting in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, chatted in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dill, who was co-chaired by Trump in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as a prime candidate to fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting was held with voters in the format of general assemblies since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that “it is time for women to go to Washington to set up the government’s work, for which there must be a woman ”
Suspected to have been killed with basketball gun, LSJ Taggers - Simsa
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police reported that they had arrested a suspected basketball gunman, LSU Tigers, Vida Sims, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police officer announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday they published a video of a shooting request to help identify the person on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot at Sautern University campus on Friday morning.
“Vade Sims was shot in the head and killed as a result ” stated 247sports to police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was identified as being at the scene of the crime, carrying weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Authority.
Sims, who was six feet tall and six inches tall and who was performing in the Junior League, grew up in Baton Rouge, and played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and averaged 17.4 minutes for playing the field, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Lewis Hamilton cut short the standout for the title of the world champion after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment that Waltery Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes ’ decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas did a good job of starting out with a field post office and almost bypassed Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fette went to the pit-foot first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to solve everything.
The crew of Mercedes went through another circle and left behind Fettel, but Hemilton burst into the leaders after a certain wheel maneuver, leaving Ferrari reluctantly behind the inside because of the risk that he would be stalled after a double maneuver had led him to step forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and remained seventh to the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race, since he did not change his tires quickly to finish and shift Kimi Reikkonen from the fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit-stop on the 44th wheel, but he couldn't increase the pace by the last eight, making Reikkonen sit fourth.
“ It’s a hard day, because Walterie was on a full weekend, and she showed me her virtues when she gave me the opportunity to travel.
The team did a unique job of sitting down first and second place, \"\" said Hemilton.
The Body’s Speech Was Not Impressed
On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finestein for her firm position that she did not disclose Christine Blazey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Britta Cavanaugh Supreme Court of Sexual Violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated human “substitution, irresponsibility and lyingness” .
“ The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that are going on in the Senate for the last few days, ” he said, “is anger.
“ You look at the publications and the information, and then they say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
It's not me.\"
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you share the information?
Guess her answer... you've been posting the documents?
Oh, no.
I haven't said it.\"
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't say, \"added it by copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finestone received a letter explaining the charges raised by Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September his contents were made public, but Feynstein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
“ I didn’t hide the charges of Dr. Ford, and I didn’t disclose the information I had received from her — I told Finestein to the committee, reports The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn’t break my promises. ”
However, her objection did not seem to please the president, who commented during the Sabbath: “I will tell you, her body language was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't, but I haven't seen anyone stay worse yet.
Continuing to protect a candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that Democrats used accusations of their own ends.
\"They are determined to regain power by whatever means they need.
You see the underworld, the indecency, they don't have to be offended, they have to go through, they have to get power and control, they don't have to go through the mediaite quoting the president's words.

Douier took the Jayants advantage before the first break, throwing his second devil at the end of the first period.
The stewards of the field regrouped, and Bushar at twenty - eighth minute (27:37) compared the account again, throwing the highway when his team was overwhelmingly overwhelming.
Thanks to the efforts of Cone and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first led the Dandi forward and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
Friday's team, Janets, who's already lost four out of the last five games, is playing a ride game against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic traffic control was destroyed so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller was declared a hero after he had helped to fly hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major tsunami earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The strong underground shaking continues to shake the area, and many people find themselves in the halls of Palu.
But unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower, which was very busy, at Mutiar SIS airport in Pala.
He remained in place to make sure that Flight 6321 of the Batik Air Air Air Air Company, which was then on the runway, had safely climbed into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesian Aeronaugatory Services Company, Johannes Searate, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports the ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“ We are very sad to hear about it, ” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, since a disaster mitigation agency in the country claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Siga and Butong is limited.
“ The number of victims can increase because many of the bodies are still broken and many of them cannot be reached ” said a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, where mass burials would take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six feet [6 m] high.
Military and passenger aircraft supply aid and food.
Reese Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings the body.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere
Jan Helfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross Committee, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors of the tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but things can get much worse -
Indonesia’s president Joko Odo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
You're ready,' said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared missing
The airline company that was running a flight that suffered disaster in the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared without a report, although it was reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were being evacuated safely from a sinking plane.
In air Niugini, one passenger was unable to find a position on Saturday.
The airline reports that its officials are trying to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about a passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crews after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers had stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy claimed that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was flying very low above the ground.
“ That’s very good, ” Janes said.
Janes told him that he and others had managed to get to the emergency exits on a tonic plane while he was out in the water.
He told me that the stewards panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers working near the modernization of the dock also helped in rescue operations by transporting people to shore by means of an inflated boat before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in air crashes linked to PNG-registered airlines, but it does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution took action against a man charged with burning a Mississippian woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rooulett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replicate the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulett, reports The Clarion Ledger, was told that he had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he had not been in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was the truth when he said that night at the St.ford pickup, Senford said that he was “blessing because my pickup was in Nashville. ”
Another problem was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers some two weeks before her death.
Telephone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“ He wiped it out of his life ” said Gale.
The defense must put its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be transferred later that day to the jury.

In New York City, the nanny filed an application for release, receiving a `racist' message
In New York City, the nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for discriminatory release after receiving a misaddressed message from a mother complaining that she was still one black

Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, came to her first job in 2016, was dark.
“ NO, ONE TEMNOSHKIRA ” wrote to her husband in a report.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she twice sent him to Miss Maurice.
As reported in the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt \"unfriendly\" and released Ms. Maurice, saying that their previous African-American-born nanny was not doing her job well and that instead she was waiting for a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Maurice paid for one day's work and then sent her home to Uber.
Now he's suing a couple, hoping to get a payback in the amount she would have received in six months of work with a marriage, which she was initially hired for, though without a contract, she's had to pay $1350 a day.
“ I want to show them that you don’t have to do that, ” she said on Friday and added, “I know it’s discrimination.
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple claimed that Maurice’s release was a reasonable decision because they feared that they could not trust her after the offense.
“ My wife didn’t mean what she sent.
She's not racist.
We're not racist,' reported her husband, Joel Plasco, post.
“ But would you leave your children with someone who was rude, even if that was not deliberate?
Your baby?
DROUGHT -
Comparing the lawsuit with “provoking ” Plasco said that his wife gave birth only two months ago and“ was not yet getting married. ”
- Would you avenge someone after that?
It's a bad thing, it's added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that their readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bonda Karen Yankel’s daughter, who was born almost immediately after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is hard to put herself in the place of the first book reader before she was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that the story of Padington has made --
When she told me that her father, who was an BBC operator, before the little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistically considered that his work had been rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release felt \"rejoicing and sadness\" at the same time, because Father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, which she describes as “a very important member of our family, ” Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the book becoming so popular.
“ He was a modest man and did not like to boast, ” she said.
“ But Padington was so real to him as a child of his own, that when children do something, we are proud of them, not of their own, but of our own.
I think he was looking at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
“ Nad made regular phone calls, said it was really bad that she shouldn’t have done it, ” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
“ And then Over called me and told me that she would die within the next two minutes and I should say good - bye to her.
And I did it.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you...
The medication that the doctors gave her so that her heart could continue to fight gradually stopped acting and left her body.
She died a little while before everything was turned off.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be bothered, yelling, or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
It was supposed to really keep itself in my hands...
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, flew on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe tests she had to endure.
“ Nobody knew, ” she said.
“ I went down my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.
Two grief - stricken women leave cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries leave phone number cards on the Wally Bridge, which can be supported by people, as well as messages that pray inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“ I don’t want other parents to feel like I do every day, ” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“ Everyone knew him for smiling.
They always said this smile made any room brighter
But he quit his job before he died, since he was “slow in the dark ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis relates: “I’m constantly afraid it’s going to have consequences. ”
Ms Davis has made postcards, “that people know that there are people to whom they can turn and talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk.
Miss Humphries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“ He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or the like, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed —
And on Christmas Day, he was completely downhearted, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything.
She told them that his death had been a huge trauma to them, but they should survive this: “It was devastating.
We should go to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fight...

The future of Bretta Cavanaugh hangs in the hair, the FBI starts an investigation.
“ I thought that if we could get what we asked for, ‘ time-limited and investigation - we might have some agreement, ’ stated Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was going to `disrupt ' amid an inexorable loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
The intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to try to hold their own man through the election to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned Senators to support Mr. Kavano, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush's reign, and by means of which he met his wife Ashley, who was working as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans now sit, 49 Democrats will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh could obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of crossings from North Korea was cut short.
After Kim Jong In came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawgiver South Korea’s turnout was reduced.
Pak Pion Seug, referring to data from the Republic of South Korea Department of Union, said that in the past year, the number of commuters was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were increased border controls between North Korea and China, and that illegal smugglers are now demanding more money for this.
Pyongyang refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of the winners from North Korea eventually offer South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, it was claimed that over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the runners as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, still formally in a state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed denuclearization, which was at an impasse.
This was after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Inn in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho, against the background of accepted sanctions, accused the United States of having no progress since then.
“With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so there can be no language of unilateral disarmament under these circumstances,” said Ri Jon-Ho in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavanaugh a hysterical and says he doesn't deserve to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate for the office of Judge Bretta Cavano - hysterical of the Supreme Court and said that he did not qualify for temperament in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I kept thinking that if a woman had ever done this, she would have been called hysterical.” Pelosi commented on her reaction to the Cavanaugh Testimony witness before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charge of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Cavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and estranged, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “absurable and coordinated destruction of reputation — by organized liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost his 2016 presidential election.
In Pelosi’s view, the Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
“I think by these statements, as well as by his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will stand for his candidacy,” she said.
He was outraged when she was asked if she would try to declare Cavanaugh an impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether he would receive the Democrats most of the House of Representatives.
“ I’ll say that if he doesn’t tell the truth of the Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he works now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavano is now a U.S. Court of Appeal judge in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the law on access to medical care, or the Roe v. Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the issue of confirmation at the Kavano office, he sided with the question as to whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“ It is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, prejudiced person and we will say how wonderful it is, ” said Pelosi.
Women should possess these weapons.
They were just words that contained months and years of rage, and she could not say them without tears.
“ We cry when we are angry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s unusual, but you’re...
She continued: “One woman who worked with an executive director somewhere and helped me a lot, said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the householder, ‘ You can think that I’m sad and that I’m crying.
And I am evil.\"
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible...
Tears are considered to be the acceptable way out of anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first job in the office, where men were mostly employed, was the situation when I once cried indescribable anger, and an older woman, an unfriendly manager, who I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by my collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
“ They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad to get to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a democracy congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out-of-marriage on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
“ It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision, ” she said with laughter 30 years later.
“ There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed...
Someone called the situation \"Billow and Seven Dwarves\" -
Since she was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the congregation, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had spared $1,000 in support of their husbands, gave her only $250.
“ They think they're gonna give me a discount, ” she was surprised.
When she gave a talk and announced that she would not engage in an official campaign, she was moved to express her appreciation for the people who supported her, to the disappointment of the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and made her not so much for voters as members of the Chamber of Deputies, but also for the anger of sexism, and she was willing to cry.
“ You would think I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schroeder’s reaction to the press. “
You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone?
\"She wept?'--
How the United States - China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and, although far from completion, in the long run, divisions between countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. president Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest situation this week has been the new $200 billion (150 billion) tariff, which is actually taxing half of all products coming into the United States from China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently laying a five to ten percent tax on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to taking similar measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to be soon missed the opportunity to keep that promise.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but to President Xi Jinpin of China, U.S. public worship is too shameful.
But what experts think is that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the U.S. trade war with the U.S. can lead China in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A rapid political decision in Washington, D.C. or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to a sudden economic collapse in any of the countries, and that was in fact a greater threat than the observers had acknowledged earlier,” stated analyst Abigail Grace, who is dealing with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister stated that Syria was ready for return to refugees
In Syria, refugees are said to be ready to return voluntarily and to seek help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem stated that conditions are improving in the country.
“ Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist - torn areas so that people can return to normal lives.
All the conditions were now created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that had to be abandoned through terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept aid in restoring the war-torn country.
But he pointed out that they would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that support the rebellion.
Europe consolidates the victory in the “Ryder Cup ” in Paris
The European team conquered the Rider's Cup in 2018, when they defeated the U.S. team with a total score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated for the sixth time in Europe and has not won the Rider's Cup since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, picked up 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Miquelson, who tried most of the tournament, hit his first long shot on the 16th hole of steam-3 in the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of four players who had ever held a 5 - 0 - 0 score since the 1979 modern format tournament.
An American named Jordan Spitt was defeated with a score of 5:4 by a player with the lowest rating on the European team Turbierne Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world ranking, gave up 2:1 Jan Poulter of England, who may have participated in the Rider's Cup for the last time.
The Spanish, Sergio García, a veteran of the Ryder Cup -- who had already participated in the tournament eight times -- became a European who won the most of his time in tournaments, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
“ I usually don’t cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a hard year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad it's so nice to get the cup back.
That's the team's credit, and I'm happy to be able to help.
He passes the estaphet to his countryman John Rema, who, on Sunday, won the American legend of Tiger Woods in a lonely game with a score of 2:1.
“ I feel incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy, ” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record in the Rider's Cup - 13 - 21 - 3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Meijore tournaments, only yield to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. congregation tried all weekends to reach the fervre, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high - class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furik of the United States said of his team after a gruesome performance: “I am proud of these guys, they have fought.
This morning we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, and I'm working with the U.S. Golf Association and the Board of the Rider's Cup, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being their captain.
They should not be praised.
We've lost -
