How long have these symptoms been present?
and all chest pains should be treated in this way, especially in light of your age
and with a high temperature
and also need to check your cholesterol and arterial pressure
And do you have a high temperature now?
and do you now feel this pain in your chest?
Besides, do you have difficulty breathing?
and can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides these?
and how high your temperature was
And I've got a cough.
And I have a little cough cold.
And I'm really in pain in my chest today.
and whether this time corresponds to the manifestation of a sleeping fever to which you are exposed
and chest pain occurs
And I think I got a little cold.
and I want you to describe where your chest is in.
and they also have a slightly elevated temperature
and with your diabetes history
And you know, it feels like my chest's gonna be crushed.

Any other symptoms or problems you've noticed that are associated with muscle pain?
Do you have other patients with the same symptoms at home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you now feel the breath?
Do you still suffer pain in your chest?
Because it's the flu season.
But also we must not be overlooked by the presence of chest pain, which is cardiological in nature.
But now the more important problem is this chest pain
But I'm having trouble breathing.
But I know a lot of people are coughing at me.
But we have to treat any pain in the chest with the utmost seriousness
But you're breathing well now, aren't you?
Because I don't remember the pain in my chest anymore.
Does it look like someone's pushing your chest?
You're still feeling the breath.
Do they complain about the symptoms of bad feelings?
Do you have any other chronic diseases like high arterial pressure or something like that?

I got a fever last night.
I also got a little cold last night.
I had temperature last night.
I'm in pain here in my chest.
I also have a little bit of trouble breathing.
I'll send you an image.
I'm having some chest pain today
I'm having a little headache today, and the temperature has risen.
I think it's flu.
I think it's a light flu.
Does it sound like a very heavy person sitting on your neck?
All of this started almost simultaneously with headaches and rising temperature
I'm in pain in the middle of my chest.
It sucks like a chest pain.
It's in my chest.
It's in the middle of my chest.
It's in the middle of the chest.
I'm in pain in my chest.

I want you to describe this chest pain.
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
As exactly in the middle of the chest.
from the high temperature, you can now take the tachypirin in the shape of icebreakers.
Now, Mary, tell me how many days you've been showing these symptoms.
Now you said you felt pain in your chest.
From time to time, I feel a little chest pain
Well, do you have any other symptoms besides pain?
Or someone sitting on your chest?
Same high temperature and cough, headache and muscle
The pain is directly in the middle of my chest.
Show me on this image where you feel pain
Because you have a high temperature.
So you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, do your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
temperature rising at night

You know, I have diabetes and all that.
You said you were suffering from this chest pain.
The rapid increase in coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / Economic Zone of Europe and the United Kingdom, thus reaffirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries despite different stages of its development.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and offices of intensive care, there is a need to increase their patient preparedness with COVID-19, which will require treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, Uhan province of Hubei, China, reported several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethics.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection was a new type of coronavirus, now known as 2nd-type acute respiratory syndrome Cronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has come to be referred to as the Coronary Infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80% of people from COVID-19 have a mild infection, i.e., infection with or without pneumonia, and most of those who have contracted the disease.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe illness with the need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The rate of death of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses the trends in the cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the United Kingdom and compares them with those in the Province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and in the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and the United Kingdom
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world in the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe were reported by Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues on 5 March 2020, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEZ were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three patients returning from Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been reported in all 30 EU/EEZ countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases of infection reported between 31 December 2019 and 1,727, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, accounted for Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in every country of the world daily from official sources such as the health ministries of those countries, national and regional health administrations and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
The rate of prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated as an indicator of the cumulative cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 within 14 days, taking into account the usual current of COVID-19 in each EU/EEZ country and in Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also presented a cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at 80.00 on 15 March 2020, compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Development Trends in EU/EEA and Great Britain
Trends in the development of the comprehensive cumulative disease COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU/EEZ countries and in the UK as a whole were consistent with the trends in the Province of Hubei in China (Figure 1).
The cumulative disease of COVID-19 in the EU/EEZ and in the UK as a whole began to rise on about 21 February and there was a sharp leap of this figure (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEZ countries and in Britain there were similar trends in the cumulative disease COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEZ countries and in Britain, compared with the same figure for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Britain is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEZ and in the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is in spite of different stages in different countries, differences in response by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of illness and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of COVID-19, including “inverting” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive treatment, and the media indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
At present, only 6% and 1% of cases (not reported) are available for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals and (or) in intensive care offices in the EU/EEA.
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current monitoring data, the number of cases recorded and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there are significant variations in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC risk-assessment report on COVID-19 presents scenarios for modelling the loading of health system resources with estimates for hospitalization of COVID-19 infected persons in each EU/EEZ country and in the UK, where the risk of a lack of accessable beds in intensive care offices exceeds 90%.
As cases are now grouped by region of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care offices usually serve the population of a given territorial group, information on infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided, as far as possible, at Nomenclature 2 of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the British.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices should be prepared for the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 contact infections, which have continued and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive treatment, which can be seen in the affected regions of Italy, for example.
As reported in the last ECDC report on the impact of rapid risk assessment, the rapid, proactive and integrated approach to curb the spread of SARS-COV-2 may not be enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, adopt and adjust their response accordingly unless such measures are taken in advance.
The risk-assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks of health care in other EU/EEZ countries, there will be an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The COVID-19 outbreak of Coronavirus infection (SARS) type 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has been a tragedy for mankind: to date, over 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the SARS-CoV homologous virus, which developed severe acute respiratory syndrome for thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and produce similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is lower in severity and lower in mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject is proposed in this article.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable occasion for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of a new virus infection.
In view of the high similarity between the Coronavirus (CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease Coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, followed by almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had been cured, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “an enemy of one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), over 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on his virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus allocated to a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to consolidate research results in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other Coronavirus-induced disease, the Cronavier of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss evidence of disease prevention and prediction at this time, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have been traditionally pathogens that are not fatally dangerous to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have experienced twice the high-pathogenic coronaviruses of humans, that is, the Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first reporting on pneumonia cases of unknown origin was made available to the National Commission of Health of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health workers were informed that they were infected, suggesting that the virus could be passed on to humans.
On 23 January, the quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and the city ' s public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, according to a first clinical study of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with a confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak was a global public health emergency.
At the time of preparation of the report, the disease spread throughout China and had already infiltrated approximately 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of risk of outbreaks have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has been infected by all age groups, but it is mainly among those between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age and few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 have not yet reached the age of 10.
Inflecting SARS-CoV-2 among men above (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days had elapsed prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 symptoms.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2).
The average day was 9.5 (4.8 - 13) from the time of symptoms prior to death.
The baseline rate for reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who had coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
Mortality among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%), while the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: sex (male), age (60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large membrane viruses containing one single string of meaningful RNA.
These can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to be striking.
In the case of coronavirus type SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the membrane-like schiposide (S) is linked to the cell receptors of angiotensin-transducing enzyme of type 2 (ACE2) and dippedylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm releases the viral RNA genome; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the membrane glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane releasing the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenced reports appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been established to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with a genome of 99.98 per cent matching 10 consecutive samples collected at the first end of the outbreak of the disease in the Huhan Marine Products Market.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of educational electronic microscopy, parts of SARS-CoV-2 have been found in the ultra thin cuts of the human respiratory epithet.
It has been determined that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the enzyme ACE2 is weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients with lower levels of severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and secreted protein encoded orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors, led by Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the cryoelectric scan of the structure of a full-sized ACE2 enzyme, with the authorization of 2.9 Å in a complex containing B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that the complex, which included open and closed conformations, was collected as a diemer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which proved that the coronavirus was recognized and infected.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origins and Intermediate Hostage
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats from which the virus was transmitted to the human via a flower and camel, respectively.
By means of a phylogenetic comparison, SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two known SARS coronaviruses, namely, SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what species has become an intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to overcome a type of barrier and infect a human being, and the transmission path remains to be discovered.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the carriers of the virus from flying mice to humans were snakes, during which there was homologous recombination in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins — long-horned mammals that feed on ants that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the coronavirus of the Pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% between both genomes is still very large, so final results with specific evidence are not yet considered (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at below 20 °C and 40-50 per cent of humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating for up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlor-containing disinfectants, peruxic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorohexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have the immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed immune response studies have been conducted for SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, the host virus first recognizes the innate immune system by means of image-recognizing receptors (ORRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus triggers expression of inflammation factors, the growth of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages with regard to virus antigens.
However, the N-white SARS-CoV can avoid immune response.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
The helper T cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by causing their programmed death.
Human immunity, which includes components such as C3a, C5a, and antibodies, is also important in combating the virus infection.
For example, antibodies from a cured patient have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system has resulted in a large number of free radicals at the local level, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and could lead to polyorgan insufficiency and even death in the worst scenario.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune system impairments.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, a study based on a population of 8,866 cases revealed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the dates of quarantine measures, taking into account the exactest calculations of the duration of the incubation period, so as to prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease unsymptomized.
A 14-day quarantine was common practice for people who had contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The principal and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, throat pain, smog, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and rhubarb.
Some patients suffered from dyslexia and (or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coaglopacy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptom prevalence rates: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing and 3% diarrhea; 8% patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from non-symptomatic infected persons.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had major symptoms of high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%), and dizziness (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, a figure much higher than that of patients with COVID-19 and higher than that of MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dipping (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%), and artificial lung ventilation requires 14-20%.
As at 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, while the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
Compared with this, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed.
In the case of MERS, a population study in June 2012 showed that 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed deaths were reported.
According to a earlier study, the baseline rate of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was set at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was at only 2 to 4 intervals.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher prevalence capacity for SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but mortality rate for new viruses is lower than the last two.
It will therefore be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustering often occurs when infected within a family or group of people gathered together for any reason or caught together on any kind of transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there, or contacted the infected or sick within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to reports, people may be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, while patients who have been discharged from the hospital may again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced quantities of white cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had white blood cells < 4x109/L, including those with white cells < 1x109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin aminotransferase and virus.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver, muscle, and myoglobin enzymes in their blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cells.
The D-dimer level, the fibrin product present in the blood, has been increased in patients with a severe disease, and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily reduced.
For most patients with COVID-19, breast X-ray studies have detected pathology characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or \"math glass\" eclipses in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung damage and severe respiratory disease (ORS).
During the development of ODS, uncontrolled ignition, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis have resulted in a significant disruption of gas exchange.
The function of pneumotites types I and II reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung succession.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most serious cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the deposition of pneumotites, the formation of gialin membranes and inter-wet lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear synthetic cells in lung patients who died of disease corresponded to viral infection and ODS pathology and similar to those found with SARS and MERS.
The method of detection of RNA SARS-CoV-2 was used as the main criterion in diagnosing COVID-19 by means of a polymerase feedback chain with reverse transcriptase.
However, given the high level of false criticism that could accelerate the epidemic, the diagnosis of clinical manifestations in China began on 13 February 2020 (not relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The diagnosis of SARS was similar.
Thus, in order to be able to diagnose effectively, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the history of illness, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray studies.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a CRISPR-based protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 with a density of 20 × 10 - 18 moles/l to 200 × 10 - 18 moles/l (10 - 100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) less than one hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if tested successfully on clinical drugs, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience in coping with the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly only provide patients with COVID-19 with supporting therapy, while trying to use any therapeutic methods used or offered to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic techniques include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of cured patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop anti-virus antibodies and vaccines.
During the early stages of SARS-CoV-2, attacks mainly the lungs and may be less affected by other organs that express ACE2, e.g. the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, job disruption and refusal of breathing organs are a major threat and cause of death to patients.
Thus, maintenance of the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, noninvasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, are critical to relieve symptoms and save lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary bleeding used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital functions, is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunocytes to release large quantities of free radicals, which are the main cause of ODS and poly organ deficiency.
Oppression of immunity is essential in treating the cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition.
Corticosteroids and tociliumabs, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other treatments for cytokine storm treatment based on immunity suppression include modulation of immune response to control of T cells; blockage of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of janus kinase; use of blinatummaba, cytokine supressors 4 and hystondeacetalas inhibitors.
In order to reduce the gravity of the effects of inflammatory processes, the SARS virus is widely used as a contributor to immunity.
However, large-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung damage to patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteoporosis, which significantly diminishes the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of a remediciary, a nucleotid analog, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Giled for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remodicle also showed the possibility of suppressing other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, the company Guilead has provided China ' s medical staff with a view to conducting paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are encouraging.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, loppinavier/ritonavier and ribavirin were offered as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined lung/ritonavier treatment may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibodies
Blood intake for patients with communicable diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population has long been applied.
Indeed, the blood of cured patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to combat pathogens.
Antibodys are found in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize and target individual pathogen molecules.
Based on this assumption, plasma from blood samples of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 was identified, which was then introduced to 10 seriously ill patients.
During 24 hours their symptomatics improved, inflammation decreased, and viral load increased, as well as oxygen saturation.
However, in order to propose massive use of this method prior to conducting specific therapy, it is necessary that no verification or clarifications have been made so far.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some of the deficiencies associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma to treat patients in critical condition requires much.
It is not easy to develop and develop specific antibodies quickly enough to cope with the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify B cells of cured patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move on to the mass production of antibodies right away.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, whose composition differs according to the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as it is difficult to assign and test these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific therapy, COVID-19 Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms, or for patients with post severe illness.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Zie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of patients with COVID-19 has been reported in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87 per cent of patients, including Ghana (63.7 per cent), Ninzi (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only approximately 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of those cured (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is quite a rough comparison, since the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively on Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, withdrawal of symptoms and hospital care had a markedly lower rate of treatment for patients with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the percentage of patients who began to deteriorate (from a slight to a severe condition) was markedly lower in the group, which was treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group treated only in Western medicine (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more rigorously controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
Some interest is also given to obtain, where possible, a description of the mechanism of action and to explain the effectiveness or combination of components used in Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients suspected of or confirmed of having COVID-19 are generally afraid of acute or even fatal illness, and people confined to quarantine are also bored, lonely and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
During the early stages of the outbreak of SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor seizures, psychotic symptoms, delicacies and even suicidal behaviour, were reported.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, which is one of the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and feelings of guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
Consequently, patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as all the other people who require them, should be given psychological and psychiatric care.
Psychological support should develop multidisciplinary psychiatric teams, provide clear information on the regular and accurate updating of information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from the carrier animals and infected people to the receptive hosts and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to control epidemics caused by the new viruses.
S-protein vaccines have been developed to develop long-lasting and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weakened vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to clinical research, it is necessary to further determine the effectiveness of these possible naturally occurring vaccines for age patients, the fatal dose infection model and the degree of protection against zoonosal virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic incidents and clusters of MERS disease are still occurring in the Middle East, spreading to other regions as a result of the conservation of zoonosy sources in the habitats of endemics.
Intensified virus, DNA plasmids, virus bundles, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins have been developed to combat MERS, and some have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task requiring a solution to the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long (average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and to the dynamic modification of the Coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical flow of disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to heal progressively without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognosis model to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the forecast of disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by SARS, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study 8,866.
Patients who required intensive treatment were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were much older than patients who did not require treatment (or 66 years vs. 51 years), indicating that age is a prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: The infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher than that of women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Diseases and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia injuries.
Cardiological events have also been the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be linked to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in blood reflect the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and are suggested to be a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and permanent recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, severity of disease and COVID-19 prediction should be taken into account.
In addition, the results can also be predicted by elevated lactatdehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferases, alanine-aminotransferases and creatines.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms are that, in order to predict results and complications in treating COVID-19, X-ray imaging and clinical symptoms should be taken into account, along with other factors.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors commonly used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were used extensively to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteoporosis that caused life disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unpredictable severe stress because they often have to endure prolonged periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty and see the deaths of relatives and other patients.
In order to alleviate the stress of such patients and help them return to normal lives, they must be provided with psychological counselling and long-term support.
According to population studies currently under way, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory pathways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other common cold coronary viruses, can reproduce successfully in the upper respiratory pathways and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of illness or have not yet reached the end of the incubation period may, by living their normal lives, distribute the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological control significantly difficult.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, with in most cases no infection occurring at an early stage.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic and is harder to control.
China is currently working hard to declare universal quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend quarantine to almost all the population set up to break the chain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients who have been identified has decreased, which has shown that the epidemic has slowed down.
The most optimistic calculation of the outbreak will end in March and the congestion phase will last three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter, with his colleagues, calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which seemed much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian specialist group reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in monkeys from the nose and throats of patients who had been cured and discharged from hospitals for two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China was encouraging, pointing out that the current strategies might have had an impact.
According to the original projections, Ebola fever had to strike up to a million people and cause half a million patients to die.
But severe quarantine and isolation eventually controlled the disease.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the inflationary ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can weaken and it will disappear over time or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with the human.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with those of SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high transfer speeds through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in kale, which means that the oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from hospital infection, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreign, patient or infected workers.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is masking; both surgical masks and class N95 repeaters (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow the microcaps of liquid from potentially infected persons to disintegrate into the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only masks of the N95 class (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as the SARS-CoV and both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks put together, doctors directly involved with patients must wear a Class N95 mask (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear protective robe in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a Class N95 mask; the virus may have been infected through burning eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent faceboards or closed-type protective glasses.
It is strongly recommended that all populations in the affected or potentially threatened regions spend more frequently on the common use of disinfected means, stay away from home in self-insulation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
The acceptable distance to a patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, its high similarity to the SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be an alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until after 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center for Disease Control in Uhan reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproduction in human transmission and that the prevention and control of the disease would not pose a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially during the time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Uhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as each word is taken into account by citizens and may influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than calm the public; and (4) conduct more often targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to monitor regularly and improve the social response system.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by an previously unexplored coronavirus of severe type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China, and at the time of writing, it had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has produced a sense of retardation of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion and mortality rate of older persons is also higher than that of young people.
SARS deaths are higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even in a non-symptomatic disease, while patients with SARS usually infect the environment only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to contain COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and more massive than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for the presence of RNA SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, treated patients can again show positive tests for the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of such rapid progression of COVID-19 studies, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96 per cent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like coronaviruses of the flying mice, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 occurred from the flying mice.
What kind of animal was an intermediate species that passed the virus from an original host, such as a flying mouse, to a human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular-level modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus enter the respiratory cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human transmission?
Will it cause the world pandemic, or will it also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically recidate like a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to answer these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of the Coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a lung disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how disastrous and life-threatening a person's coronavirus can be.
The emergence of a coronavirus of severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 has once again attracted attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with a high tolerance but a weaker pathogen than the SARS-CoV related virus.
Coronary human infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonal origin will be very helpful.
The majority of human coronaviruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carrier reservoirs for some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of animal bearers with the Coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the Coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonal origins and methods of inter-visible transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the present-day epidemic of the Coronavirus disease, discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is also being addressed.
In addition, there are conditions necessary for the successful change of carriers and the impact of the virus's evolution on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar RNA string.
These viruses, with the largest RNA-containing virus genome of between 26 and 32,000 nucleoids, have been named because of their shape, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a crown.
From a structural point of view, the Cronavirs contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large, open, partial reading overlaps (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in the polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1ab replicas.
These polyproteins are subsequently recycled to generate 16 unstructured proteins, termed nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including spiked protein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other Crown lines also encode a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, the coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses), with the species betacoronaviruses comprising the majority of human coronaviruses and being divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are bats and rodents, while birds are the primary reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, the Coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved to the danger of pathogens.
To date, there are seven human coronaviruses.
These include HCoV-29E and HCoV-NL63 human alphacoronaviruses.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-29E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause light-form symptoms, such as colds and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory disease (ORS) and extreme symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCoV-29E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from a noxule of patients with cold disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were treated, with an overall death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, is the cause of the current COVID-19 epidemic, which claimed over 3,120 lives as at 3 March 2020, with over 91,000 infected.
The alarm signal is received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zoonosy origin and are sources of flying mice, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets indicate the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties but exhibit widespread genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic left China and the world with a harsh medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
The study of the zoonal machinery of origin of the human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors limiting inter-visibility.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a reservoir intermediate and amplicating SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides an overview of the zoonous origin, inter-visibility transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses have occurred are usually not pathogenic to their reservoirs but become pathogenic after the inter-visible transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend in human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also being considered in the same context.
Animal corals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-29E strain was first obtained from a sample of prosperous patients separated from the nosoglot, various coronaviruses were found in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Over the past few decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative account of the chronological discovery of human coronaviruses.
The first strain of the HCoV-29E virus was obtained from tests taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious damage to the upper respiratory pathways in 1966; the virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-29E were diagnosed with cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general nausea and pain in their throats, while high temperatures and coughs were observed in 10 - 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was released from organic culture and subsequent serialization into the brains of the sower mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-29E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as type A influenza viruses and Rhinviruses.
Both the HCoV-29E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are common throughout the world and are generally transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks.
According to a study on volunteers, a common light cold developed among healthy people infected with HCoV-29E virus.
Few patients with weakened immunity were exposed to severe infection of the lower respiratory tracts.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history, caused by the coronavirus, and the cause of disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was reported in the Chinese province of Guangdun in late 2002.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
Without the consideration of superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more persons; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the viral load peak was 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV had initial muscle pains, headaches, high temperature, general indigestion and chilling, and among the later symptoms were respiratory, cough and respiratory failure.
The prevalent deviations of laboratory indicators from SARS are lymphoppies, ingestions in foam samples and elevated creatininase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proprioception of epidermal cells, and a rise in macrophages.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, livers and kidneys, may be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be volatile, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from an open biopsy of a sick relative who had arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to research human coronavirs.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was first determined that it mainly affects young children, older persons and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such forms as smog, causing, temperature and bronchitis.
Another independent study describes the identification of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been discovered in the Netherlands, but it is in fact widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, while early summer, spring and winter have a peak of disease.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to obstructive laryngitis, also referred to as a collapse.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchialitis.
In addition to pain-free pneumonia and bronchiole, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-29E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which is a lung respiratory disease, has been detected worldwide.
All these four coronaviruses of non-patient infections have adapted well to people, and their mutation, with high-pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were also unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infection of lower respiratory tracts in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first allocated in 2012 to a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there are foreign cases and occasional secondary infections in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) recall the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which so far distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human coronary disease.
More than 30 per cent of patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nervosa.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high-death Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%) had been registered, and therefore MERS-CoV was considered one of the most lethal viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, Uhan province of Hubei, China, identified clusters of pneumonia patients, which are now linked to infections caused by type 2 coronary acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in the past.
The World Health Organization announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global public health emergency, and the disease itself was termed “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, accounting for approximately 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the China province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and outside of Hubei is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection, which is characterized by a rise in temperature, cough and dizziness.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly enter acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleoside sequences (82%), these viruses still form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a greater transfer capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been recorded, indicating that the virus is rapidly spreading throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human transmitted Cronavirus have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the remaining six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, COVID-19 symptoms are among SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses causing non-communicable infections (i.e. HCoV-29E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those most commonly observed in human coronaviruses, which cause non-communicable infections, including nonspecific manifestations, lung symptoms, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-CoV, a small subset of COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both for human coronaviruses causing non-communicable infections and for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing non-communicable infections.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with each subsequent virus (i.e. infection of each next person) is reduced, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause non-patient infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the kola samples.
We have yet to answer a question as to whether the fecal-oral transfer route of SARS-CoV-2 is as valid (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses, which cause non-poor infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the specificities of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses, which produce non - hospital infections with lung symptoms, have adapted well to people.
On the other hand, they may have adapted well to these four human coronators.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of the human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause serious diseases in humans, and people who have severe human coronaviruses have simply not survived.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be reposed into the human body to a sufficient extent for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that oppose the limiting factors of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the explosion of SARS-CoV-2 lasts and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus will be fully adaptable to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people through quarantine or other communicable disease control activities.
Over the years, four out-of-patient coronaviruses are circulating among the population, causing normal colds for people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoire animal.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission to humans cannot be maintained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoonosy reservoirs and look for cases where human targets are sensitive, perhaps through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features like both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four non-poor HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as a non-poor HCoV, at least at present.
But it's more pathogenic than extraterrestrial HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether he is fully adapted to human beings and whether he will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and backup carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it transmits a close ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The precursor virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reservoire carries HCoV continuously over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only taken into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was carried on the person, it was not well adapted to the new bearing and often pathogenic.
This intermediate bearing can serve as a zoning source of human infection and can serve as an increasing carrier, allowing the virus to replicate itself and then transmit it to people, increasing the number of people infected.
HCoV can undergo a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate bearing and even set long-term endemic conditions.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data have shown that zero SARS patients had contact with hunting animals (wild) in the anemone.
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher for animal traffickers than for the general population.
The Himalayan chives (Pagoma larvata) and the raccoon dog in living animals markets were the first established carriers of viruses, such as almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that the SARS cases were no longer reported after the destruction of all the civilizations in the markets.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cyvet, which lived in nature or on farms and did not fall into markets, was in most cases not determined by the SARS-CoV, which suggests that the Himalayan cyvet could serve only as an intermediate reinforcing medium rather than the natural shell of the SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou's markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate boosters.
They're all like dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for natural carrier animal, SARS-CoV, discovered a nearby CoV by flying mice called the atypical pneumonia-related coronavirus by sub-shelled flying mice HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese sub-shell flying mice.
These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of the bat have between 88 and 92 per cent the same homology of nucleoside sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in the flying mice, but none of them but one that is designated WIV1 cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 derived from a sample of volatile mice uses ACE2 bats, cywits and humans as a receptor for entry into the cell.
It's curious that the serums of exorbitant patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest native SARS-CoV ancestor in the flying mice, separating 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally not believed to be the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis refers to MERS-CoV to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bats and the CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipptildieptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase sequence of the MERS-CoV virus is phylogenetically closer to the betacoronavirus sequences of volatile mice found in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of MERS-CoV nucleopid sequences and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, matches only 87 per cent.
So, flying mice might not have been the direct backup carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are seropositive to neutralize antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in humans, was removed from single-stranded tentacles, further confirming the role of camels as the true reservoirs of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimented with MERS-CoV had slight symptoms but massive viruses.
Notably, infected camels have identified the virus not only in a respiratory way but also in a fecal-oral way, which is also the main way in which the virus is released from flying mice.
However, there are still issues, since many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have contact with camels in the anamenum before the symptoms occur and are certainly related to human transmission or transmission by unknown channels including non-established species of animals that are MERS-CoV carriers.
The homology of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotids is 96.2 per cent the same as the CoV RaTG13 of the volatile mice allocated in the Asian rhinolofus affinis subshells.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the convergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to their parental relationships.
So the bats might not have been the direct reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaviruses of the bats were found in the future.
The direct carrier animals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are supposed to be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhanese market for seafood, which has been linked to many of the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating that there is likely to be a transfer from an animal to an animal.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoronavirus, a related SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the sequences of the nucleosides of these new genomes of the coronavirus of the pangolins is 85 to 92 per cent in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RaTG13, with approximately 90 per cent of the identity at the nucleoside sequence level.
They are classified in two sub-fields of differentiation between viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-linking domain (RSD) that is closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an identical amino acid sequence at 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more diversified despite the higher homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of Pangolin patients also reported on the identification of viral contagions in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce genome sequencing, which included about 86.3 per cent of the full-blown virus genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, owing to the diversion of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolins betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established with bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the betacoronaviruses of the SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposing proposal is in favour of recombination between the betacoronavirus of the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonous origin of HCoV-29E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-29E can occur from the coronaviruses of flying mice, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
The coronavirus of flying mice called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and the North American tri-coloured spruce have been reported to show a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-29E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of flying mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that camels could be its intermediate carrier.
To clarify modern knowledge of animal origin, known coronaviruses are summarized in figure 1 and in table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the inter-visible HCoV transmission in the anemone.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus was intervisible about 1890 and people were infected with domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of the HCoV-29E intervisibility is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of flying mice, close-born HCoV-29E, were found.
There is an alpha-coronavirus of the alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from human mice.
First, it was the people, not the alpacas, who were able to communicate with the bats in the overall ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, the alphacoronaviruses of the flying mice related to HCoV-29E have diverse and nonpathogenic mice, while the alphacoronavirus alpaca caused a respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphacoronavirus of the alpaca was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpacas received an alpha-coronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the scourge virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronaviruses of the flying mice could serve as the gene pool of the HCoV-29E virus, the alpacas and single camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit the virus to humans, as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-COV provides an excellent example of an inter-visible transmission from flying mice to one-armed camels and from one-stranded camels to a human.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent research.
Clearly, bats provide a rich pool of viruses for inter-visible exchange of manure fragments and inter-visible transmission.
Long, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make flying mice “ideal promoters”.
The MERS-CoV virus, on the other hand, was introduced to single camels a decade ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from an intermediate carrier have become a stable and natural reservoir.
The MERS-CoV virus in these animals causes very slight disease and is relatively low mutation rate.
His occasional human transmission is an accident and the human remains a dead end for MERS-CoV, as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the betacoronaviruses of the pangolins are highly pathogenic from the pangolins.
They may be dead-end carriers of beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cevettes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-visible transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the animal must be confirmed or eliminated.
First, flying mice can be a backup carrier for a virus born to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with bats, either by coal mining or by separating the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolins can be an intermediate reinforcing medium in which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently hit.
People are infected by virus through carcases and by eating wild animals.
SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be host to many animals, including domestic animals.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on the antibody is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could take place in a third form, which was in contact with both the flying mice and the pangolins.
Search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin continues.
In addition to different types of animal, three main factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-sectional barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated coronavirus mutation rate can be considered \"moderate-high\" with an average rate of replacement of approximately 10-4 replacements per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a correct exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high rates of mutation and weakening or even incapacity.
Interestingly, the nucleoside analog Remdesir suppresses the replication of the coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdeissir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2, which must be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not sufficiently adapted to the wearer.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparent below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
The virus is said to have adapted to another bearing close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies also to MERS-CoV, which is well-suited to single camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will rapidly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in the coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-visible coevolution favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under conditions.
Many unique open-ended frameworks of protein reading and function, coded in the direction of the 3rd end of the genome, contribute to this.
Third, through a unique matrix selection mechanism, the coronaviruses are randomly switched and often switched matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of DNA, the coronavirus in the nose, which serves as a mixing vessel, often involves the switching of filaments.
High-level full-length and subgenome RNAs can recombine and create new cRNAs.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animals called coronaviruses, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction of virus carrier with regard to transfer
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important to inter-visible transmission.
In this article, the recombination of SARS-CoV is provided as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-visible transmission.
On the basis of comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV strains of humans and the Civets, SARS-CoV is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to the mutations on the S RSD.
In general, RSD protein S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and the carrier's antibody response actively selects it.
RSD at SARS-CoV is amino acids, 318 to 510th, in S1 fragment, which binds to the angiotensing enzyme 2 (APF2) of the person, as well as to its receptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
The RSD of the SARS-CoV virus is able to recognize the receptors of APF2 from different animals, including the flying mouse, the chives, mice and the raccoon dog, making inter-visible transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, RSD found only 6 amino acid residues that differ from human and cervical virus strains, of which 4 are in a receptor-related motive for interacting with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV cybets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which can enhance the affinity of spiked protein interactions with human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 segment of protein S causes protein S to change affinity for human APF2 to change.
Indeed, a cryoelectric microscope study says that the affinity for this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than that between APF2 and S virus SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correlators were needed for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCoV-NL63 is also associated with APF2 but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other receptors for HCoV, such as Aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-Acetyl acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after cross-division from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the inter-visible transfer of HCoV is also controlled by other dependence and restriction factors of the carrier.
Divergence of these protein carriers between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as flying mice, single-shelled camels and rodents, can constitute a barrier to inter-visible transmission.
For a successful inter-visible transmission, HCoV viruses have to usurp dependency factors and submit to carrier respiration factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be produced by the impartial full-blood screening of dependency factors and the retributory of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoV: back to zero
The diversity of the coronaviruses of the flying mice creates a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of the flying mice serve as a genetic bullet for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins, SARS-CoV is important for adaptation to humans, as the flying mice viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it has been found to encode the detergent proteins ORF8.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide mission, characterized by SARS-CoV, was found.
This is broken down by the ORF8 into the ORF8a and the ORF8b, and it is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates change in carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localizations of recombination have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-COV epidemic has been shown to have been recombinant between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs where HCOV recombined with other animals in its non-structured genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genomes, which are likely to result from the elimination of the virus from selective pressures, such as from the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of a fully fledged ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-29E strain due to a two-pronged delegation.
While the ORF4 open-ended reading frame can be seen in viruses with flying mice and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of the alpaca shows a single-nucleotide insert, resulting in a shift in the framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the case of flying mice, the coronaviruses have recorded poorly expressed symptoms or lack thereof, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronaviruses and the bats.
It turned out that the bats were anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of an inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in the flying mice has been suppressed by the preregulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is ensured by the metabolic activity of the flying mice, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus while simultaneously affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure for generating strains of virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new medium.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, resulting in new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the past twenty years, three new coronaviruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are either non-pathogenic or cause slight symptoms in their reservoirs, such as bats or camels.
They are sure to replicate without a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see non-symptomatic carriers, and what causes serious human infection.
Severe symptoms are associated mainly with the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the injury to the lungs.
On the contrary, the unsymptomatic carriers do not have the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy may have favourable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Summer mice have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the intake of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect.
NLRP3inflammoma activation was also violated in the flying mice.
On this basis, NLRP3-inflammoma inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common pattern under which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While the betacoronavirus of the flying mice was found, with a 95% nucleotide homology coincides with the SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of the flying mice, whose nucleotid homology coincides with 96% of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that the viruses identical to the SARS-CoV were carried by mats and other animals in the markets, there were no direct intermediate carriers for the SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, were found to be an intermediate carrier, or that fragments of the betacoronavirus genes of the pangolins could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created deliberately or accidentally by humans.
The Crowns drew general attention to the recent explosion of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of the coronaviruses by flying mice and other animals has radically altered our perception of the importance of zonal origin and HCoV habitat in human transmission.
Convincible evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 occur from flying mice and have been transmitted to a person through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between humans and civilizations in markets, closing the markets and destroying the civilizations could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of betacoronaviruses, close-born SARS-CoV-2, Pangolins should be removed in order to prevent zoonosal transmission of infection from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is passed to the person through the pangolins and other mammals and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
The MERS-COV virus, on the other hand, had a long history of single-stranded camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as has been done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop periodic MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach must be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genetics can emerge from the outbreak of the disease.
In the world, there are a variety of zoonous coronaviruses.
In particular, there are extremely diverse coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonous potential.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonous coronaviruses, which will lead to new coronaviruses in the future, which are easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce the amount of too much contact between humans and animals, a culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned.
Following the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there is a need for a better preparedness and response plan.
Indeed, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of capturing new Territories arises.
Although many characteristics of bats are favourable to the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals.
Permanent epidemiological supervision of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the Coronaviruses and their natural carriers, which will be useful in preventing animal transmission and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoos is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonozo viruses.
The SARS-CoV-2 puzzle still lacks some fragments.
First, if flying mice were passed on to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances flying mice and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transfer, it is necessary to determine how humans have come into contact with bats.
Third, if the role of a true intermediate is to be played by the third mammals, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological supervision and experimental infection should be undertaken.
Whether it is a flying mouse, a pangolin or other mammals, it is expected that in the future, SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 among humans.
Diagnostic criteria should be updated for “hearing suspicion of illness” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief handbook on the diagnosis and treatment of the new Coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, the CROIvirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and present the latest diagnostic criteria for “hearing suspicion of illness” and “confirmed cases”, in accordance with the “Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), was launched and the virus disease itself was referred to as “hard acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection, SARS-CoV-2, our group developed a brief handbook and published it online on the website of the Military Medical Research Journal on 6 February 2020.
The publication received great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the Recommendation on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), have changed considerably the content of some of its provisions.
Recently, the work of Zhou (Zhou) with the co-sponsors contained comments on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on previous clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19 (test seventh version) and current studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of the document (3 March 2020), a single element of the epidemiological history, with two clinical manifestations of the disease, should be combined in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis in order to confirm the case of suspected illness:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or residences in and around Uhan, or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nuclear acid test); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Ohhan and its surrounding areas or from other locations where COVID-19 cases were reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (an 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded for 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartments, office, class, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external incidence of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cells are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocyte levels at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case should be based on the case of a disease suspected of having one of the following points of pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genine sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronaviruses; (3) the results of the certificate for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or a change in test results with a negative effect on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, or an increase in titra at least 4 times in the recovery phase with respect to the corresponding acute phase indicator.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (2 January 2020) issues of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory pathways or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issue, and then in the seventh issue the need for serologic evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and helps to incorporate positive results for specific antibodies into the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution when treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. must be updated, as it defines persons without clinical symptoms as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “acquiring suspicion of illness” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, a daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths per day from virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home, had been reported to have been infected.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, told us that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of those who died were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer reported to the local news agency Anadolu that Jalal Sayfur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was treated at the Meitri Kuwaiti Clinic.
On Saturday, the Minister for Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obijdul Quader, stated that public transport would be terminated for longer periods than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was suspended on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods — medicine, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March to two persons who returned from Italy, as well as to one of them ' s wives.
As of 19 March, these three people had already been cured.
SARS-CoV-2 crossed a million-fold infection rate around the world
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronary infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 Coronary.
On the same day, the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and Zambia recorded the first case of death from the Cronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which there had been no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 to Central European time (8800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were deaths.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that there were over 1,000 deaths caused by Coronavirus infection on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobianin, extended the regime for the self-isolation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would receive wages until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote in opposition.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while earlier curfews only lasted from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m..
Thailand planned a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m..
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home-based isolation regime was extended by order until 1 May.
In Australia, toilet paper packages are limited to one-on-one purchases
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles store networks reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased at one time in all the country's shops to two and one, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-pack restriction.
These restrictions have been reported in cass announcements as well as on the Facebook network page.
Citizens were reportedly beginning to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the quantity of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles trade network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of a restriction on four packages, “the toilet paper in many stores is still crumbling too fast — one delivery for an hour” — and called such a demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI, on a Facebook post on Tuesday, described this trend as “a surprise”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, last week there was a sharp increase in sales.
The Costco magasin in Canberra last week also limited this quantity to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles began to order larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for special environmental early sales.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Retailers, reported that he was trying to replenish stocks, but this was hampered by the restrictions of the local authorities on the travel schedule for trucks.
It looks forward to increasing the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less lucrative offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the depletion of stocks, some stores could not carry out environmental shares.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores were filling up stock every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the quantities of warehouses were small and after the sale of the total volume, long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if regiments could be filled and products such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not be panicked,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the last environment, the manufacturer of the revised toilet paper Who Guives a Crap reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brand products, reported that they work 24 hours a day to provide sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a property sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the lack of customers on a week's day's holiday, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to first auction participants.
The third edition of the daily NT News publication in Darwin included an eight-page tab for cutting and using toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, shops first were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they did not intend to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, disincentives for hands, gallantery, hand washing, and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online van of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of the Andres toilet paper to 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
While the term “pandemia” only describes the extent of the disease rather than the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that the Governments of countries need to take measures:
“All countries, together, are still in a position to influence the progress of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease and mobilize their citizens,” explained the WHO Director General, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreiss.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet to be monitored from its inception to continued global proliferation”.
Mr. Hebraius expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the Coronavirus.
We have also never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of the disease as an international emergency of public health and then granted it a new status, the pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauchy, said of the outbreak: “It's only a start, it's going to be worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases were reported on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 is the present-day Coronary Disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Cornavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and an emergency of international public health significance was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing some 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people were cured.
China ' s mortality rate is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory dysdrome.
The initial symptoms to the peak are usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment is currently found.
The basic treatment is symptomatic and supporting, and the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough covering, human distance, identification and self-insulation of people suspected of being infected.
Worldwide, authorities have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, job risk control and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a widespread shortage of goods compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
The Internet has begun to disinformation about the virus, and there have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of spread of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Uhan (the capital of Hubei province), China, reported instances of pneumonia with unknown cause and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.
Infections were mainly associated with the Juannian wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have a zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus with a large similarity to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronaviruses of the pangolin and the SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the virus did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases registered in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a publication of the South China office of the Journal of Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had declined but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded new infections in China itself.
The number of cases can be significantly understated, particularly because of the many cases with low symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of youth infection were reported, with patients 19 years of age and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and Patrick Wallans, the United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the formation of effective group immunity among the population.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who were tested on COVID-19 and whose test proved to be positive according to official records.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimates for the baseline reproductive number of the infection (R0) for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-equipped.
In other more complex cases, the onset of symptoms to the point of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent of which was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were committed by persons over the age of 60, while 75 per cent of those killed were related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results from COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since official figures may ignore dead people who have not been tested — for example, if they die at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID by 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesperson of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than actual.” His words are supported by reports of some common cases in the United States. Such data are often attributed to pandemics such as the H1N1 flu epidemic, which was first confirmed in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was registered on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia on 14 February in France.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary from region to region and time of disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the time taken to start the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, gender and general health status. The mortality/infection ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during the given interval.
According to the Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality ratio declined from 17.3% (for those with symptoms of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from the disease, and the percentage of deaths from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection until the disease is complete.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Centre of Evidence Medicine, the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the first arbitrary test results on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and can vary depending on the location.
Matsei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau and then, when the number of accessible carriers ends, they begin to fade.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when that will occur.”
The Chinese Government’s Senior Medical Adviser, Jun Nanshan, argues that “everything can be finished by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO’s recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate within perhaps a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established”, physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of Vanderbilt University, believes, “I don’t think that the coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easy to transmit” and that he“can become a seasonal illness every year”.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, dizziness (slip), loss of acne, swelling, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headaches, burns, rhesus, blood, diarrhea or cyanosis, and WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems of about 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as respiratory problems, persistent pain or chest tumour, sudden sense of confusion, difficulty in awakening and sleeping a person or lips, and should seek medical attention without delay. The further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory dysdrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
While some infected people may suffer from an unsymptomatic disease without any clinical symptoms, the results of the tests confirm the fact of the infection, and doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients diagnosed with diagnosis be placed under strict control and examined for the purpose of infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of non-symptomatic cases varies from a few units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and symptom incidence) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; it is not yet clear as to the symptoms of the loss of adoration: the initial estimate of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details about how the disease spread is still unknown.
The disease is generally thought to be transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops that come into the air with a cough, a sneer or a conversation; close contact involves contact with a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the drops can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) in the open cough.
There is a presumption that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during conversation, which may remain in the air for longer periods of time; respiratory drops may also occur during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not normally carried over the air.
The drops can reach the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation (SLRs), may result in the spraying of exhalation products and hence the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also enter the body if the person is related to the contaminated surface, including the skin, and subsequently touching his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been successful in testing three days before symptoms occur, and this suggests that the transmission of the virus may be preceded by an express diagnosis of the symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of non-symptomatic disease, but contact monitoring studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from non-symptomatic carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) state that it is not yet clear how easy the virus is to spread, but it is clear that one patient usually infects two to three other people. The virus can survive several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus was capable of living up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
The data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, and a positive result has been obtained for domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they would after contacting other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
The severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered with three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory problems registered in Uhana.
All signs of a new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature with related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by domestic soap that dissolves its protective lining.
It is believed to have a zoonous origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mice.
At the whole-genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of the coronavirus by a batCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome of the Pangolin and human viruses.
A whole-genome comparison to date has shown that the largest proportion of similarity (92 per cent) exists between the coronavirus of the pangolin and the SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed by symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by a polymerase circuit response with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or by computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhana showed that CT is far more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, as many of its visualisation functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols at SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Testing is carried out for the real-time polymerase circuit response (RT-PPD).
It can be performed on respiratory tests and blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of between a few hours and several days.
The test is usually used to carry out a test, although a zest may also be used, and several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal use.
In the United States, the Cellex serologic test was approved for use only by certified laboratories on an emergency basis.
The characteristics of X-ray and X-ray tomography (CT) symptom visualization include asymmetric peripheral mutations such as matte glass and no pleural exposure.
The Italian Radiological Society provides an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as an adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, there is limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was conducted comparing the results of the breast-cell CT and testing of PCR, and it was found that although images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered faster; they are also more sensitive, and thus can be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
X-ray and computer scant neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or salphing to be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may have already become infected should wear a mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated, many Governments recommend that they refrain from any emergency visits to the countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to a population whose members do not know where and how they were infected; medical personnel who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions as well as precautions when dealing with other people and eye protection; monitoring contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty) as well as over 100 other organizations have made statements requiring that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on developing solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as the registration of user proximity to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test is positive, he is given a notice. There are also groundless versions of how to prevent an infection — for example, the covering of the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with severe hand pollution, and before eating, after slurring, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap that exposes its protective lining.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on alcohol with at least 60 per cent alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be decompressed by a number of solutions (a non-state steel disinfected substance starts a minute after being injected) containing 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent podium.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chlorohexidine, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if suspected or confirmed at a COVID facility such as an office or a daytime station, all premises of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and bankers used by sick people, should be disinfections.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose of the back of the elbow or of the salfette be covered with cough or sneezing and immediately release the used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use a medical mask, since the use of the mask may limit the range and range of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air in conversation, silence and cough.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their face, while touching their hands with dirty hands is the main means of infection.” Masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for those who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, for example, those who look after a person from COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of touches.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of health masks in public places.
CDC centres, U.S.A., recommend wearing woven face masks for non-medical purposes, and China has separately stressed the importance of using one-time health masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 foot) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Thailand’s health officials call on people to make facial fabric masks in the home and clean them every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has obliged all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, 10 million masks per day were issued in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced from mid-March, and medical masks were ordered for all passengers in trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask by going outside; those who could not acquire masks were encouraged to sew them on their own in the home environment.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures to stay at home, restricting travel by avoiding human places by using contactless greetings and physically away from others.
Many Governments in the regions, particularly those affected by outbreaks, now prescribe or recommend social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50 and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two persons in groups comprising older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system, and had a serious risk of contracting the virus. CDC recommended that they stay at home as long as possible if the region had an outbreak of disease. WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” in late March 2020, thus clarifying the goal of this measure of reducing physical contact within social relationships, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be completely excluded from contact with other people, rather than remain in contact with other people in alternative ways, some departments have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that you have only sex with your permanent partners with whom you live, and to whom you are confident that he has no virus or symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected recommended self-insulation in domestic settings.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions on appropriate self-insulation, and many Governments have also made mandatory or have recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be placed in quarantine on their own.
The strictest quarantine was prescribed for persons in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected persons, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include controlling the spread of the disease, suppressing it or mitigating it.
Control of the spread of the disease is carried out at early stages to monitor and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts are directed towards mitigating the impact of measures aimed at slowing the spread and mitigating the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the effects of the disease can be implemented simultaneously.
Reducing the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of cases to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as levelling the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacist interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as school closures and the abolition of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures, such as surface clean-up; after the gravity of the outbreak became apparent in China, more decisive action was taken to contain outbreaks such as urban isolation and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, and a system has been set up to alert the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who were self-insulated and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fined surplus medical supplies was increased, and modelling in the United Kingdom and the United States showed that there were serious challenges in terms of mitigation (reduction, but not a halt to the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (resurrection of the epidemic).
An optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the disease can reduce the peak burden on health systems by 2/3, while mortality doubles, but can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
The pressure may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-viral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking prescription drugs from colds, drinking sufficient fluid and rest can help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, internal fluid intake and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic means” could alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and the adaptation of health care to the needs of patients from COVID-19 as a major response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing on COVID-19, the abolition of emergency procedures where possible, the identification of virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis COVID-19, as well as the enhancement of intensive treatment capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of accessible IWL and pharmac devices.
There are different theories as to where the very first case of infection, the so-called “zero patient”, could have arisen.
On 1 December 2019, the first known case of infection of the new Coronavirus infection likely occurred in Uhan province of Hubei, China.
During the month, the number of cases of contamination by the Coronavirus in Hubei Province has gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the Juannian Seafood market, where animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus was of a zoonosy origin. On 26 December, the Hubei province clinic recorded a case of a large-scale pneumonia disease of unknown origin, with which a physician, Zhang Tianzin, reported on 27 December, at the Jianghian Disease Control and Prevention Centre in the city of Uhan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central clinic in Uhan city warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police about their responsibility for spreading false rumours, and Ai Fen, the doctor, got a plea from his superiors for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhana Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the Uhanian health authorities reported an estimated number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate investigations in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year's Festivals and the fact that Uhanh is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, there were 6,174 symptoms of the disease; as at 26 March, the United States had chased China and Italy with the greatest number of confirmed cases of worldwide infection; by 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had been cured.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many of the countries of the Schengen zone in Europe restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory house accommodation, compulsory house covering or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated by the Philippines, some 59 million people were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were isolated, and two days later the figure rose to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to another report whose information was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jisin worked with an unknown type of pneumonia disease, which was reported on 27 December by the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Uhan.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
With regard to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhan about the responsibility for “disclosure of rumours” of the outbreak.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “substantial evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinpin, as “the war of the people”.
The events of the “largest-scale quarantine in the history of humanity” were unfolded on 23 January, the health border was declared and the ban on entry into and from Uhan, which was later extended to a total of 15 towns in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal transportation was banned in the city.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital called Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other institutions in Uhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macao regions have implemented a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote working regimes.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei Province and beyond.
The schedule of public transport was changed and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, civilian traffic controls have been introduced and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (over half of the population) have experienced some form of open air traffic restrictions, after the outbreak of the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission had been reported in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister, Li Katian, reported that the prevalence of intra-transmission diseases had mostly been stopped and the outbreak in China was controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei other than Uhana were lifted, two months after the closure of the province of quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of a visa or residence permit would be suspended since 28 March; no exact deadlines had been given for the lifting of the order.
Those wishing to come to China will be required to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with cash incentive packages. On 4 April, at 10:00, a national three-minute “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the Coronavirus announced by the State Council and coincided with the Queenmin holiday, but the central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, respecting physical distance to avoid a resurgence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 extended into South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported that there had been a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Jesus Shinchongji Church.
Shinchongji's followers arrived in Tega from Uhanya, which is believed to be a source of outbreak.
As at 22 February, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms. South Korea had the highest alert reported on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and by 29 February this figure had increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were put in quarantine after testing three soldiers had confirmed the existence of a virus.
The outbreak had an impact on the number of journeys, so that the airline flight schedule had been changed. South Korea had launched a population screening programme on the existence of a virus, on the monitoring of contacts and on the organization of quarantine measures for persons in contact, which was considered to be the largest and the best in terms of organization worldwide.
The screening methods have included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile app to all those who have come from abroad, basic virus testing, the results of which have been ready for the next day, as well as increasing testing capabilities that have allowed up to 20,000 people to test daily.
South Korea ' s programme was considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities had not been isolated, and South Korean society had initially been divided by President Mun Jae Ina ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impeachment for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total number of cases of infection in one day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as from 1 April, all newcomers from abroad would be placed in quarantine for two weeks.

On 19 February, Iran reported on the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures taken by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government was not planning to subject entire areas affected by the outbreak to quarantine, but that only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, but the urban movement in front of the Persian New Year continued.
The Shi'ite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their disease to Iran, indicating that the outbreak could be more serious than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have positive virus testing results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison leadership to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to release temporarily all prisoners suitable for that category.
The Organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By 23 March, there were 50 new cases of Cronavirus every hour in Iran, and one new death from the Cronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than reported at the official level.
It is also anticipated that the U.S. sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded that economic sanctions be eased against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease hit Italy, when two Chinese tourists had tests for SARS-CoV-2 from Rome, had a positive effect.
The number of infections has increased rapidly, causing the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 infections was subsequently discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombard on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “To enter and exit the outbreak zone will be overruled.
These areas have already been ordered to suspend businesses and cancel sports activities.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy at the time.
All major sporting events, including the A-series football games, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.

On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military fixed-wing aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases in Italy, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to this high mortality rate in Italy — a large number of older persons in the country and the lack of opportunities to examine all those who are still behind the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus most calmly from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts, which were not of paramount importance, should be avoided, offering people to work from home as much as possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stronger measures for social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and active leisure in fresh air only by cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, by imposing fines and by disaggregating people.

Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the actual incidence of the disease was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence until the end of February of the Federal Government ' s authorization to use non-State test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive pre-March criteria that would enable citizens to undergo testing (this could be done only by appointing a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by 13 March less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even in the presence of symptoms and the appointment of a doctor, were waiting for their turn for hours or days.” After a first case of death from the Cronavirus in the United States was reported from Washington State on 29 February, Governor Jay Insley announced a state of emergency, which was also announced shortly thereafter by other states.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to combat the epidemic and control the spread of infection.
WHO noted the obvious differences between the incident of atypical pneumonia that occurred in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of secreting information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the disease on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regularly updated the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Uhana, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that, while “this measure was clearly recommended not by WHO”, it was also “a very important confirmation of the fulfilment of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the highest point of spread” and referred to it as “the unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO announced an international emergency in the public health system (PHEIC), the situation became sixth since 2009 when it was first applied during the pig flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the proclamation of PHEIC was attributable to “risk global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, he said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend a limitation on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested $675 million from the world community to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “have no systems to detect people infected by the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for our weakest epidemic”, and called upon the international community to “make a choice: to invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, as stated by WHO, will “recent to health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak of the disease in a broader social and economic way”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc group to ensure the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to help resolve the situation within the country and assess “serious disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “peace should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call it a pandemic disease, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the global proliferation of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a test of every government on the planet that is ready for a reality: the time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country and you need to be ready, and it stressed that a proper response could help the world to avoid the “greatest scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for the announcement of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing that every human being on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced a pandemic coronavirus.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about both the prevalence and severity of the disease and at an equally alarming level of inactivity in this regard”. WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the pandemic, including later declaration of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanama, Director-General of WHO, was invited to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to take measures to save lives and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide insights and recommendations.
The digital hub contains information on national policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gov and Eduardo Bolsonor, son of Jair Bolsonor, President of Brazil, for his actions in the fight against the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the provinces were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed that they were not satisfied with the political pressure to break out in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of China's Communist Party, Si Jinpin, from public anger over the Cronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the COVID-19 started in Uhana but took sides in the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Uhana virus”, claiming that “the censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and “distracts the inability of the U.S. President to control the spread of disease”.
The Daily Coast had access to the U.S. government telegram, which contained a communications strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with these references to the strategy: “All business in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China 's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a “promotional pressure” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitan component that includes power struggles through a pick-up and so-called generous policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with assistance to the last two countries, according to some information.
Jack Ma's 100,000 medical masks to Cuba fell under a ban on the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
Disputes have also arisen with regard to medical masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IWL machines to Spain.
Early in March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the Crowned Italy.
Maurcio Massari, the Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China alone has responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not demonstrate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch of Russian military ambulances, specialized disintegrating transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, arguing that 80% of Russian aid was “free or little useful to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to have a favourable effect on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardia Attlio Fontana and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo of Italy rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Spokesman Kreml Dmitri Peskov stated that “in proposing assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] implies that when American producers of medical equipment and materials grow in production, they will also be able to respond as needed”.
NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized Defender 2020 (Protector-2020): “In today’s public health crisis, the conduct of these exercises jeopardizes the lives of not only the United States military and many European participating countries but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Iranian Government has suffered a great deal from the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament and fifteen other current or former political figures being identified.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruani of Iran, in an open letter, asked world leaders for assistance, reporting that his country was having difficulty combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States, and that the epidemic had given rise to calls on the United States to adopt social policies spread in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified system of health care and care for children, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan ' s “unmarked and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was initially divided by the response of President Mun Zhe-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impeachment for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease, and the pandemic had forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to rule by decree, suspend Parliament, and hold elections and punish those charged with spreading feicous information about the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of epidemic equipment, the purchase of goods in panic and disruption of manufacturing and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Control Authority issued warnings of lack of medicine and medical equipment, resulting from increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
There have also been panic purchases in several locations; this has resulted in the loss of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn has resulted in a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protection has increased by 100 times.
This jump resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared with the average price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies by four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection facilities around the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will therefore be affected.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity resulted in a lack of child nutrition in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stock accumulation and illicit trade in critically important products, which have been successful, have helped avoid the severe food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices can rise.
Half the food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies in order to provide adequate food for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
China was hit by the loss of the world economy: according to data from the media of 16 March, China ' s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020, as a result of measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, resulting in a 20.5 per cent drop in retail sales.
Material China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, the outbreak of the virus is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demaray, a staff member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, is projected to remain vocal in the markets until a clearer understanding of the potential results can be obtained.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could exceed that of the Atypical Pneumonia epidemic of 2002-2004.
According to an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and negative effects could last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take “term action” after a sharp decline in oil prices owing to the falling demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, owing to growing concerns about the Cronavirus outbreak, various United States stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow-Jones index for industrial companies, showed the most sharp drop since 2008, with Dou falling to 1,191 points, the largest day-to-day decline since the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a drop of more than 10 per cent.
On 28 February, the Chop Savings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again due to concerns over the spread of the Coronavirus, and the biggest drop occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian expressed appreciation for the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the prohibitions on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp reduction in the demand for aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British Regional Flybe have ceased to exist.
A negative impact on the cruise industry has been greater than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
The national and regional governments have abolished a number of events involving large numbers of people, including the annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also self-closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year's events were abolished and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large crowds; for example, the Western City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the holiday until 10 February, ordering most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised their response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared the emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the New Year ' s celebration. The retail sector has suffered worldwide: the store hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visit to retail points in Europe and Latin America has been reduced by 40 per cent.
The retail industry in North America and the Middle East has reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, commercial centres ' attendance fell by 33 - 43 per cent in March compared to February.
The operators of trading centres around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing facilities to test visitors ' temperatures and canceling activities, and according to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people behind the poverty line than it would have been in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the outbreak of the Uhana epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were housed in their own provinces or locked up in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for help.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of the Coronavirus could take 47 million jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, with tens of millions of Indian migrant workers receiving a daily wage, and a study by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that 44% of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another, and nearly 900,000 Spanish workers had lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and nearly half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidized reduced working schedule, part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The fields of art and cultural heritage were also severely affected by a pandemic that affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often publicly-funded) mission to ensure access to the cultural heritage of society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public and, where possible, by supporting the arts.
By March 2020 museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely, or access to them had been restricted in various ways, while exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; another recent and emerging consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has also announced the abolition of events in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services begin broadcasting on radio, live air, or television, while some church leaders offer open - air services.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed down its churches, clocks, and St. Peter’s Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and bandwarts.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the Cronavirus outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has brought about the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events have been cancelled or moved, including the League of UEFA Champions 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-200, Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA season 2019-20 and the NHL season 2019-20.
The Coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Olympic Summer Games, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted beyond 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which were normally broadcast live, were also either moved or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online, and many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional off-line events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this has helped creative people to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There are many Internet sites on the Coronavirus theme, many of which are humorous and smooth out disturbing moods that are characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as in the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fears, suspicions and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February News (where most of the contamination was still confined to China) recorded racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received fair retaliation for anything.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many residents of Uhana and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, have been supported in both online and online settings.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the effects of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early petition in order to prevent Chinese nationals from entering their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#China's Do Not Come Japan) took leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report an increasing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the Coronavir “Chinese virus”, which critics view as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses that carried Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhana to New Sanjara.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major Indian cities reported cases of persecution related to the Cronavirus outbreak.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharata Gianata Party of West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “God took vengeance on them. ”
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them “disgusting”. In China, xenophobia and racism rekindled against non-citizens of China in the pandemic: foreigners began to call them “foreign garbage” and “utilization sites”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the Coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers made open their scientific articles on the Cronavirus outbreak.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to their research on pre-print publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the respiratory cortex 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PC, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only to detect the RNA-binding virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antitel detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostics and popular control.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have undergone a disease, including those who have been too small to treat them in hospital or not at all.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the outcome of the test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly controversial.
These differences are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
The polymerase chain response of the real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) can be used to test from respiratory pathways obtained in various ways, including a nail from a noxule or a wet sample.
Results are usually available within a period of between a few hours and two days.
The OT-PPR test, which was carried out on the strokes taken from the throat, was only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, still profusing in the lungs.
For infected patients tested for the second week, lower respiratory tract material may be taken as an alternative, with the help of the esophagus, or products may be used.
An early PCR test was developed at the Sharita Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time polymerase circuit response (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech had developed a package to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects a gene called \"E\", which is common to all beta-coronaviruses, and RdRp, which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese BGI Group became one of the first companies authorized by the China National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit as an emergency based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute through the organization of the International Response Resource its diagnostic panel for conducting RT-PCs in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of test kits produced incomplete results due to married reagents and a narrow area of testing conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervisory Office as part of an emergency application permit, and U.S. commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 based on RT-PPD across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing COVID-19 all over the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the withdrawal and processing of the analyses must be performed in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Center for Research and Research in Virus and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours of high sample coverage, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued such a permit for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses the process of amplification of isothermal nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, it can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and Taiwan is developing a monoclonal antibody test that specifically connects to the nucleocapsid protein (N-white) of the new coronavirus, and hopes to be able to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, like the flu express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “rentgenograms of the breast cell have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computer imaging] may have such value even before symptoms appear”.
Typical signs identified during CT include bilateral multi-long sub-pleural focussing on the kind of \"math glass\" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptoms of the bubbly bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualisation functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation to “do not use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends that the same method be used for initial screening of CDCs.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control, tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnostics (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.
CLT typically uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can also be used to track an immune response.
With POCT, one sample of blood is usually produced by procrastinating each blood.
In contrast to the methods of PCR, the blood collection phase is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their anti-body tests.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were given European permits to use their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of viral RNA.
In early April, England found that none of the kits it had acquired for testing on antibodies had been satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: “The emergency ward passes a sample test,” the patient spits into it, gives back and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot suspect-testing scheme in the home environment, which eliminates the risk of infection by patients of other patients of the clinic, or the need to disinflect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. In the course of expression testing on COVID-19, when there are suspicious cases, the medical officer takes the test using all appropriate precautions.
The Express Centers helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Physicians stated that it was ready to carry out about 12,000 tests a day on outpatient conditions, and that one week earlier, they were able to do only 10,700 tests a week.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the expenses shall be covered by health insurance.
According to the President of Robert Koha Institute, the overall test performance of Germany is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed that a number of major cities should be depressed.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was not known because only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study found that, as of the calendar week, 12/2020 SARS-CoV-2 had a total of at least 483,295 analyses, up to the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) had been positive. The researchers at the Israeli Clinics, Technion and Rambam Hospital, had developed and tested a method of simultaneously testing samples of 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if a combined sample showed a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary 2000-quam laboratory for the detection of emergencies called Huo-Yang (in Chinese) or Fire Glass, which could process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jianim and completed in only 5 days; the simulation revealed that had it not been operational at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and therefore quarantine costs would have been twice as high.
At the opening of the laboratory in Uhana, laboratories of Huo-Yang were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total of 50,000 tests per day were produced, and the Origami Assays open multiple samples were released, which could test up to 1,122 patient tests per COVID19 using only 93 test samples, and such balanced designs could work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, because of the lack of and lack of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States was problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to test sample protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of testing for the Cronavirus currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates exceeds that of any other country, and a large proportion of the population will be protested shortly.
This was due to the possibilities for rapid testing, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PC tests a day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the gene profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the United States epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, leading to a lack of test kits in the United States. At the outset, outbreaks in China and the United States had caused problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide a sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the strengthening of testing programmes as a better way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analyses, were overburdened and stocks of lubricants and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American CDC test kits had “failures” and for this reason the Government eliminated bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private development of the tests, but Spain had acquired test kits from China's Shenzhen Bioaesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the use of these sets was inaccurate.
The firm explained that failure to collect samples or misuse the sets could cause the results to be inaccurate.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the results and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. Eighty per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed that they be dropped in the Danube: Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had “high levels of errors” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Britain had purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but had announced that they were not suitable for use in early April 2020.
The quarantine measures for those whose analyses produced positive results on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring the people with whom the patients were contacted, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy, a COVID-19 died, conducted two testing sessions for a population of about 3,400, with intervals of about ten days.
About half of the people with no positive results had symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed in quarantine.
The entry into the area was closed, and the measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive surveillance of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less stress than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closing of restaurants and shops did not have to be imposed.
Many of the activities were cancelled, and on 28 March, Singapore urged the residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March were opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but their limitations are less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted than in deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with poorly expressed symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO monitoring laboratories for validation testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The next schedule of the “good results” column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher success rate than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of hand cleaning up pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hand soap in certain “critical situations” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal or oral means.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, when he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous linings) with his hands unwashed.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after the baby or diapers have been washed, before feeding the baby, before eating, before and after cooking, or after handling raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with the help of the ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after the care of the sick person.
After changing diapers or blowing the baby in the toilet.
After shivering, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, food or waste of animal origin.
Hand hygiene is a health-related activity.
The washing of hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other communicable diseases, prevents communicable diarrhea, reduces respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality rates for households.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing could result in a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits such as hand washing with soap.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of hand washing benefits can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea can be linked to hand washing with soap, hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ORS), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which brings about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after eating can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce the mortality rate from diarrhea by almost half and the mortality rate from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can dry the skin and, subsequently, damage it.
A Danish study in 2012 found that excessive hand washing could lead to a skin swelling and shivering, a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis that is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of acsession-compulsive disorder (RCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal and oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (weeding, defecation), once the baby’s berries (growing), are washed before feeding the baby, before feeding them, before feeding them, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where the hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after a cut or wound has been treated, after a sneeze, coughing or shivering, after being touched with animal waste or animal waste, after being touched with garbage.
In many countries the washing process with soap is quite common.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 revealed that an average of 38.7 per cent of soap-washing families was a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest 97 per cent was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was in China at 23 per cent; there are now several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing in school-schoolers is one such methodology that helps to teach children to do so.
The urgent health care programme of the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of extensive efforts to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on bi-annual de-worming, daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of fluorine teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from each cover is more effective if soap or cleaning is added during washing.
The main effect of soap and cleaning is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective medium for cleaning the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient quantity of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may be exposed to it in previous use.
A small number of studies on exposure to each cover of solid - soap contaminated bacteria indicate that there is little likelihood of such exposure as bacteria snug with foam.
The CDC still states that “liquid hand-to-hand meter soap is the preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health - care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfection means has an selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
Antibacterial soap, however, contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclose, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective with respect to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be in line with the advertised one.
In addition to surface-active and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (ucous, ascorbine, breast) as a regulator of pH, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other rest products (lae faith, vitamines, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School showed that in the prevention and removal of hand-in-hand bacteria, simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
The hot water, a human-friendly temperature, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats, pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial pressure on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a means of hand hygiene that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st centuries, tools for hand-to-hand hygiene with no water (also known as disinfections for hands on alcohol, antiseptics for disinfection of hands or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these substances are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisture, such as glycerin in liquid or foam, which makes it easy to use these tools and reduces the effects of skin drying by alcohol.
The addition of the diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the anti-microbial activity: disinfectants with a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Deinfections on a alcohol basis kill bacteria, including multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinvirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfections containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a 3.5 reduction logarithm) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent on the hands 1 minute after use.The disinfections for the hands are most effective against bacteria and are less effective against certain viruses.
Disinfections are, on a alcohol basis, almost ineffective against Norwalk (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most frequent cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol must be used to carefully process and water the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back face of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers, are cleared for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam, or gel is fully absorbed.
The ends of both hands should also be carefully washed, and the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends choosing for hand washing rather than for the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increasing popularity of these disinfectants is due to ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfections for hands on alcohol can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and (or) skin dampers.
The effects of drying with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigation substances to the equipment.
In clinical trials, disinfections for hands on alcohol containing mitigating components caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial cleaning agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact drop syndrome or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
A lower probability of irritable contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, non-water resources do not clean the hands of organic substances but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfections for the hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soaps and water, since pathogenic microorganisms are still at hand when using them.
The efficiency of the disinfection for hands without alcohol depends to a large extent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
It has recently been shown that drugs using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side-by-side responses.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with green or clay.
Gold or clay may be more efficient than just water, but they will always be less efficient than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or zola are contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, zola is a disinfecting agent, since when it is in contact with water, it forms a sticky solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using zoo or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent infection, U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend hand washing techniques that include the following steps:
Loosen your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is the running water that is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated and the temperature of the water is not significant.
Wash your hands with lots of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap (not just one water).
Hold hands for at least 20 seconds.
Exercise helps remove germs from the skin and the longer you rub your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Tie your hands thoroughly under the running water.
Retaliation of the hands in standing water can trigger a retaliatory infection.
Wash your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry alone.
The most common areas are the thumb, the wrist, the area between the fingers and under the finger.
The artificial toenails and the cracking toenails can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be used to prevent the drying of hands, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a canister or bottle stick with holes made and (or) using a zola, if necessary, such as in developing countries; there are water-saving solutions in places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) such as foot pedal taps and other low-cost options.
A knife pedal tap is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a knife lever that should be pressed to carry water on its hands and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand dryers are an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are ongoing over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing amount of research has shown that paper towels are far more occupational than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Paper Slamfettes and Coats, was the subject of this study to compare paper towels, hand dryers for warm air and more modern hand-flowing air dryers.
After washing and drying the hands in a warm air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria on toe cushions would increase by 194 per cent on average and 254 per cent on the palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying the hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the stick cushions increases by 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the handshake.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the stick cushions on average drops to 76 per cent, and on the palms to 77 per cent, scientists also tested to determine the possibility of cross-infection of multiple visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments at each kind of dry place.
A wind-and-air dryer that releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h) is capable of destroying microorganisms from the hands and own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and locker within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of dryers for warm - aired hands spreads microorganisms to a radius of up to 12 feet [0.25 m] from the dryer.
In 2005, TüV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various hand-dry methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed, depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers and hand dryers are compared to the dryers with paper towels.
Cleaning your hands using disinfecting napkins can be an alternative option during trips in the absence of soap and water.
The disincentive for hands on alcohol shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after a Hungarian physician named Ignatz Zemmelweis found it to be effective (in 1846) in preventing inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital officials of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce infection rates.
The medical washing of hands takes at least 15 seconds, using a large quantity of soap, water, or gel to wash and contrast each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubed against each other, with your fingers crossed.
If you have dirt under your nails, you can use a stick to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after the drying of the hands, by closing the tap, and by closing and opening any doors if necessary.
This avoids repeated contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms (microbials) and prevent their proliferation.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related bleeding infections by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization published a leaflet depicting standard washing and hand handling procedures to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO Manual on Handicapped Hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The review was carried out by Whitby in co-sponsorship.
If compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization defines “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptic as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in a high content environment that is resistant to antibiotics. A tap is needed to “clean up” the hands before surgery, which can be turned on and off without touching the hands; a little bit of chlorohexid or iodine water should also be used for hand-burning, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing, sterile brush for friction, and another sterile finger-cleaning tool.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires hand washing and rinsing to the elbow usually for a period of 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to lose hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During clawing, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the handbones.
After washing, the hands dry the sterile cloth and wear a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
In order to combat staphylocococcal infections, it was found in hospitals that the first 20 per cent of washing was done with the greatest benefit, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the washing of antibacterial soaps, hand washing by conventional soap results in more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A hands-to-hand comparison with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the handling of hands by alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 percent compared with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more efficient than hand alcohol in terms of reducing the number of influenza virus A H1N1 and spore Clostridium difficille, which may include training of hand washing personnel, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing solutions to the hands, and the staff's written and oral reminders of the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap, or hand washing in homes, schools, and the workplace makes it difficult to keep your hands clean regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, taps for hand washing are not available in every private or public toilet, although there are also cheap ways to arrange hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene may also be due to entrenched habits, not lack of soap or water.
Promotion and promotion of hand washing with soap can have an impact on policy decisions, raise awareness of hand washing benefits and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are required to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve hand-to-hand hygiene in countries with lower average incomes, community health and epidemiological surveillance are effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach: it promotes the implementation in schools of simple economic measures that encourage washing of hands by students using soap as well as other hygiene requirements.
With minimum standards, schools can improve from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-held personnel is one of the possible measures of the hands-on health awareness campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
World Day of Handwashing (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the Cronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, the United Nations Children ' s Fund promotes hand washing.
Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with the indicator of DALYs (delivery years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable groups of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovations in hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by the rotten smells called miazms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of diseases through the digestive tract and health-related infections, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand-to-hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of the pig flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “right hand washing techniques” were placed in public toilets, as well as in office building and airport toilets.
The phrase “crushing hands” means showing a reluctance to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It is from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in making a decision about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, which was followed by a wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth play, Lady Macbeth goes on to let her hands go unwittingly in an attempt to cleanse herself of the seeming stain of an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and caused her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have remembered or observed an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and hands-on personnel are more important.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they see will participate in any other “cleaning” of compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In the religions, hand washing has both a hygiene and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands by water, but without soap, is part of the ritual in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing after a toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, hand washing is considered necessary before and after every meal.
Monitoring of production factors related to COVID-19
Productive monitoring of COVID-19 involves the use of safety and health techniques to control risk and control the COVID-19 (COVID-19) in 2019.
Proper workplace risk control depends on the location and work objective, based on risk assessment, community severity of the epidemic and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, which require basic measures to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home on the grounds of illness, respect for respiratory labeling, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with persons who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected due to the current prevalence of illness in society or during international travel.
Such categories may include public relations, e.g. in schools, high population environments and in some major retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, include airing with high-impact air filters, the use of shields and available personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue staff who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are of high risk category, with the risk increasing to a very high level in the procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or in the collection/treatment of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion at COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate for such personnel include the use of safety equipment such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal safety equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have different effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible contamination.
Commercial templates may change both in terms of the types of goods to which there is demand and the means of acquiring such goods (e.g., making non-penetrating purchases or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there are possible disruptions to the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to provide protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
Plans also set out the monitoring tools necessary to address such risks, as well as plans for emergency interventions, for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may follow the recommendations of the national level or state level.
Some of the goals of response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among personnel, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such funds according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective engineering safety equipment is, then, administrative measures and finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering and security means isolating staff from workplace risk and does not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures change working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protection funds (PPE) are considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some of the risks.
All types of personal protection must be chosen depending on the risk to the employee, treated in size (e.g., repeaters), used in a continuous and proper manner, checked regularly, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk are of minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respect for respiratory labeling, including hand-closing with coughing and sneezing, provision of salfettes and containers for refuse, preparation for remote or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff members with symptoms of acute respiratory problems stay at home until the heat has stopped, the absence of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-reducing drugs or other medications that eliminate symptoms, and that policy makers be allowed to be flexible by letter, allowed staff members to stay at home to care for sick family members, and made them aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, mid-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) to persons with no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 in connection with the spread of illness in society in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with a recent visit by the person to the distribution point of COVID-19.
These categories include workers who have been in contact with the public, e.g. schools, the working environment with high population density and some major retailers. These groups and groups with higher risks include the installation of high-risk air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for non-road-free mobile services. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings for virtual means, replacement schedules, termination of non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, development of communications plans in emergency situations, including a forum to respond to harassment issues, provision of relevant training to workers on the risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, training for workers to use protective clothing and equipment, proper use of such tools and the working environment, facilitating access to other workers, ensuring that they have access to regular health protection of their workers, and keeping their hands on the right handiwork.
In rare cases, it may be necessary for employees from such a risk group to carry repeaters.
If a person gets sick on the plane, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from another person to a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a member of a crew to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask, or the request to cover his nose and mouth with a salfette in cough or sneez.
Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when exposed to physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves used and other one-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, the safety measures include deferral of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and immediate reporting of a medical centre on board a ship, where there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination must be carried out in an isolated cabin, in the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of illness in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium level of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, for example, the cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or choral, cafés, longer port distances, the regulation of arrival and care times, the restriction of non-essential visits, and the use of separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a high rate of prevalence in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, measures for long-term school dropout may be considered; for law enforcement personnel performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as those issued by ambulance paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal remedies.
If close contact occurs during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their uniforms and re-use before using household clean aerosols or by contrast, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the use of personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and marine workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who contact patients with a confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol procedures or in the collection/treatment of persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include probes, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys, or the collection of invasive samples.
High-risk seafarers include staff working on confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they are exposed, they are placed in a very high-risk category; additional safety equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion at COVID-19, including procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health-care facilities and morgues, the use of special negative-pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
Tests should be conducted in accordance with the precautionary requirements for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the allocation of incoming patients to separate waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal remedies, OSHA recommends the use of respirators by workers who interact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as by persons who carry out procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the United States, the approved NIOSH repeaters for a person with a N95 filter or a higher grade should be used as part of an integrated writing programme on respiratory protection, which specifies the requirements for individual fund-raising and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort to the staff member, and WHO does not recommend special care, since COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by the respirator than by physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for screening personnel at the patient reception point.
Persons collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or carriers without procedures accompanied by aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the person, a robe and gloves.
In the procedures followed by the formation of aerosol, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be used instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of personal protection facilities around the world, WHO recommends that the need for protection be minimized by using remote medical facilities, physical barriers such as transparent windows, access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only to those who provide direct care, the use of personal protection only for a specific purpose, the continued use of the same repository without taking care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the chain of personal protection and recommending that masks be avoided for those without symptoms.

TEM: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
REGARDING DATA/VERSION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DEVELOPMENT: CC0: No protected rights
We live in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interrelationship of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have observed a friendly and caring relationship between all of our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chat rooms — a remarkable confirmation that, fortunately, we are having amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was commended for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to address Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
This is possible because of your work, whether on site functionality, paying for our colleagues or protecting community security.
The world needs the information provided on Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever before.
In such a time, to achieve meaningful results for peace, it is important not only that we do what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together from the week ahead.
Adjustment of our working arrangements and schedules
As previously stated by Robin, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During our communications, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it be.
For all personnel, contractors and non-staff personnel:
We expect that it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week to work before subsequent orders are issued.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work properly for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to care for your family, to purchase food or to go to a doctor’s office, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not watching your work time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and unquestionable, but we're talking about it.
It is not necessary to have a hospital record or off-load: simply inform your supervisor and help the team to revise the calendar and schedule of work to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please report to Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and attention from management to your situation.)
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and employees at an hourly rate.
Each person will receive payment according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can produce remarkable results, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some of the work is considered substantial.
We must always support these activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (otherwise) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are embarking on a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift our focus to support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
Delay today does not mean negative effects in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to make up for the lost” after the pandemic has ended.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timetables where possible.
What happens to APP?
In order to meet the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timetable for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the timetable for our plan for 2019-2020, thus allowing more time for budget formulation, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while all those who need or want to work will be given a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps as soon as they receive the appropriate confirmation.
Thank the APP team for their leadership.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But in addition to the many precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
They used the anti-virus medical class solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the receiving and elevator holdings through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is on the Web site of WeWork, which shared with us and all staff in DC with its COVID-19 regulations.
Last week, our office in the District of Colombia has completely moved to a remote job, as instructed in San Francisco.
As some of our New York colleagues know, we have also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the meeting time limit to one to two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them into a multi-day course.
Determine clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and provide advance information.
By default, use a video link to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a focal point — the person who will follow up the questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers and the person who is responsible for the notes (or joint observation).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Use your Wellness Reimbursement benefits when buying a snack.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
HR Operations is studying web-based ergonomics manuals to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week we asked all community grantees to cancel mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as \"editathons\", until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the inability to carry out concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for or altered by forced delays.
In the coming week, we will follow up on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
General sentiments in the global community are not only a frustration at the interruption of work, but also some relief from mutual understanding and an opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide a community space to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in contact on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar to the special staff meeting next Thursday, 14 p.m. UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to further share up-to-date information, answer your questions, and work together to engage one another.
Together, we are ready to help whatever we can.
At the same time, you may continue to receive information from such e-mail and other important information on COVID-19 from the Office of the Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
If questions about travel, activities, key workflows, problems with reporting or other assistance are available, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and liaison as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and of our obligations.
Rather, it is recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue working, in order to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for important work to be undertaken in the weeks ahead and perhaps in the months ahead.
For that to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families and to work with maximum effect as soon as the need arises.
Now please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the remaining members of Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-transverse enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-transmitting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) by making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some Coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotensin-translating enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ferret located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
Belka ACE2 contains the N-end peptidase domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collectrine.
ACE2 is a Type I single-pass membrane protein, and its fermentably active domain falls on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The non-celled ACE2 domain is broken off from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as seddase, and the dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar lung cells type II, the enterocytes of the thin intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscles cells of the arteries of most organs.
The biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, strategum, hypothalamus and brain trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterweight of ACE.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, breaks off the carboxyl end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilate angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also dilate a number of other peptidides, including [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, aplene, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present for Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 strand of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the fermentable domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the transmission of both virus and enzyme to the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the protein S serine protease of TMPRSS2 which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool and has led some to believe that lower levels of ACE2 in cells can help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced for patients receiving APF inhibitors that were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although results have been less reliable than patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new development in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in growing with acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by lipopolisacharids.
The half-out period rhACE2 is about 10 hours for people and the start of operation is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours for exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with non-translational classical renin angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or diseases that raise circulating angiotensin II. The rhACE2 introduced has been assessed in clinical trials for treatment of acute respiratory dysdrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the Cronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, i.e. in identifying persons (“contacts”) who were able to communicate with the infected person.
In some regions, many annexes have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options have been developed for monitoring contacts.
This has led to discussions on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
The softer options include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate support for these applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, using an application called TraceTogether in Singapore.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be placed under the control of the Government. North Macedonia launched the StopKorona! annex, which is working on Bluetooth to monitor contacts with potentially infected persons and to ensure prompt communication with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was awaiting registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks; similar applications were scheduled to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the applications based on the Singapore Annex TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use a geo-zoning application designed to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including failure and potential inefficiency in the case of the application of only a small portion of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful \"coronavirus\" applications, Apple has restricted the list of types of organizations that can offer its annexes related to the Coronavirus to App Store, with only \"official\" or other reliable organizations included in the list.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants in the campaigns for the protection of confidentiality expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through annexes related to the Coronavirus; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the observation infrastructure established to combat the Coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for a limitation of this type of oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for them to be subject to government projects:
Surveillance must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitations on duration;
Data use should be limited to COVID-19 targets;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid cases of exacerbated discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to react to abuses must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ahne Grenzen) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the issue of ongoing surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, network tracking of locations is used instead of applications, which precludes the need to load the annex and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality, which use central servers only for communications (see below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track communications.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to generate notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only has the Government used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected persons, but it has also provided information on the location of the public, which has been made possible by significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that has been introduced since the MERS outbreak in that country.
A number of applications and websites have access to such information, and countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol; decentralized protocols include decentralized confidentiality tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Content EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile phone tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifying personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur there.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for maintaining confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the proliferation of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on studies in Aps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a confidentiality technology company, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without exposing them to the risk of confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded on a global coalition of TCNs aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled the operation of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality and based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allowed confidentiality to be maintained.
They also published the technical characteristics of the major technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Provision of tools to enable Governments to establish formal applications to monitor the movement of persons infected by the Coronavirus, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address the ongoing surveillance problems by first implementing the system through the upgrade of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic diversion of drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than a disease originally envisaged in the design.
This is one of the scientific studies currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and reservative plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-produced proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 are papin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussein AA and the co-sponsors, in their pre-clinical study, studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarity by structure with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorine is an antimalarial drug, which is also used in the treatment of certain automymun diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be one of the four drugs studied under the “Solinity” clinical test.
The governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the trials of chloroquine and chlorochloroquine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of chlorochloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical test process and is only permitted under the EUA as a pilot treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive clinical test treatment.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there's no other solution.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langon examines the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine use.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhana and Shenzhen showed that the favipiravier is “one thing that is manifestly effective”.
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had an average of four days after the drug, while 45 patients who did not receive the drug had 11 days of the illness.
In Uhana, a study was conducted in which 240 pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of them Favipiravir and the other Umifenovier.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Department reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that Japan would purchase a drug to replenish its stocks and that military resources would be used for its delivery to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed Trump of the possibility of purchasing a drug, a drug that may be less effective in the cases that have been started.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients trying to get pregnant.
A study on the combination of antiviral drugs “lopinover” and “ritonavier” (Caletra) concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been detected”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will link to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, the reprofiling of drugs that have been specially designed for HIV and AIDS treatment has been criticized.
WHO has incorporated a combination of lapinavier and ritonavir into the international test of Solidarity.
Remdesilier was created and developed by Giled Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and marburg virus infections, and employees from Giled Sciences discovered that the remdesir is in vitro antiviral activity with regard to multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that the remdescier can have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are currently being conducted, including two conducted by Cleveland university clinics; one performed by moderate-positive patients; and the other conducted by patients with more severe ailments.
Three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious COVID-19 are currently under way: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one placebo-free study (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, Asian antibiotics began testing in New York State.

Phase II testing, the form of angiotensin vertebrate enzyme 2, involves 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of cochicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications among patients with low levels of COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over were invited to have COVID-19 diagnosed with light symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in the study.
There are several coagulants on the test in Italy.
Low-Commolular Heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Agency for Medicines to publish recommendations on the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multi-centre study involving 300 patients on the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific focus has been placed on reprofiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Fishavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovier: Umifenovier was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially usable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilisumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilyzumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the COVID-19 hormone of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, many attempts to develop the vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI ' s vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms for effective vaccine against COVID-19 were under study and development in early 2020.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I and vaccine candidate: Modernna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino biologics, Adnovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been reported, but there is little public information available (it is believed to be in the planning or development stage).
Preliminary safety and immunogenic testing is conducted during phases I-II, generally rancidized, placebo-controlled and in several sites, with a simultaneous determination of more precise and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests typically covers more participants, including the control group, at which stage the drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease and the side effects of optimal dosage are monitored simultaneously.
Of the 79 vaccinators active in development (approved early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested for human beings (still in the pre-clinical studies stage).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was examining the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an accelerated mode it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies, they had created a part of a coronavirus-like particle.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory studies and testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “greater money” for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine, which the German Government protested against.
On 17 March 2020, the United States pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for joint development of an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is an IRNA-based vaccine candidate; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical tests and the clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takais Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive pre-clinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate could begin testing people in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Epidemics (CEPI), France, announced $4.9 million for the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI's overall investment in COVID-19 vaccine development is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in vaccine development from COVID-19 are Modernna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities in Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different animal vaccine candidates.
Imperial College researchers, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing self-amplifying RNA-vaccin from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the receipt of a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government pledged $275 million to fund 96 research projects on health countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian Government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1, generating strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] 2 weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Waterloo University Canadian Pharmaceutical School announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine that might be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce inside human bacteria and produce harmless viruslike particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources together with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can also have other benefits in addition to disease prevention.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies on animal vaccine assessment, characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to control Biosafety 3 infections in living virus treatment, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vacancies against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, there is no drug or protective vaccine for the treatment of SARS that is safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to be distributed, it was believed that the SARS study at that time could be the standard for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (substantial DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which was stage I clinical trials for people, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based and were in the process of development, two Adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networking spread the conspiracy theory, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that the vaccine already existed from it.
Social networks cited the words of some patients who claimed patents for genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS Coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of acne, and stomach pain.
The initial symptoms to the peak are usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are related to lung symptoms, but in some cases the disease is in viral pneumonia and poly organ deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people were killed.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, the virus is mostly spreading through close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drips occur during exhalation, they are usually threatened by falling to the ground or on the surface but are not transmitted through the air at great distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infected within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may be possible before or at later stages of symptoms.The standard diagnostic method is polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (RT-PPD) on a sample taken from the nose.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of illness as well as to those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of health masks vary from one population to another: some agencies recommend that they be avoided at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local disease was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms, or may have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and swelling.
Extreme symptoms include obstructed breathing, constant pain or chest severance, confusion of mind, problems of awakening, sleeping of the person or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
There may be fewer symptoms of upper respiratory tracts, such as sneezing, sneezing, or pain in the throat.
Also, the percentages show gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, rhubarb and diarrhea.
Some of the cases reported in China have originally been shown to be only a sense of chest pressure and an increased heart rate.
In some cases, the disease may progress into pneumonia and eventually lead to death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, the symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days of infection, and there is evidence that not all infected persons are affected.
The role of such non-symptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data indicate that it can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected persons with a non-symptomatic disease is currently unknown and only studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations regarding the virus were non-symptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases in its daily report from 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be detected at the time of testing.
Both wet and slurry can have a higher virus concentration.
With loud speech, more drops appear in the air than when speaking normal loudness.
A study in Singapore found that when the cough is open, the chapels can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not normally air-borne, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transfer of particles from the bioaerosolated virus was still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms showed the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation (SLRs), may result in the spraying of exhalation products and hence the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may be spread through feces, but this risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most contagion when symptoms occur; the spread of the virus may be low before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easy the virus is to spread, but it is clear that one patient usually infects two to three other people. The virus can survive from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface, the virus was capable of living for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304), up to three days, and on 99 percent of copper surfaces, up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
When used correctly, soap and detergents have a fairly useful anti-infection effect: the soap destroys the virus's oily protective layer and thus deactivates it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconychloride and chlorohexidine gluconeate (surgical disinficing agent) are less effective against the virus.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, slurry samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients showed the highest blood concentration, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe coronary respiratory syndrome that was first diagnosed with three people with pneumonia in a group with acute respiratory problems registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in the naturally related Coronaviers.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which exposes it to a protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the baseline SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates the host cells through angiotensin-translating enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in light type II alveolar cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein called spike (peplomer).
12 per cent of infected people admitted to the Uhana hospital were diagnosed with severe myocardial damage, which occurs more frequently in severe cases.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system impairments during the progression of the disease, but severe damage to the myocardial may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolia (25 per cent) was observed among patients at OIT from COVID-19 and could indicate adverse projections. The autopia of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing infiltration in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism with ACE2-expressive respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hypersuppression.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-KSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 inflammatory monocytes and the heavy lung pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrations were also detected at the autopsy.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respirator samples obtained by the nose of the nose, but the sample of the nose or wet may also be used.
The results are usually ready for a period of between a few hours and two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are irrelevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to assign a coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, anti-body tests that could detect current-time infection, as well as possible infections in the past, have been developed but have not yet been widely disseminated.
The Chinese experience of examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only 60 - 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostics test, authorizing its application at the end of this month, and the diagnostic guidelines issued by the hospital at Zjunnan Uhan University indicate methods for detecting infection on the basis of clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral long-range sub-pleural focussing by type of \"math glass\" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteural distributions are frequent symptoms that are detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, the symptoms of the buly bridge (longer tightening of the partition with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic impacts and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main findings of a pathological discovery study:
Macrocopy: pleurititis, pericarditis, compaction, and lung accumulator
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild form of pneumonia: lung eye, pneumonia hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory dysstress syndrome (SDDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Congestion pneumonia: organization of exsudates in alveolar fields and lung interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coupling (AFS-syndrome); leukeroritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include living in the home, avoiding people's places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding eye, nose, or mercury with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a naphette when coughing or sneezing, or that, in the absence of a naphette, the mouth and nose be covered by the inside of the elbow of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hygiene procedure be performed for the hands.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that tissue face masks be used in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infections to people with non-symptomatic disease; social distance strategies are designed to reduce contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted movement of citizens and eliminated major public events.
Distance recommendations also imply that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no proven effectiveness medication against COVID-19. As the completion of the vaccine is not expected until 2021, the majority of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “placarding”.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or when the hands are heavily contaminated, as well as before eating and after slicing, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfection alcohol (at least 60% alcohol), but only when soap and water are not available, and WHO provides two recipes for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These compositions use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hands treatment.
Glycerol is added as a wetter.
Patients have been shown to have support for therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other severely affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Respect for personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet is recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptomatic symptoms at the early stages of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the IBCC free of charge.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend choosing to favour paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
When carrying out procedures that may result in air-crap emissions, such as intubation or hand-sucking, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities.
CDC recommends that health care personnel from COVID-19 be placed in an air-cage unit (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC has issued recommendations on the use of individual protection equipment (SIS) during the pandemic.
The recommended personal protective equipment is a protective robe, a respirator or a medical mask, eye protection equipment and medical gloves, and it is preferable to use repeaters rather than medical masks as the means listed above.
N95 repeaters have been approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
They are intended for protection against particles in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed effectiveness against a specific biological agent when using instructions.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, in extreme cases, the making of masks on its own in the home environment.
In most cases, COVID-19 flows are not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there are also some percentage of cases where this is required.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is currently under study, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of a nose-oxygen canal with intense air flow or two-level positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition are as effective as the AVL.
Some doctors choose to use invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, since this method significantly limits the distribution of particles in the air compared to an intense airflow, a risk of a severe illness for older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with a dramatic increase in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in a serious form requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for pulmonary ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually get resuscated.
The challenge of artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as the acute respiratory dystherapy syndrome (ARDS) developing under COVID-19 is becoming increasingly problematic.
Inhaled and inhaled IVVs are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure the minimum damage to them by a vent causing the pneumotorx to develop.
On earlier models of high-level PCDC fans may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are currently under clinical testing.
Remdesir is the most promising one.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of testing.
Resistance drugs can be tested for patients with severe forms of illness.
The WHO recommended volunteers are involved in performance and safety tests on potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary permission to use reservative plasma as a pilot treatment when a person ' s life is seriously or directly at risk.
It has not been clinically researched to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak of disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The annex may detect “close contact” through observation data and, therefore, identify potential risks of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected persons and persons with whom they have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor mobile phone data for people suspected to be infected by the Coronavirus.
Measures had been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the German federal government agencies and the Robert Koh Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
A detection technology was introduced in Russia to identify quarantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Galler, reported that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of people still move across the Territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, attended by more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kalulaid, also called for creative solutions to be found against the spread of the Coronavirus.
People may be under stress because of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Enhanced social exclusion, loneliness, concerns about health, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people”.
Diseases can manifest in a light form, with few or no symptoms that resemble other common respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
In general, patients with a mild form of disease are treated within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may take between three and six weeks to treat them.
Women who are pregnant may be at higher risk of receiving a severe COVID-19 form, based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although no such data are available for COVID-19. Some people COVID-19 may be affected by the light and cause pneumonia as a problem.
People with the most severe COVID-19 disease may progress rapidly in acute respiratory dystherapy syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorgan insufficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous platelet, heart problems, kidneys and liver problems.
Thrombonic anomalies, especially the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients who entered the hospital from COVID-19, while the kidney function was violated in 4% of the group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
Early research suggests that the average initial symptoms to death were 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8 per cent and the female mortality rate was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples reveal diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exsedates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the light was reminiscent of the acute respiratory dysstress syndrome (DSS).
In 11.8% of deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
Rates of mortality vary from one condition to another due to regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficient evaluation of cases in light form could lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
Smokers had severe COVID-19 symptoms increased at a total rate of 1.4 times, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive therapy or die than non-smokers, and fears were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
One of Hong Kong’s clinics found that some patients who were cured of the disease had a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in lung volume and that their scans had been damaged.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After intense therapy” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether virus-treated patients had persistent immunity against them.
Based on the current of the other Coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but it has also been reported that after recovery from COVID-19 tests, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increase in the prolonged duration of the disease rather than a recurrence of the infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, to have animal origin and to be an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to the earliest date of the first case on 1 December 2019.
According to official figures published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary from region to region to time of disease, and are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment patterns used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population's parameters, such as age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, WHO issued emergency codes for ICB-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of death to infection is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain period of time.
According to the Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2240,191).
Some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the completion of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, the presence of these antibodies shows how many people have been infected.
At the outbreak epicentre in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, the disease was spreading among young people during the carnival celebration, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates varied for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy indicate that the mortality rate is higher for men.
The highest-risk group is men over 50 years of age, and the gap between men and women declines only from the age of 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise causes of this difference are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, a lower incidence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g., hypertension among men at a younger age than among women) can lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, and therefore they are more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Guebreisus, explains: “CO” means “root”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “infection” (disease), and 19 — the year when the outbreak first occurred: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the name to prevent stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO further uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both diseases and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhana, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the Coronavirus and the Uhank Coronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms “extreme respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for virus and disease.
Official titles “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to restrictions on standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nose-to-nose tympons, as well as the details of AVL machines.
In one such case, an Italian clinic was urgently in need of a vent valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, one of the local factories was reproduced and was able to print the 100 valves needed per night.
Following the first outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet has become a high-speed conspiracy theory, misinformation and feicing information on the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
Humans are likely to infect other animals with virus.
The results of the research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
To date, there is no approved vaccine for viruses or medicines to treat them.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test), which aims to assess the treatment effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready-made vaccine, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells through the ACE2 receptor, so research uses previous studies on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is designed to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unital vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus subjects.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying S-symbol protein, which helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
A third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA-vacine, a new vaccine methodology).
Pilot vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine for four volunteers was started in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus, which causes disease, and the anti-tolosavirus strengthening has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are being conducted.
The approved malaria treatment was assessed in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remodicy have been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 was also carried out. To this end, several other available antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdecyleur, chloroquine and chloroquine, loppinavier/ritonavier, and loppinavier / ritonavier combined with interferon beta, were also considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the remuxiliary.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients who received remodisyre as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical trials has already been carried out in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used to treat malaria was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The U.S. Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the urgent use of chloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also refers to interferon, fishavirin or umifenovier as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitozoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that in order for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the SARS-2 receptor, it is necessary to accept the protein of the snipe of the remembrane sulphase 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without nitrogen has severe limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.Oseltomvir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in treating COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may result as complications at late stages of heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia, as a result of a small study by the National Health Commission of China, the recommendation to treat the coronavirus has been included.
This drug resulted in a 2 phase non-remandated test conducted at the national level in Italy after positive results were obtained from patients with severe illness.
Combined with a study of ferritin blood serums to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractoral cytokines caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no Randomized and controlled evidence that tocilisumab is an effective treatment for cytokine syndrome.
The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to the people in need is now considered a non-vaccinary method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for patients with SARS, but its results are not convincing.
The virus ' s neutralization is the expected effect by which passive anti-threat therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-body-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive therapy by antibodies, such as those produced by monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconsistent blood serum, which consists of a fluid part of the blood of cured patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronavirus disease, high-prevalence syndrome group
Lee Wenlian, a doctor at the central Uhanya clinic, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
