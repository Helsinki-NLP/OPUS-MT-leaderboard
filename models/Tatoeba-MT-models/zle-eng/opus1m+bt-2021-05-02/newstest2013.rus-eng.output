Republican strategy for resistance to the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policies with the need to combat forgeries in elections.
However, at the Brennan Center, the latest myth is considered to be more rare in the United States than in the case of deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers found only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.
One can be said to be certain that these new trends will have a negative impact on voter performance.
In this sense, such actions are partially discredited by the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal U.S. elections.
That is why most state governments have adopted laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to republics in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 laws restricted voting rights in 41 states were passed.
The new electoral laws require the elector to present a identity card with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the voter registration right on the day of expression and take away the right to vote from citizens with judges.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state had obliged voters to present a identity card with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities have hurried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills obliging voters to present identity cards with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million of them who have reached the age required, do not have the identification card issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identification card with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use the identity card with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use the permits issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no State required proof of United States nationality to vote.
For the first time, such a demand was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American voters.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
This limitation has not gone without its consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
However, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total state voters.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of voters represented 24 per cent of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of the voters had voted before.
Of course, Democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to enacting laws that restrict voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetoed by Democratic Governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended when the United States Prosecutor General intervened.
This made it possible to limit in part the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of identity cards with photographs.
However, the new rules that had entered into force clearly made it difficult to exercise electoral law in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of laws that have been enacted to see them as clearly aimed at influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the States that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter appearance.
In this sense, such actions are partially discredited by the system of American democracy.
The cancer screening of the right gland, whether it's a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, false and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical interventions.
Men are reluctant to be dispensated, and there is more to doubt.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies in the United States have found many cases of infection among the groups studied, and it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to come up with any clear recommendations.
Another study, European this time, found different levels of mortality among patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
This study also showed that after 12 years of observation, metastasis is 30-40 per cent higher among those who have not gone through screening.
Therefore, I would recommend a 50-year test, or 40-year-old if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be either aggressive or violent.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without necessarily treating prostate cancer, which is not a long-term risk to life, but by choosing in these cases to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive or life threatening.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we have defined criteria with accuracy for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I'd recommend a test anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
Movember, in collaboration with the International Association of Urology, has developed a tool to evaluate everything for and against the PSA test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of illness.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cancer cases could have been prevented if all people had been well nourished and had been moving enough.
- If no one else smoked, the figure would increase to at least 50 per cent - - emphasised by André Bolier, press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancers are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, tobacco control remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It has caused enormous damage to human health.
“ Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” says press secretary André Bolier.
It is encouraging to note that 10 years after giving up smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weights
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and colon, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
Studies show that regular physical activity throughout the life cycle protects the colon cancer - they are added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by digging, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
- The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer - explained to the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But to date, the results of these studies are not unambiguous.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies have produced contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also not fully clear.
He stressed, however, that it was important to discuss his concerns and family anthem with a doctor.
- The analysis does not lead to cancer -
Higgs Boson in detail
Last summer reports that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson have caused real agitation, and not without reason.
This boson is said to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is the last particle that was predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or in any case, the most imperfect - of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which had previously failed to be detected through experience.
But the physicists aren't quite sure it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson, as predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet fully reliable.
Let's imagine what Higgs boson is, because the chances of error seem minimal, and let's see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law completely inevitable, that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to bypass this rule, even if you try too hard, or you do not want to hurt yourself.
But while elementary particle physics is a rather strange world, it also proves that there is one law of this nature: the principle of the deletion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they remain in the same position - this is the state - it is in general, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called farms who wisely follow Pauli’s principle.
Another is the bosons, a vicious band of anarchists who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they can rest in the same place at the same time.
According to the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the particles of power, through which the basic forces of nature are spread, and which include the Higgs boson.
These same bosons should be stressed, not all of the exotic creatures that you might think of.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or part of the light, which is the skinner, the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field in this particular location, roughly like a rock thrown into a pond.
The result is an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon -- and therefore one of the force carriers' bosons --
A More Stable Field
The same thing happens to Higgs' boson, with only the difference that for this boson to come up, it must be -- broken -- the other field, the Higgs field.
However, Higgs' field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to trigger it, very and very high energy must be achieved, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only be broken by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one used in CERNE, the Great Adron Collider, which is a ring 27 km in diameter! to achieve such enormous energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are also useful to explain the relationship between Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, while others do not — a sheet of paper, for example, will never be kept in a refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others do not.
So, what can she do to bring in all these studies, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM) and this also allows physicists to sense the difference between the observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them are passionately eager to find such a difference, that the slightest discrepancy can open the door for new physics and shut up some of the Modeli holes.
The latter, it should be said, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (hey!) or dark matter, which produces about 80 percent of the universe (hey!).
But as yet, there's no such difference in CERN.
Consequences
It would be more difficult to predict the use of these studies for the everyday life of an average person, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no one.
Look, at the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bella's labs could not even have been able to predict what revolution would bring them to work.
And they foretold their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally regarded rather as a laboratory gadget -
Imagine...
In addition, the annex may be found for tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his 1969 optical studies.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as the “gloss” for all digital cameras in the world and deserves the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Greater Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that it can.
Palliative aid is the best way to die.
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and a bill was being prepared at that time.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
- Dolg tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer, which destroyed him from within, gave him a two-year delay.
- I've been given five years, I've lived seven years, he says, between life and death, I'm in bed in Victor Gadboua's palliative care shelter in Belya, where I arrived on the eve of the day before.
- But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it, he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating your own food.
While sitting at a table where the meal is good, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's worried, he's even going to smile, he's talking to strangers who's working around him, bringing drugs to him, taking him to the bathroom.
Courage in the face of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire for treatment from diarrhea is humiliating — he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
During his life, we're taught that a man has to be on his guard . . . . . Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois shelter.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some inexorable humiliation.
\"All depends on a person's ability to deal with decay,\" he asserts.
Since many palliative care workers feel that important events have occurred at the very beginning of this decline.
Patients who enter Victor Gadbois palliative shelter, all with cancer.
Projections take them for a maximum of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance known as treatment services.
Mrs. A., 89 years of age, most afraid of dying -- in the mind of being choked --
But then the illness made me know my children.
- I have good kids. - She adds.
\"I don't want anything else in my life,\" she says, \"before I let her have a mask to make her breathe easier.
She is still awaiting her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
The Victor Gadbois shelter provides body care and nutrition services through a group of volunteers.
That's the palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants have one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
This is where life continues in the best conditions possible, explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the shelter doctors.
Whether it be physical, emotional, or emotional comfort.
The dying one will agree to provide the brandy or pepsy mouths, as he asks.
We no longer make diabetics control sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son had that beer in his feet at the dead man's feet.
- We're helping loved ones, as are the patients - - he's telling Natalie Sawar, director of care for the sick.
The Victor Gadboua shelter doesn't look like the previous day.
Along with a 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old youth, surrounded by parents, his wife and two young children, dies tragically to survive.
“ In the last six months, from three to five beds, always employed by cancer patients under 45 years of age,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbois shelter arrive from the home and 47 per cent of the hospital.
The Problem of Access to Palliative Care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbois shelter and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this great gap in the health system in Quebec that makes many palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Beginning in October, a manifest signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Leupunt, are circulating and testifying to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Québec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance station in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day despite pessimistic predictions.
The hope of survival by Ellen Richard was already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologu that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told me.
At the same time, she told me that my days were counted!
No comprehensive care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients seeking death are assisted by medical personnel for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all - powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monro, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are not sensitive to 8% of pain disorder.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps to the point of death, either from time to time or from time to time.
We can no longer pretend to be unaware of these sufferings.
More and more patients unable to ease the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Those who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: \"I want to die\"
But that doesn't necessarily mean I want euthanasia -- it means -- I want to get easier --
The report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fund collectors and Italian mafia experts report day by day what they know about the vast - building system — the instigating construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
- The industry, which cost Quebec taxpayers very dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
♪ It's kind of like, how it's spread out after all the money has been let go ♪ Jacques Dusheno, deputy and former chief of the Montreal police ♪
It was because of the scandal in 2011 that it was a side effect of investigating official crimes related to the Quebec road-building contracts, to which the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Share, had agreed very reluctantly.
The Dusheno Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
Since the initiation of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that the Ministry of Transport alone would have kept billions of dollars in contracts - if some had held back their interest.
The Charbono Commission has already removed two mayors, and he adds, hoping that it will be able to -- open up the schemes behind the individual personalities --
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, comprised of a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the personnel of the special unit, Molot, who had forced the permanent cartel, Montreal, after 2009, to terminate over-estimation of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richara Marcotta, the Mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gille Vayancourt, recently retired mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving bribes repeatedly in public orders.
In addition, several engineers in the Montreal reporting service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkuro and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter blew up a real bomb, following a system of government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to some mafia-related mediator who, in turn, transferred the money of the party to Mayor Gerald Tramble-United Montreal -
In the 2000s, Zambito cut his money to the right and his money to the left, and listed more than US$ 88,000 (about Euro68 000) to the various provincial parties, mainly the liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Canalization contracts in which value was overstated
In Montreal, corruption worked unrelentingly.
Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for the channelling contracts he had overvalued.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they had been on foot overaccounts of 30-40 per cent with false additions.
Then Mr. Trambley, the organizer of the mayor's party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately shutting his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cashes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramblay resigned early in November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first members in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the Rivière de Prérie District in the east of the island has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a five million dollar municipal site and resold for 1.6 million builders in the midst of the building boom.
70 per cent of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would eventually begin, she would go after a thread to understand the functioning of an ant system to stop gangrene and identify those responsible,
It is a painful but positive process -
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we're leaving home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno notes from his side that the perpetrators stole hundreds of millions of dollars — but he is particularly concerned about the role of the elected officials who knew of the scheme — but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the percentage of dirty money in funding the Quebec election campaign reached 70 per cent, he jokes: “I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality —
The Government of Québec proposes to limit to $100 a donation to parties, but he says that this will not change the situation: “As long as we do not strictly limit elected expenses, the policy will be dirty money.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down below; with boldness, we are able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls upon those who laugh to look in their own courtyard...
- It's not Barcelona's FC.
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale at the PJC.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be a new measurement of SPM.
Big players have arrived.
I'm growing up with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything's happening very fast.
But I don't fall apart.
From the very beginning at the Preliminary Training Centre at Clerphonten in the NIF, until my arrival in St. Estienne, I have always gone forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set by Carlo Anchelotti...
The addition of this summer is not a good news of playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is very important.
It causes a player like me to want to be at the level and to be at the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's assisted by vices like Claude Mackele, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotty the master of the position?
Of course.
Anchelotti is a source of respect for all technical personnel.
Today he is not equal in the First League, and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left the entire series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PJH season?
In the First League, Lyon took our seat as leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified for the eighth final.
What is the club's purpose in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish up first in our group, before Porto, to be able to have a match in the eighth final.
Would the U.S.A. be able to become the first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure positions over the long term.
It's not true today.
Financially, SPM has the means to make this project real.
Shouldn't take the title in the First League, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want this champion title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, there was disappointment, because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a general rule, 79 points are a champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, was playing an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Lyon, and Bordeaux joined the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media is waiting too much for SPM?
It's normal that we're expected to have a lot, given the amount that was invested and the players we have.
We're completely ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Trout, and we find ourselves being criticized for something, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We'll never be able to win every 4-0 weekend.
We're not Barcelona's FK!
We're trying to put in a game project.
The command is formed over time.
We have proven in the League of Champions that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has been unable to make two seasons in the eighth year, even though they have also spent a huge amount of money!
In view of the amounts invested, you were represented 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be contempt for our opponents and for the French champion.
Lyon and Marseilles, who were not up in the last season, were - were disappointed - with this new SPM.
This shows how engaging the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The U.S.R. seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimović.
Well, if you say there's some kind of \"Golden Dependency\"
This simply means that Ibrahimovitch is very successful and that he loses many heads.
He's here to prove that he's a First League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a big player and a global star.
In the group, we respect him as a human being and as a player.
He also respects people who surround him.
What he's done is really the only thing.
This stimulates others to improve their play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you get through Euro2012 with French assembly?
Like disappointment.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from losing some playtime.
I saw a lot of things out there, and I got more out of there.
Today, I manage to play good game games.
That's what I've been hoping since I was baptized with Sinih.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine and are now required to behave exemplaryally.
What do you think of Didier Desham's first moons in the middle of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got good positions in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspiring winning.
What Laurent Blanc was?
But I don't want to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, and he has qualified us for Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will lead the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1), who broke out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no matches like that in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks with Bitcoin.
The full contrast to the current cash exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with fees for processing them.
Moreover, as these technologies often experience, a political vision is obvious: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satosha Nakamoto (pseudon), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file sharing between participants at the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of sites have been accepted for donations or as payment.
The bitcoin course reached a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2 before returning today to about ten dollars (the courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special about the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its Virtual Currency Report, published in October, was interested in the system.
He describes bitcoin as the most successful virtual currency -- competing with a dollar or a euro -- and similar to conventional currencies --
Bitkin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as credit, used to advance video games, which are made into games or which are possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchanges always control and process a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of the ledger, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does the network function?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mails, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relevant to the transaction is electronically signed using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitons used in the transaction do exist in a public account sent over the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like the temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is the hashing phase of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file to a digital signature, a short and unique one.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before you hash it all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give you a unique digital signature (a multiple zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes are easy to verify that it is correct.
Transactions are thus made irreversibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will alter the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of fraud, the user would be very quick (less than 10 minutes) to pay twice the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitks.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is likely to divide by half regularly by the end of 2012.
The number of beaters is therefore limited to 21 million, but divided to one hundred million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computational capacity.
The network has already experienced ups and downs.
Bitcoin sites were attacked and the bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself - it assures Pierre Nouza who recently started Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the account book and found that nearly 80 per cent of bitters were not in circulation.
“Gigant sales” were announced in November.
- Three hundred thousand dollars were exchanged by Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency allowance, firmly believes in the technology's potential as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The possessor has better control over his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new tools or software.
It's just enough to give an address that you can take a picture and identify with -- the phone, Pierre Nuaza, who says he's already got thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to re-evaluate hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
- Except for Bitcoin, it'll be a while, but 2013 can be a turning point - it predicts.
The ECB, in its report, intends, by the way, to review the various risks that are now considered to be high if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capist and Surabi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, not only for us.
We were mainly affected by Afghan peasants whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, their old and archaic, and even their Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but not anymore as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hill of the almond trees, thanks to French loans, took place in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since they moved steadily from 1994 to 1996.
At the time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fighting between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a release, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for these peasants who have surpassed Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The ex-Majaheds, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become State-owned dealers to resell them to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, making use of the huge United States subcontracts.
They're discredited; most of them didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that is not a thief.
Many young people want to leave as those who have succeeded in American generosity move away — capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they valued its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with boys and girls alike.
The workplaces of these young people should be provided, who will not want to return to the old parties' darkness or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the world today, and which are watching everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities who will command her will be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial wives who are not under central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some degree, along the lines of Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized State with strong presidential power, eliminating the Prime Minister's post, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
Industry has not been put on the legs, no dam is in operation, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This has only reinforced the feeling that the western countries were there only to take possession of them.
No energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export through mountains, no minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the location of Med. Mes. Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which rely heavily on imports and exports, restore normal relations on a good day.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: the faces of girls, boys, the French Faculty at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds, and the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defence's military civil service (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French community organization, has contributed to a large number of social activities and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, have been able to help contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing the area of arable land.
What do we keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural works originating from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they said, to give them, a little non-military support that would be well-supervised and directly directed towards them.
Employed descendants of Egypt ' s Constitution
This is President Mohammed Mursey's new venture.
While Egypt had more than ever been divided on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it had decided to play a wa-bank.
Settled by everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
For two years now, as Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, thus weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his autocratic bridle - continuing to violate the word - and to uphold the right -
In the camp of his followers, they are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which forces Abraham to abandon his intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article behind the article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote comes to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “If you vote for my text, or if I leave an emergency power — which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, most of them Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had hit the door, feeling unable to deliver their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order for the required quorum to be reached, 11 people, the reserve participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the articles have been voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, avoided the fact that one of the few differences in the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee thought that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been wrong.
The text which was voted on yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 eventually remained the same article in the 1971 Constitution, stating that the Shariah Principles are the primary source of the right -
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules” so that they could be applied more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a demonstration of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals who see it are just a pier respond.
Because they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point particularly to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, inter alia, with regard to the verification of the conformity of sharia laws.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, i.e., people who are intended to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy --
We can see theocracy coming in--
Many liberals are also inspired by the fact that the next rector of the university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ultim, but people with university studies, some have studied in the French system, and they restate Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “the scope of article 220 may be ambiguous, since the terms used in it are derived from religious vocabulary.
This applies, in particular, to the c-fikh- [Islamic jurisprudence, pd.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civilian judges are to make decisions on this,
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly declined compared to the ones under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will not take place in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
There will also be no prohibitions on the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text which they considered destructive to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy had been maintained and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles on the protection of women any more, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Wrights Wach.
She said that the only positive step was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that has not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to perform on television yesterday evening, the manifests are scheduled to take place this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will, in turn, go outside on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the Pupe of the Earth, and the Sea of Explosion
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, the present comfort, and the primacy of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why we should visit Israel.
Worshiping Holy Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, should be visited.
It is believed that all those who enter this kupel are going to meet God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: turning water into wine in a wedding, walking about by water, resting the storm, and filling the nets.
And here Jesus appeared before the disciples, and after his resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through the Scorby Path or the Jesus Christ Way.
He begins with the stronghold of Antony the Pretoria, where the judgment was held, and in the streets of the Old City he brings to the Temple of the Lord on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointed One, and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pupe of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem will be erected at a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which the cross was made to crucify Jesus.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, Stan Plac, left behind a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
It is customary for people of different confessions to leave notes with wishes that follow.
Make a Vertical Travel
The ruins of Masada's fortress remained hidden from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high mountain cliffs at 450 m above ocean level.
Only those involved in alpineism can make their way.
The others on this historic peak deliver a lift on the rope road.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 240 metres, is the famous Hermon mining resort, where a huge tourist influx takes place during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain brings the shuttle bus.
The total length of the mining track is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in that country.
You can't go on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, near Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition is well represented in the paintings of the Impressionist and Expressionist Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisleya, Matisse, Modillani, Shagala, Pikasso.
In Akko it is possible to visit the Al-Bash Museum, which is a few halls of old Turkish cans with visitors' and bankers' mules at the time.
In Casearia, we should go to the unique Rally Museum, where we can enjoy sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There's no guide or souvenir benches.
Entry is free and donations are not categorically accepted.
The Fifth Museum of the Holocaust or Yad-Wash in Tel Aviv is one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you get in the darkness of absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Say hello.
The three main resort zones of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has basins, aquaparks, dolphins and oceanriums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea bathes even during the winter months, as the temperature of the water does not drop below a warm temperature of 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air warms to about 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, and it bathes for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet, 417 metres below the ocean level.
The spray water in it is a brine that can easily hold a swim without even being able to swim at all.
The landscapes are unreally beautiful.
They eat here to undergo saltwater treatment -- raps and whole dirt -- and to treat with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczemes, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring the nerves to order.
Touch on the Secrets of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It was followed by a famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
It was here that Noah must have built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they had lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of walking along narrow cliffs named after the signs of Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on your street, the sign, Fortuna, will be a favor.
At Jaffo, young people come from all over Israel and even other countries to take photo sessions.
And in Cesaria, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, you can hold the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Cesaria was the principal city of Judah and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully repaired theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Tourist Note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population knows Russian.
Travel money is better charged, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (currently $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa, the country's only metro line, which consists of six stations and links the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funner.
Travel in all modes of urban transport is worth 6 shekels, which can be replanted for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition notes the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation cease.
Sunday morning's the week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher food that excludes pork, seafood, a fish that has no chaschi and a dish that contains milk and meat.
It offers a great choice of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish humus paste, a variety of sauces, hammer balls - phalalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of bottle feeding that's kind of playable on its own.
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on roofs of parked cars.
Ants love people's places and don't give up their sanctuaries.
Rental of the car, depending on the stamp, would cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And rolling a bicycle would cost you 15 shek.
The museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
Citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine were most likely to travel and rest.
There were 118,000 Ukrainian tourists on Earth from January to October 2012, 51 per cent more than the 2010 figure before the removal of visas on 9 February 2011.
- Great and mighty - to Moscow, the migrants are digging money into the tongue.
As long as deputies and human rights defenders argue that they will give a law on mandatory language testing, there are already frauds in the country who trade July certificates.
Every year, 13 million gastorbyters visit Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families who remain in their homeland.
As from 1 December, a law entered into force requiring each working migrant to pass a Russian-language examination.
To date, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing, welfare and retail sectors.
But over time, the FMS is promised, and the tests will be compulsory for everyone.
But it's not just a language, it's also a Russian story, it's also a basis for legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for both the purpose and the extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the State language.
They are not subject to the law and to people who have successfully obtained certificates and diplomas on education before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Benefit, Continuity and Protection of Rights
The network of examination centres will be run under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the ISU, the SGBG and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to establish testing was supported by both the members of the State and the FMS.
The human rights defenders have asked the press many times before the law comes into force: what does it really do?
What will change the requirement of knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, representatives of the migration service will be responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from labour slavery,
Many now speak of the protection of the rights of migrant workers, and explain to the head of the Russian FMS representation in Tajikistan, Victor Ezelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment system would address the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without profession, education, language without medical clearance.
Without an understanding of the language, I am sure, that the future migrant is doomed to face unbelievable people who, under the guise of help, will be moved to a very close barracks, where he and dozens of such ones will spend months of no-food and no-documenting, taking 12 to 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one on their home, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they pick up passports, they are not paid the promised salary” confirms Tolib Sharip, Chief Executive of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Tajikistan.
Don't fight, inhabitant!
Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to earn earnings in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the country in which they want to, but they also find it difficult to write in their own languages.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as it is: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a subtle primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone dress them up, wake them up, and provide them with schooling.
When they are young, they are able to work at the first opportunity.
It is not easy for them to confess if they have a bad knowledge of the tongue.
♪ You feel humiliated and undervalued ♪
Indeed, with regard to the Language Act, human rights defenders have noted one important point.
Only those migrants with legal status will be tested.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent formal work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastorbyters still live illegally in Russia.
- Welcome, or Foreign Entrance
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic and all the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12 and 16,000 roubles.
And this fake registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
Ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea, to share with the journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadam.
- Come on, don't buy it, buy it!
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “lip” certificates for language tests have already been removed by the FMS staff.
Forgery papers are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, they did not provide a price for new owners: each of the migrants thus hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is twice the cost of formal testing: it costs a migrant worker up to 3,000.
The main challenge for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “short” cannot simply be bought, met by both the authorities and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise the gastorbyters who have not successfully passed the first test, time for the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The MUP does not trafficking the illicit arms market
The proportion of legal weapons offences is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to strengthen the law with respect to the holders of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoot at weddings when victimless, and a massacre arranged by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov, killing seven people.
Police want to prohibit the wearing of injury in public places and raise the age at which to obtain a licence for weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Thoughtal Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption of Irin Yarov and promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the State in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by twisting hooks.
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors, from various public small organizations, demand that “no meaningful tightening” be eliminated —
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, reported by the Russian service of the Bi-bi-si criminalist Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 firearms offences registered in internal affairs were committed in six months 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were reported during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil arms legislation does not prevent the offender from entering the black market.
Now, according to them, you can find any weapons in Moscow at a low cost.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has claimed to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Providers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, told by Colonel Victor Barantz, who worked ten years within the Ministry of Education and Henstab.
Scripting of a web site that takes orders for weapons
The first, the army or military trail, is the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
Russian officers, and the Caucasians themselves, are also known as Baranets.
The next kind of black weapon is stolen from the security forces.
Baranets explains that these include both police warehouses and stolen from directly law enforcement officials.
Illegal trunks are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses were often bombed.
- There's a proven version that some of the lights were made specifically - to cover up the shortage - says a former military.
Baranza says that the weapons manufacturers are bringing.
“ Private weapons factories are now being produced that do not tolerate competition on the international market and throw weapons out of the field into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of black is smuggling.
There is a high number of guns and assault rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
- There's their own production, sometimes of handicraft, and there's a mafia that's set up a stream - it explains to the former military.
Where's the weapon?
The experts considered the approximate proportion of each source of illicit arms supply to the black market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open portal data on weapons-related topics.
The bulk of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and the military.
Half of all the weapons on the black market have been found to be in the hands of officials whose work is related to weapons, as stated in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent occur in weapons thefts, and 5 per cent are in black archeology -
A sales consultant for one of the weapons stores who has asked for no name for him has assured him that the weapons found by black miners have not been bought in a long time, too old.
Most of the time, as he says, the salesmen are going to military storage for a new shipment.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's being imputed, passed over the fence.
- He's transporting it to the city, and he's selling it around 900 euros for a thing with two shops. - He's telling us.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so that when a crime plan is under way periodically, they have a control purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons,” adds a consultant.
♪ Like a luxury store ♪
The seller and the buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, on the blogs, until I responded to a friend who offered to come to the Fight platform, where there'll be a person who'll take me to the corner - where we're going to trade.
The price of the trunk I only found out there.
Military examiner Victor Baranets
To get the gun, I need a guy I know who's got the way out, and he tells me the consultant's salesman.
The sellers are on the market, but they also have to come here on a conditional basis, from Ivan Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell her she had a tooth on her back.
I'm getting a couple of tapes right now because of the man I'm sure of.
He's only sending them to me too, because he knows I'm not going to give it up.
The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
A former militaryman, Victor Barantz, tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article to publish it.
The schemes, he said, didn't change.
He was given an album with pictures, where there was anything...
- I felt like a luxury store - - remembers the military.
The buyer, according to Baranza, doesn't offer a cat in the bag -- you can try everything.
I'm not just buying a potential client. We're going to the woods with a salesman. We're putting a target there.
- I'm being given the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapon's going to beat well, start trading, it describes the expert's procedure.

I have heard about such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payments through the ATM.
- In response, they send a picture and instruction where the weapons are hidden - they tell a press secretary of the public organization Right to Arms, Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Barantz claims that if you leave an application on the website, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.

Makarov for $100
Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 could be spent on the purchase of illicit small arms.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the Makarov gun right to gun, you can buy it for $100-300.
We're waiting for a month and a half.

According to official statistics, the number of such crimes for Russia as a whole declined by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22.9 thousand, while the number of facts identified for the theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fastfood workers and supermarkets strike in the United States
Through work at the Macdonalds Cassé, there are up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
There has been a wave of protests over America in recent days against low wages in Walmart University and fast food restaurants such as Macdonalds-Burger King-Tako Bell-Wendis-and-Kentucky Freud Chiken-
As long as no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or that it will be expected to breathe out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries paid by ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the aim of protesters is to establish trade union organizations in them.
To date, this sector of the economy has been largely excluded from the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Red Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, the gripping of millions of people, and sometimes accompanied by pull-ups.
On this day, some Walmart employees, who work 2.2 million worldwide, left their jobs and pictled together with trade unions and left-wing corporate activists whose goods were read to the people of modest and medium-sized wealth.
Walmart sells everything in light, from pens, hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs, and milk.
Its stores average between 8 per cent and 27 per cent cheaper than large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees are retarded only at their jobs.
Walmart, one of America's largest corporations, has been made available and a range of products.
Critics say that Walmart can afford to sell the goods to the house partly because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of autoloaders or hand scanners.
Share participants, on Friday, demanded a salary increase and sat down to see that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker getting $9.5 per hour, that's not the cost of the pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it costs $3.2 billion to the corporation.
It's about 1.1 percent more than she's spent on the salary now.
If Walmart is able to translate the increase in wages to customers, then every visit to the store will cost him only 46 cents more.
In a year, they're going to spend some $12.39 more than they're going to spend now.
Walmart supporters point out quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any minor damage to the corporation.
The black Friday continued at its shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made nearly 100 million transactions on the June Friday.
A representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview with the left of the Huffington Post, that the jobs had been abandoned to a total of less than five Walmart employees, and that the protest was merely a regular pioneer trick of organizing its trade union.
- Free cashier -
Protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart University (they are not complained about in this progressive city, and therefore they are not yet here), and Macdonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick people or pay you for an honest job!
Juméne Williams, member of the New York City high school
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants raise it over time, but not at all, and on average, they receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
There's no one making them in this expensive town.
How can you exist in New York for that kind of money, for me, it's inconceivable.
Sometime through the Macdonalds, almost a quarter of the American teenagers who took care of their stalls after school lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly try to interview McDonalds, who complain they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal Forum, a commentator observes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them on.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday, McDonalds, on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast food system pay at least $15 an hour, that is, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing the activists of the trade union movement from doing so in the form of dormitory and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to reach fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Incontroverted
Noise protests took place on that day and at several other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The roundup of the action was in the middle of the afternoon of the U.S. MacDonalds rally -- next to Times Square, which featured several local Democrat politicians, including a member of high school, Jumén Williams, who said, \"Macdonalds\" says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick people and he doesn't pay you to do honest work.\"
Demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the Bill De Blacio Mayor, who stated that “we must be friendly in supporting the quick-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that each New York City deserves”.
As the New York Times described, it was the largest act of this kind in the history of the American area of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were fast-paced workers, with tens of thousands of people busy in New York City.
It's not yet clear whether this glass will produce the flame of mass movement.
- While the brain is being fooled, it's getting average.
A popular theme among advocates of modern technology has recently been adopted largely through the lens of special points.
In the summer of its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed the patent.
However, a conversation with the team leader of the interactive 3D technology team at Microsoft Sharm Isadi's Cambridge Laboratory shows that for the scientists in the company, the point is the stage.
Their manipulation perspective by virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what is your research group doing?
- We're interacting with machines, but we're trying to spread out the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in the mass was stuck on a flat screen while working with pixels, sometimes the tics in them are stuck with their finger.
We want to look at five to ten years ahead and think about the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox app and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without the Kinect, because it's all very interesting to be a gesture.
- What else are we waiting for?
- Although Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has improved (the system receives more data) and output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, making it more tangible.
To do this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around the user.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And above all, to hell with the stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular thing, but do they overvalue it?
- He's definitely not a panacea - he's a privacy question because he doesn't always want to tell people about his actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everybody's in their own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not things that were mindy, but those that were so steep, so short.
However, the gestures were not removed by a camera of the device but by a hand-held bracelet that fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
While it's large, it can theoretically be reduced to hours of office.
But the future is behind a mixed type of government, like a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this bank of gas?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognize.
So you want to make users adapt to what a machine can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual convergence.
I think we will need to work in the near future to develop new types of sensors that will allow us to define more accurately the human response.
It could be laser sensors, for example, they're giving good depth resolution, that's very important.
- When you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims for modern cameras?
There's not enough permission, depth or anything?
In principle, the current generation is something that we can look back on in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1,000 kc/s.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies for us are not good enough -- they add to the design of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the X-axis and the Y-axis resolution, but Z.
It's also very important speed, number of personnel per second.
The human movement is rather dynamic and the current 30 kc/s is quite low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Biteshes of our Redmond Laboratory made a processing-controlled sensor, from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands the impact that this can have on human and machine interaction.
The equivalent of such a device would be very useful in my work, just not requiring more staff per second.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras - one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is an reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular visual range sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the amount of calculation required.
It would be good to create a flexible analogy to the Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help in a three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- I remember Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his points to the public.
Don't you think it's one of the most promising platforms in terms of the everyday use of eye-added technology?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around all the time, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, but that's what I think, the coolst option would be - moving - an enhanced reality, where on the basis of a cloud-based platform you could switch from a smartphone point to a smartphone, a projection display and beyond.
Points are a very personal device, and their power (private things only you see) and at the same time weakness - an augmented reality based on points will prevent you from working on virtual objects with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often criticized for such an idea: There is no tactical reference!
Hands can't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the enhanced reality is the seventh breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be a little bit more of a tactile sensation.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of pad for the image.
She's good at registering the pressure!
But there are also technologies that really aim to make these maps in the air - resiliency - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located, but while it's very weak - as if you were hit by pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also the forward direction.
- Were you trying to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels something he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that before.
Here lies another challenge that has to be fought for a long time -- how to make a person physically in a very limited space, believe that he is going on open, practically endless -- working and the concepts of treadmills (not like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
As long as the brain is deceived by average, work is still very long.
That's what makes working on the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things in a completely start-up state.
A taste instead of culture -- Rosbalt.ru
- Rosbalt - continues the Peterburg Avangard project on citizens who are on the front in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already come to bear the vivid figures of Peterburg's art-wall, whose achievements go beyond the city's borders, often in recognition in Europe, past all-Russian prominence.
The new character, Rosbalt, is an epathy artist named Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, who is a bearded man dressed in all the red, who meets at the Russian Museum, and at the Garden of Summer, and on the fashionable carnage and vernisage.
Cyril Miller's paintings always collect crowds of spectators wherever they are displayed.
Cyril Miller is one of Peterburg's purely socio-philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a brilliant man in the late '80s, the Petersburg vanguard, the early '90s.
He's also a city man with a smile in the streets of the city raising the mood of the city.
Recently, he took a scarf and became a Peterburg slayer because he had developed for this difficult role to play in all his god - fearing existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a view and image model.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, imagemaker and society.
While in society everything that's a little too gray causes aggression and instigation.
But my provocations are about starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize you should be an artist?
- To the Nevsk DC exhibition where my work was shown.
I realized it was my way.
At that time the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free-styles were incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the new wave artists, with the post-Puskin-10 post-Gazon area, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into the theater, clothes, music, all genres except words.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where we have to get all the best creative powers.
In 1995, I took over the territory in Pushkin 10 and there was a music and art club, a God-god club, and a Peterburg-god house.
Many of them were born: Nomas, Tequila-jaz, I remember Schnoura bringing in a project called \"Uho Van Gogha \" .
Schnoor and his friends sang light songs under the fan, and they were in the grip, and there was a fashionable composer, Igor Wdovin.
When the band played alive, she became - Leningrad -
Trachtenberg was the lead of many programs before the Cali-Ghalivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he was a great career, and we had basic education and education.
Gallery-D 137-Gribodes club is an award from Art Clinic.
We've gone out there, our workers and people.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was - The people of our town -
Nominal, year after year, I was called, ended with my culmination.
In the new times, old rules cannot work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in our years, but culture and popularity are shared, and you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is in a recognized manner.
- Many of my paintings are hilarious, and they have a clear sense of urgency and urgency.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, the Russ Museum in the clowns.
Clowns are temporary.
I used to be social, to be like that right now, it's painful and scary.
But the clowns are getting drowsy, tragically taking it off.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by ordering totalitarian change.
Now, the clothes are on the lookout for outside mechanics, not the inner person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by the wearing of clothes.
And recently, we saw you as a city slayer.
I don't want to be.
- Could commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial arts must be careful, tactical, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures is coming.
People used to crash down to the ages, and thegoda liked one another, just like another.
Now it's all broken up into a micro-community, and it's going to be hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a big bum so everyone likes me.
Now you have to think who you're gonna like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stas Mikhaylov comes in thousands!
- He's got pockets coming in, and the sex and social sphere is working on.
And on the cultural ground, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and after all, less management, less money, all of them.
I've got the fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil the profit.
I used to write these paintings when I was a young man, that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larion's tower.
I started with pictures that usually end.
There's a lot of confusion now.
They say: culture is spiritual, consumption culture.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a cultural man of yesterday, and I grew up as an example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint pictures.
I'm for a culture like this.
- Kirill, what's missing Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: a cultural official.
But not everyone can do culture.
The kings may not have done so, the kings may not have understood much about culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're pushed, because we need higher experts to evaluate these experts correctly and give them the opportunity.
It's a delicious place to flourish.
It's the same Erarta, but what makes them very different is that they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's wrong with you, Petersburg?
- Peterburg isn't a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil there.
And it's hard to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than our readers, which is wrong.
There's a lot of people who are curious in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinning.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was in the early part of the last century.
Project implemented by the St. Petersburg grant
Born Into Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with asteroid killer.
Carved spaceships with earths on board are being sent to search for a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the key question is, How can we continue with our race in a climate of unbridledness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be read at least hypothetically.
- This is Venus and Mars, a senior scientist at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions are better for life on Mars, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
We can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in outer space.
Approaching the questions of reproduction in space began with flora.
Even half a century ago, plants were experimented with.
The four generations of peas produced in orbit were nothing different from their earthly varieties.
Then, in orbiting insects, the tiny fruit flies Drosophile.
In 1979 an egg of quail was sent to space to verify the development of the embryo in a climate of unbridledness.
We get a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
And then the problem begins.
The problem of finding resistance to the bat, having to stand on its feet and start moving - explains R. Vladimir Sichev, a laboratory leader of the Institute of Medical and Biological Affairs (IMBP).
Without any resistance, the birds wandered indiscriminately.
After 10 hours, the newborn had a full atrophy of instincts.
They didn't react to the light and the sound.
And the trouble there was that after four days, they were just dying.
- And twice we hatched the birds, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them - it's a failed experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sychev.
The last time that animals were in orbit, the bio-minicheg flew 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, the Biosatellite Biosatellite, Beon, will have only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural.
- It was just on biosatellites, but again, it's a single experiment, and you have to do it - it's noted Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
This is not an easy task.
The animal, the lost, the habit of living, simply cannot carry out its sexual instinct.
A man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract mind, and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
There are no such experiments for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
Tereshkov had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a woman's organism.
Our Teak has gone, and no one on Earth could say whether it will be preserved after it has made its flight into space.
Does she miss giving birth to a baby after that flight?
“No one has answered this question,” says Vachtang Wachtovdze, a veteran of the missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight to space, Valentin Tereshkov's first cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nicolaus was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsky, the second cosmonaut, was born twice in orbit and even in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have very little cosmonauts, and after a long flight, we have a whole lot of them, and we have a healthy generation.
- And if more, it's dangerous even in orbit flights - it's a cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia Valery Polakov.
Still, there is a need for humanity to look for new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CDC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here in a zero-floating environment, astronauts develop open-space skills.
The water simulates incongruity.
If for adults the water is comfortable and comfortable, but it's still a foreign environment, then it's a natural element for the babies.
It's like little citters confirm that life on land has gone out of the ocean.
There's a connection between having a baby in a water bottle for about nine months and getting used to the water.
In principle, this is logical because it only takes two weeks from the moment of birth, the moment of the first bath.
- It's very little to forget something - it's the instructor of Marin Axenov's thorax.
In the words, if a more natural condition is necessary for a born child to have a bad birth, she needs gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly, the muscles of the abdomen drowsy in ignorance, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus down.
All right, let's go down, and that's to rely on birth stimulants.
You can, of course, go to childbirth in a special cell, push it out.
- And then - - - asks uncontrollable questions to Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training load suit.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs.
- And this experiment that we're going to go to, allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled, completely de-adapted person - will be anticipated by the head of the Bioethics Committee of IMBP RA Igor Pestov.
While the birth of children in space is a theory question.
However, this will be a reality when earthers on their ships travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief, Audit and Control Office: Checks of the Schwartz system have been broken down by the guilt of politicians.
The Czech Republic has good controls in the public procurement sector and, despite the existence of good quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
- The law will never be perfect, but it should be the right thing to apply, which I think we do not have enough-- commented on Kala's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German monitoring bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is based on Peter's approach.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this banned or allowed?
The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions that are obliged to verify and enforce the obligations - it finds Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you were talking about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on public procurement by both countries was compared.
What was the specific point?
It's about the parallel check that we started, maybe two years ago.
In short, European legislation states how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even if it has not yet been verified, interesting differences have been found -- simply speaking, the legislation may be “exact and infallible” -- but in the practice of applying we are giving Germany on some of the parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project really help you what it means to you?
It is this kind of joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve restrictions because it does not produce a positive result.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be overwhelmed by booms - so that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction were not reduced.
You are talking about domestic problems in implementing legislation on public procurement.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (Review Control) there, or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is the Bundesrenchnungshof, which, in principle, is also a panel that works slightly differently, but basically both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, audit and federal level, the system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only run federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than we do?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be certain that it is better in all things.
That's right, because they're better at controlling them?
I certainly don't, but I repeat, I don't like these comparisons.
But even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how have your institution been affected by amendments to the Public Procurement Act, there have been some manifestations of consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet appeared in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We're only taking this into account in the preparation of future audits, and we're starting to use our new tool -- the risk of inequity -- through which we've run almost 14,000 government contracts -- and we've analysed them, and of course these changes will be made because the constraints change, some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you believe that the adoption of this law would be of benefit or additional burden to the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that rules will get worse, and it will not be possible to comply with them.
In the previous rules, controlled enterprises were linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with a regional board) in that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement constituted a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but do not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently said that the GDP would not bother entrepreneurs with checking the so-called Schwartz system.
- Schwartz system - banned or authorized?
The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibited, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies that were obliged to verify and enforce their obligations.
You might say, \"We're changing this law and we're going to let it -- but we're not saying we're gonna pretend that nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains strict rules, as well as formal rules, and that is correct, and it will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
Roads are slippery, but mostly pass.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but somewhere with more caution.
Kharlovar Region
This morning, roads were passing in the town of Karlovar, but some were frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from 5 to 10 degrees below zero, but during the day it must be slightly warmer.
Snowfall in the region has ceased, only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, the Red Mountains have about a hundred inches [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the local road workers, it was known that the sites were lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and the first-class roads in the region are now in progress without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be biased and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are on track.
But on some of their sites, the remains of frozen and frozen snow remain.
Especially alert are the roads that are on high ground.
Pardubic and Kralovegradec Region
The management of Czech roads and highways on its Internet pages informs us that some eastern Czech roads are threatened by famine, and snow can be seen on mountain roads and high roads.
District road workers warn of a famine, which can occur especially at the heights of the Pardubitz Region.
The gold can be near Lanschkroun, Usti nad-Orlija, Polika, Svitawi or Vishka Mito especially on second- and third-grade roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Swift, are treated with chemicals.
Especially is snow on the roads of Krkonoche and the Orlic Mountains.
Snow is on roads on high ground in the Richnov-over-Knejnoy and Trutnov areas.
In the eastern Czech Republic today, the variable area is free of precipitation.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plsen Region
Roads in the Plzen region are passing this morning, but places need to be kept alert and adapt to the weather.
The temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero in the morning.
After the snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 Shossa is now passing practically unrestricted, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most roads in the first grade have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Tahov and south of Tjeveh, the willful sites may be found.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and there is also a warning to the possibility of sliding areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on few-used roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouts ’ Land
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region should take account of snowflakes on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the red-headed saddle and on the road in the direction of Videl Krshija.
At night, snow was forced into the streets of road workers, according to road control, some three inches [3 cm] of snow fell in Schumperka.
In other areas, roads tend to pass without restriction.
- The snow remains lie on the elevations of Schumperk.
Drivers heading towards Esenique must bear in mind the existence of snowflakes in the Red-horner's saddle, and today the CHAN (Czech News Agency) dispatcher for road control has been reported.
On the night of the clearing of the roads, their colleagues from Esenika also made sure that the roads on the highlands remained naked and wet after treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are passing without restriction, but in Sternberk, drivers must be aware of forest areas where humidity still persists.
East Country, Libre Land
Road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few difficult places left this morning.
According to the police database, in addition to several sites with holly or snow, a mountain road is closed on a section of Telnica on the Clinice in the Usteck province.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Middle East, there is no problem; roads are mostly dry.
Road complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report a halode in the vicinity of Stetti.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created at night, raining all day and melting snow, and night the sky cleared and freezing began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border of the Ustzek and Librecs.
The snowscraping trees of the road were forced to close the road at Telnica on the Book.
Shimon Ornest: We want positive energy at concerts.
What do you think is that less than a month later the end of the world should come?
That's just one of the many disturbing news stories that we humans are going to get so easily.
Together with The Tap Group, we're constantly joking about this and saying that we're the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give a completely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
It is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the Maya calendar, which was announced at 11:10 p.m. on December 21, at the end of which we decided to use.
The day before that event, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrov will begin in the 20th of December at 8 pm.
They will end up, roughly speaking, at a time when the May calendar will end on Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, a time zone 12 hours earlier than we do.
Who cares about this idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our artist, Gonza Augusta.
Besides our desire to accumulate enough energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world is going to pass on to our children one day.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, has also performed a hymn against the end of the world, which is called the End of the World being reversed.
Would the YouTube audience-loving gimney be heard at these benefis concerts?
Of course, at the very end of the day, if it's all going to work out and the end of the world isn't coming.
All the performers in all the concerts will sing him.
The hymns will also sound on the live air of Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the music video by Tomas Ganak, participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with other personons of Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out many people like to work with us, and they're interested.
What is the benefit of a concert versus the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO barless education centre, for the sixth year, we've been working with the Tap civil association at the Yedlica Institute.
Teachers regularly attend school at the Yedlica Institute and have fun and fun events with them.
Students themselves do not have the resources to go to the teachers, and we are thus trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project to further the construction of the Yedlic Institute, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project in the future.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that interests all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango, and Irji Suhi will speak in Prague.
You can find both details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar gratuitous activities in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Spring Festival of Prague, and we'll be preparing an interesting programme with the guests.
Next year we would be pleased to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally would like to speak in Washington and Chicago, if we are in the United States.
You've had serious plans for the border, and you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the road from the point of view of organization and logistics?
It's not as frightening as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a whole lot of cargo and tools.
Nevertheless, as long as we were able to cope with this, the Czech ÇSA and British airlines of British Airways have always been excellent for us, which has surprised me for so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we've just come back, it's all gone out of trouble.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you been facing to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that we are still at a basic level in the east.
There are many barriers in comparison with Prague in Moscow, and there is still a wild man's autonomous movement on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
There are also banal things out there, such as giving up the road to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, social organizations have already been set up to focus people's attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we always have to catch up with the best countries?
There are so many things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own on the streets, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
It's not very common that a lot of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in which we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barbarity is one thing, but when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really starts to change.
So far these are unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is very popular at present, but we'll be back two years ago, which made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Yedlikka Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm also playing the Saxophone, my colleague and I have an interesting music circle.
Well, in time, as our leading Ladia Angelović says, it's a little out of control.
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
True, we were helped by the fact that we started joining the famous singers and working actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can estimate is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so forth.
Was it that good for you to deploy The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
The show business is full of things that mimic one another.
That makes sense, all the new things are being taken with care, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is pity, it's natural...
But this pity is so great, because people with disabilities are not all the ill and abandoned persons we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a change not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has it been successful that you are a strong leader, whom many think you are?
If we want to do work in a qualitative manner, we must in many things be uncompromising and disciplined.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us romantically and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are twenty members of The Tap Group.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent it.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stage, in Brno at the Fléda and Ostrava Club, in the center of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telecast at the time the song was played by The Tap Tap - The Light End is cancelled.
The aim of this project is to raise 25 million crowns of funds for the purchase of multifunctional non-barrier equipment for the STUDEO education centre at the Yedlica Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age, free of charge, and you can buy tickets in Bohemiaticket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former East bloc (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland had begun its close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had actively participated in a number of agency projects over the years.
But the journey to space was well ahead of Poland.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space missions, but this was not always the case with understanding.
I will recall, for example, A. Sternfeld's lecture, which on 6 December 1933 presented to Warsaw astronomical observatories ideas from his pioneering work - Introduction to cosmonauts -
The ideas of the young engineer (1905 C.E.) left the audience in an inequity, after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky had been interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri's and André Luis Hirsch's Cosmonauts' Award in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great advocate of astronomy and cosmonauts.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote several books on these subjects.
Gadomsky became a prominent world space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the other side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway road equipped with a rocket engine had been built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as the details of the draft.
It was not even clear that a rocket would have to be used to unwind or to brake the calf.
Only from the press of that era is information on this subpoena.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about rocket shots.
The research was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in collaboration with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjitski.
It can be seen from the materials that have been retained that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But as German troops arrived, work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press introduced the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket proposed by engineer Rogozinski, and next year the work, “Torpedo Air Missile and Air Missile Bomb, by Livila Quivobloc, was released.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Before the war, all missile-related military projects were carried out by the Provisional Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific paper on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautical Sciences (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of society is made in the November 1954 issue of the journal - Problems - which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovic proposed the organization of a society that would be involved in cosmonauts.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were being revolutionized, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (PAA) has attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and has become a valid member of the PAA in the autumn.
Next year, the first President of the PAA, Casimen Zarankević (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological RM rocket (Rakieta Meterologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first type was launched on 10 October 1958.
A rocket capable of traveling 1,800 m was about 80 cm in length, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and, in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested on the Bladow Desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do the actual scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could travel 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first type of RM missiles were the Meteor 1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, 510 cm in total length and 32.5 kg initial weight.
Three types (described as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which varied in size for scientific equipment.
The meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 litres, a meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and a meteor-1C of 0.62L.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a meteor-2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The meteor-2 rocket, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was capable of producing a useful weight of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The version of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 was then constructed.
Reference is also made to Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Furthermore, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space explorations on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Germasevsky became second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
Of course, it would be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalized economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, free and unlimited private capital movements, together with unfettered financial speculation.
A significant difference in the cost of labour (employee) results in a price tension.
These concepts need to understand the state that a producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, is trying to maintain in economic competition what it is -- the value of a competitor to take away most of the market and thereby increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means either moving production abroad or cheap purchases abroad or disappearing, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital bore no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the State's inevitable social expenditure was growing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and social damage they have inflicted on them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to produce specific statistics.
Private capital practices have created a situation at the level of economies of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments give their own people over private capital, despite social decline.
This is particularly reflected in changes in existing legislation.
The goal is to make its people subject to the private-capital dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a tool for cutting labour rights.
As a result, poverty levels are increased, but the difference between the poor and the rich is also increased.
The FRG has for several years had a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases in which the employed people receive such wages that the State must pay them a minimum of living.
This scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same state in which people under pressure from a social catastrophe are either forced to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to exist on poverty pay in the backs of society, in the hope that private investment capital will ever arrive.
But ask him where would he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wage.
This is the case in Latin America.
Liberal theory and the mass media have argued to the point that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which results in an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not intervene in the economy.
Further, the question should be answered whether private capital, the current real-life policy manager and the whole State, is not in effect for their own selfish purposes?
A definite answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of practically all-powerful and all-powerful foreheads in all States.
As a result, we have an inconceivable situation of corruption, of ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation where virtually everything deserves to be punished but is not a crime.
In the FWG, the situation is such that public ministries, owing to lack of financial resources, are entrusted with the drafting of bills to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills then approve the Bundestag.
All power is derived not from the people, as the Western Constitution stipulates, but from the financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberalized democracy is now rapidly becoming a reality, as described by Appian in the work “Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar and Pompey’s Day”. The State has long been falling apart and the authorities are engaged in violence.
Thieves, illegally receiving favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to the election with a pre-sold vote -- \"...the orderly people didn't run for the office of ruler at all, after all, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months \" . \"It was serious to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-restraint and the need for a choice of a vigorous man -- and Appian thought that it would be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had completely changed democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, today ' s society is dominated by its own reckless interests, without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for social purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to undertake deeper-seated reforms.
Thus, the reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is that we should look for 19 and 20 centuries of reckless liberalization of economic systems.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, followed by the next round.
Above all, it is tragic that the present elite has completely ignored the consequences of hundreds of thousands of casualties in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Work Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
The trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s equity in the economy, enhance the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
- Out of violence, nothing comes out, and can never come out. - Sting, song \"Frequency\" where the main poem of the refren is: \"Don't forget how fragile we are.\"
If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be dead Gutel Schnapper, Meer Amschel Rothschild's wife.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many responses.
Some favour Israel in arguing its position that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by arguing with the racism of the State of Israel, by the genocide committed over Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel attributes the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurring waves of murder, is the offender, and who is the victim, in the end, of today's Israeli citizens, including the self-governed territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who is first served by the 95 years of tension (based on the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) at a small section of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who, or which group of people, is the main engine of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all a history of power struggle.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards the intended goals.
We should be allowed to live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that the concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have occurred for a single generation.
Among the astronomicalally rich families is one that could be regarded as a head of spontaneity (I don't know if someone's over them, but it's not excluded) by Rothschild.
They don't have much to say about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reiters) in the 1990s in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their names to criminal acts in the higher spheres in whose shadows they were, and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have large stock packages in almost all of the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they wage or prepare war (there were only 7 countries prior to the invasion of Afghanistan, 5 countries since the invasion of Iraq, only four after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its own country into its own hands).
Anyone trying to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rotschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own money (understand government) and was murdered in 1865 in theatre.
John F. Kennedy started producing his own money and wanted to cancel FED (Federal Reserve System) was killed in 1963, and the MP, Luis McFadden, was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power from 1859 until 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great Freemason of the 33rd level by Albert Pike.
The objective of the first war was to destroy the monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), a single universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of wealthiest families, led by Rotschilds, works is a challenge to the crisis and a subsequent proposal for solutions (order ab chao - chaos order).
But these solutions are false and have always led to a deterioration of the situation (see the case of FED, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they had succeeded in unleashing the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they had destroyed the Royal Russia by launching a major revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unsubstantiated surrender of Germany (no war was needed to destroy the royal Russia) and, consequently, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the lunches, then only to give the Germans a strong enough one to hold the guilty and offer simple solutions to the Chief, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play a role in the fifth column, in fuelling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild provoked a Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration established a prerequisite for mass Jewish immigration to Palestine, beginning the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or what he had done, was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for a Jewish State to be recognized by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was declared to be in the midst of war III.
If international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, like the Second World War, would be the victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only at the domestic level but also at the international level (only to have a sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is guilty, and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the wrong is causing resentment in an endless chain of violence when it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish ordinary Israeli people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are subsidizing people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal politician, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of all the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: \"All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order\"
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth implants a chip with which it becomes a species under total control.
“And cause all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have the right hand or the forehead glue, so that the man who is not marked by the name of the beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: Everyone with intelligence can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Film Operation Argo - When it's worse nowhere, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonstrators took over the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overstretched shaha Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, who had fled the U.S. Revolution, who had been the protector of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it could have fundamentally undermined the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not in a position to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations under the mediation of the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film by actor Ben Affleck, Operation Argo, describes one of the episodes of history that America has won.
Shortly before the Embassy's occupation, six workers were able to escape.
After difficult peripathies, they finished their journey to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them from Iran, and helped with the extravagant cover story that they had gone through Canadian passports as members of a survey group looking for a science-fiction survey site in the country.
Cohesion of genres
The plan that the evacuation expert, Tony Méndez, came up with required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the story credible, specialized magazines wrote about the draft film, held a press conference, and a fancy manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Méndez.
Affleka film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called film cinematope, the story of a good set, the affair could be a series of Aushen's friends movies.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the stage of presentation from Tehran (in titras, there are famous historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there is no big difference in it).
On the other hand, facilitated Hollywood passages that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then other scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, men in costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek has had a remarkable career start-up.
The mock actor became a respected director, and his game stopped being ridiculed.
Operation Argo is his third full-blown film, after the dark detective - Good-bye, baby, farewell - (2007) and the miller - City (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film not filmed in the town of Director, Boston.
The atmosphere of the site is related to the qualities that raised earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck's doing it in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of the confusion and unpredictability that arise when history changes somewhere suddenly.
Affleck and his colleagues have a remarkable effect in the scenes of the fictional (subpartial headquarters on the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the message did not imply many of the exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's quite successful in working with this a little bit, and sometimes he thinks it's not so elegant out there (the scene of a phone call in America averts the impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the chase on the airstrip looks pretty smart).
A disadvantage - Argo - is the scattering need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are truly promising, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not alone in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro-style that re-establishes the trillions of the seventies.
But it's hard.
Yet this is enough to remind one, still in the known sense of living history, as well as to show how the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are exaggerated.
Air balloon, banana and circus overhead rules
Portal www.bankovniplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for the most absurd order or project from the EU workshops.
We have seen this recent development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” stated the Right to Organize Professor Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already mentioned is the recent decision of the European Court to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance because they are objectively less exposed to risk for insurance companies.
The remaining incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people to compete before the end of this year.
The vote itself would take place before the end of February 2013,” said Nager.
Disputed EU orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the prohibition of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain relatively few hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which has resulted in the substantial travel of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term \" Butterfruit oil \" , or removal from the sale of classic lamps, was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm long.
The Pan-European apparatus often decides, under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is now even under threat of veto).
The interests of the forehead are: for example, high quality bananas in the EU were to reach a length of 14 cm and have no courage to show an - anomalous curvature -
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by harmonizing existing disparate national regulations that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has mitigated the standards of fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives would lead to the waste of products.
Last year’s EU regulation, which requires air balloons sold to warn that children under eight years of age are not able to inflate them without the care of adults, could also be a candidate for the interview.
The EU has referred to American studies according to which air balloons, when played, are the potential cause of death by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are forbidden to wear fair-year-olds.
Fun ideas are also born at home
The rule concerning European officials itself is absurd enough: anyone with an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitive nature of the theme for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and instead say “BYRM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com Portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists - The Principle of Non-interference - (Laissez Faire), has proposed to vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a member State.
The EU has established a maximum supply of food that may be available in the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic had subsequently exceeded, for example, the established amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a large fine.
The questionnaire's organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and in providing grants for applications for grants.
But those ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
- We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
To ask the European Union for compensation, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CHSDP) said in autumn 2004.
He argued that there was a high crop of grain in the country and that, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the State had had a full stock stock stock that had to be removed.
For the fact that Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palas, was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met with the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the grant were offered by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by the Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, to apply for grants from Brussels.
EU: Harmful orders are the exception
Although the rulings in Member States were easily criticized, the EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts felt that recognition should be more welcome.
The experts felt that the drawing of EU grants for projects that had no indication of anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States had achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It is an emotion among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win the competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name \"Olomautsuks \" , but \"Tuzem rum \" , whose traditions are rooted in the 19th century in our country, our producers were to be renamed \"Tuzek \" .
The name rum can be referred to only as a cane of distillate rather than a sugary candle.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world's well-known feta- and-horgondsola-Marcipan from German Lübeck or Parmesan, has already turned out to be, for example, the Carlavarian Drys, the Gorgeon and the Tribebon Carp, and the Jacquean hop.
The EU trademark may also be proud of the Pardubic pinnacle and the mustard tubs.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to mind to run for president?
I don't think of becoming a senator or a president.
If we had everything in the country that was working without a problem, I wouldn't have run anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been breaking up over the past 20 years, like thieves, people get taxed and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things except for running for senator or president.
You're in the Senate, but you're soon on your way to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your backs on the people who chose you?
I've always said I'm going to go into the fight for presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later explained that if I were elected senator, I would be running for president.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument through which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and wide powers.
But the difficulty is not just that we're like a nation cutting into a bar or a TV, but we're willing to drown anyone who's going to try to change something.
This is added to the media, which blacken a person and lead to freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was making bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroobek.
Let's get to your point of view.
You have begun the fight for presidential castle with claims of political material and criminal responsibility and back-to-back property declarations above 20 million.
To do so, the law must be amended.
You do not have such powers as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I was a citizen lobbying to take the guided tour to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics, when someone comes with a good offer on the left or the right, they deliberately act as obstacles, and that deters citizens.
As an independent, partisan person, I have a much greater potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I'm unparticipated, without looking at dogmas, can take from each party what's best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a human being than one of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that my people refer more to my left.
It doesn't matter to me a little bit to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not that someone's right, but someone's left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any decision that is good for society whether to propose it to the HREOC or to the HDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're populist.
But are you proving this by what you said?
When you make a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
You could call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or they're being talked about by eminent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have slogans.
And it won't take you a long time in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
It is only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public to try to lure them to our side so that we can succeed.
If I had been elected President, there would have been no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there were to be a strong personality that would speak out of abuse, pressure could be put on the political scene.
Taking the President's direct election was a matter of public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm a fan, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to find allies in order to stand up to my beliefs and views.
I'm only starting out in politics, and for my programme, I'm going to try to get most of my support.
I am trying to move on my own, and if that fails, I will be finished six years later and return to the private sector.
In part, it sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people offering to run for the Senate.
I went to the Jancure Radna, and he refused to do much work.
I also supported at least a leading investigation by journalist Jan Laurentsov, who discovered a fraud with light fuel products.
I've put forward my candidacy because people are truly dissatisfied, but now I feel at the weight.
Sixty per cent of the people didn't go to the elections, and most of those who went chose to leave.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that it would not be easy to change.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought of it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do that.
No money, no presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of art of about 10 million, an Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and a superb school of $1 million, and a few million more.
By the way, aston-Martin came out, because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, he was galantine with women, and at the same time, he was struggling against underage and lawlessness.
Do you drive to Aston Martin, own 60 million property, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in that.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors indicates that my program isn't so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign would actually cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't have lived on that money, for example, I couldn't have paid my son for an English school worth 30,000 months.
If only I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to cut it down?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a freelancer who will keep the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much are you used to getting as an entrepreneur?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get to the next.
And if I were to become president, I'd end my entrepreneurship.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's newspaper, Right.
MVRDV architects prove that the actual adventures are not only in the imagination - like Speykenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
\"I think this building looks fun, it looks futuristic, and we're finally going to see something interesting again,\" says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a large business nearby, says: \"No, this building is really beautiful.\"
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
All have the Internet, the iPad and e-books.
Nobody's ever been willing to go to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Speykenniss, the little sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 is the lowest in education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted iron-bobeton miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only way they could get statistics: build a library here!
Maas of the MVRDV Rotterdam Architecture Office, a master of bold column diagrams and an acute, sometimes cynical, writer, took a task with his usual incompetence and appeared in a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under a mouse and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked back and shook its shoulders, the obstinate Maas composed of his original pyramid - size gift and completed his defense of the draft with the following words:
Here it is, my suggestion: \"The Book Mountain is in Speykennissa, the so-called Boukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, has grown.
It is part of a rehabilitation project, which also includes underground garages, supermarkets, mail and several adjacent dwellings and taunhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November - Book Mountain - the second competition prize was awarded - The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012 -
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national village plant competition.
Thus, the nameless suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything other than the post-modern pedestrian area and the amazingly unbelievable town hall, whose white façads led to the idea of a milk factory, became richer in one modern architecture.
But most importantly, Speykenniss was the first cultural building in the city's history.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado book under cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because real architects of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area by foot.
The room that is baked on all sides is light and easily visionary, hollowed - out bricks and elegant streetlights can safely create a sense of public area.
The urban environment has been recreated perfectly.
Look at the benches, dogs, and playing football boys and girls.
Books, books, books, books.
“ The bookshelves usually stand along fronts, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually uninhabitable and unintelligible, ” says Vini Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on the head and pulled the area to read from inside the outside.
The interior of the book’s mountain is skillful: offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities are located in the centre.
Black book bands, which serve as a section of the wall, are especially enjoyed by the parapets, the stairs.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesswork, what this is about.
“We sought to work with secondary materials” explains Jope Trauborst, the project leader representing the community of Speykennissé, as required by the standard.
And once in one agricultural enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial, fibrous, millimetre - thick material has been used as a base.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this is a canvas -- for the first time in such volumes -- that was sprayed in a four - inch - thick panel.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplasty (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, durable material, a smell a little like a new car and a little bit of cross-section.
105 steps to the top.
Those who travel almost 500 metres in length will be rewarded with a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden ficus in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, especially the right humidity on the literary mountain.
New soul costs
“It is hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model green project” says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used to warm it and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even in the clear days of the sun, it will only take a short time to get inside.
Large adhesive wood farms that are perpendicular to the glass facade give shade and take over most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The remaining protections are provided with fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, had already visited a library in the area of IT.
Lisette Verhaig has already been here.
And a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Boukenberg the soul of Speykennisse, who had long been short -
Reason: A few weeks before opening, each resident was invited to contribute a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take up empty spaces on the shelves of a library of 70,000 books at the time.
The idea worked.
The shelves are on top.
- It's nothing worse than a semi-empty library - says architect Wini Maas.
- I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant is somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
The MVRDV thus succeeded in solving a royal task called identity creation on the professional jargon.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for identity building.
Sabo: - The Germans have to play a more important role -
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, this is the way Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against a Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why not?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support it either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the imposition of a no-flight zone.
As a result, NATO made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy that the United States has, so to its German foreign policy.
Further, the situation is complicated by the lack of coherent policy among Europeans.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they're only faking their part, they're on the way to a more normal, foreign policy.
Foreign policy, which is pursued by France or Britain.
What, then, does it mean, as a matter of fact, is foreign policy from a German point of view?
This is a commitment to take a position that is independent of the US or European partners in their national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ greatly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets for marketing in the Middle East, particularly in the States of the Persian Gulf.
It therefore needed to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral bond.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by holding back important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that the understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the United States.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as it was on the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that she should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that she should be treated with her interest.
There are diverse views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly expressed.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in the context of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as ever.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not a fan of Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes a situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat simpler if there were a single, uncontroversial European policy, but now it's not.
They are therefore unable to take a broader approach and are forced to act instead with only their own vision of the situation.
That's how they do it with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
Clearly, this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
The subject was always sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have a more independent role to play.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, will it really play a central role?
Or is it still hard for Germany to take the lead?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still has a difficult role to play.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
The Germans don't just handle it.
In fact, it's an old problem: You don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much heavier situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, who is left?
The Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, you don't like it, you don't like it, or you're going to make you feel like it.

Protection of trademarks - in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely official name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have sued.
It is not clear, though, whether they will be able to stand up for their rights.
Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney for Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk, every week is about a new matter of this kind.
It is enough for simulators to add a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So, from Gucci, we get Lu-Gucci, and we can register Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
German enterprises, such as the producer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied in the same way.
Pattloch opens up a folder with records from the Beijing Trademark Registration Department.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used by the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese are champions of the world for copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
Large cities have multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloch ' s cases are not the same: he is instructed by his trustees that Chinese enterprises should have the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it the ban a mingai is the brand-passenger.
This word is associated with the s-ban dakuan--
That's what women are called after rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept the blame
- It's damaging business, it's something to be fought for - it's Pattloch's belief.
The mark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image is suffering very much
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA, China, with a sales rate of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, it is difficult to remove questionable records in the Trademark Registry, and it is expensive.
The process may last up to nine years, with unclear results.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long period of time, the name became the reality of the market.
If the claimant fails, he will even have to pay the plaguist because he has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphic element cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with Sunny, a construction machine manufacturer, who had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete-producing firm.
So the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The purchased Volvo company Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste, a fashion producer, lost his Chinese simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with a famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The authority for the registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties owing to the lack of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was - back from the emergency in the working process to the norm -
For example, the number of outstanding defence cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending production in the department.
Coping With It Is Precious
As often as in China, numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million declarations for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This record indicates that China has, for the tenth consecutive time, led a list of new registers worldwide, reported to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is far more challenged than ever, as the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the contractor has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to see that their illicit manufacture of counterfeit car parts had been eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a failure of its own because the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, president of the Freudenberg Board of Chemistry in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Department rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the next few institutions, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight.
You need to be in the face.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, \"The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nervousness away from us.\"
Domestic costs are hardly recorded, and the firm's archives have even had to look through acts of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered to the opposing party - a larger six-digit euro - for a settlement.
- Well, it's clear how expensive we should be. - He says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to shift even to Europe.
It is when simulators register unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert has long ceased production in these areas, but it has been able, despite this, to prevent registration.
- We're gonna have to look like that. - He says, Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should - all that is worth defending, registering also in China - says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it may cost much more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party a licence fee for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day — Pulling, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi is practicing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
History of relations that have traveled more than 8,733 kilometres.
First the sinking takes place: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats, and men's tablets pick up and find a tactile in the fence floor.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the alt, bass, tenor, and soprano increase slowly, and they come, charming and following each other.
And Fith Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he drives them with flexible and clear gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Chore Imbongi is practicing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a person's genetics to a palace, attended the rehearsal.
The Om-Obani is not an easy thing, every voice of the choir has its own text in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programmes, there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esiteni, the Voices for Africa team found chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend school for further training.
Within 15 or 20 euros a month, the bossy can be taken over.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot meal at Gogo-Centre.
Imbongs in Zulu means speaker or praiser.
They don't say Bantu in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been teaching songs in this soft language, and from time to time, it even brings them back to where they first appeared — southern Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometres of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitheni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Infected forty per cent
There are about 2,000 people, some still living in simple clay and straw huts, and many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HIV virus.
In Esitieni, the miniature reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF data.
The severe flesh of men, which clearly reduces the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the population in Swaziland is the immunodeficiency virus, death on the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
Horus opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but earlier, Imbomini participants saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care but also simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants, a few euros a year, to send the child to school and to enable him to receive hot food every day.
But a year later, the choir formed a network called Voices for Africa, which has been almost professional in caring for AIDS orphans in Esitgen since then.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial PIPs include syphilis, chlamydiasis, and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilla virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viruses.
Lobic pediculos and scabies are parasitic PIPs.
What are the major impact groups?
Siphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany are due to sexual intercourse between men.
Heterosexual adults are often sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidosis (grid), gonorrhea and the human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are in this group.
The incidence of chlamydic infections among young people is significantly higher than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections afflict young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis morbidity, according to Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth smaller than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may result in ulcers in the field of genitals, complaints in the area of urination, discharge, lower stomach pain, bubbles or in the area of ingestion.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unheard of.
How can we protect ourselves?
The condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In fact, some sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of frequent sexual partner shifts.
In early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and remote effects avoided.
The bosses, the donations, and not least the fees for the choir's performances across Germany, are able to collect something.
“ We’ve all sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgen, ” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Códou Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman, is administered by German money.
She also cares for orphans to be well - arranged, such as one of their grandparents.
Gogos, as we call it on Zulu old women, is the stronghold of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, have given them a roof over their heads, and care for children in shape to appear in class every day.
Those who do not have family members go to the shelter of Haniyasil, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as do the two sparings that prepare for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and co-sponsored with the U.S. Health Organization, PSI conducted HIV testing for many residents of the village.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers deep silence.
A King With 14 Women
- AIDS is an absolute taboo - - says Annette Lennartz, - because it's sexually related -
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-mandated lifestyle also bears the blame for the rapid spread of the ICD virus in previous years.
But it is also the home of stray workers who spread the country’s virus.
Free condoms are on literally every corner, says Annette Lennartz, \"but they're hardly used.
Another culture - flesh to flesh -
To support cultural exchange a little, the choir of Ibmomini travels in southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, combat spirit, confidence and black consciousness, which many on the southern side of the black continent have known since apartheid.
The white bus, which sings black songs, not only brings good mood and joy, but even has caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The visit also always leads to Esitgen, where singers visit undershepherded children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulweni Valley.
\"Go to Esiten, there is light.\" People of the world say.
And after a flight of 8733 kilometres back to Heidelberg, when the pitchers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here as well.
NASA opens ice on Mercury
Zond-Messenger found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The icy cover may be as thick as six feet [20 m] thick.
NASA’s space agency has proved ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
Zond-Messenger found evidence that the world's region is covered by ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, possibly up to 20 meters.
The water is supposed to come from a comet or possibly an asteroid that has been encountered by Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, says probe scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury may be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks have gone elsewhere in the solar system.
Scientists, telescopes and small-scale robots, such as Phoenix, are not visible to earth’s inhabitants to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they will send images to Earth, with small windows in endless abundance.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cerere.
Like Pluto, who refers to the Sun beyond Neptune, Cereer, according to the new definition of the 2006 international astronomical union, is not a planet
This fragment of the telescope's infrared image, Spitzer, represents a “family portrait of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue, more difficult to identify in the star circle of pink - born - stars.
This starry region - scientists call it abnormally W5 - opened by Telescope Spitzer - in the constellation Cassiopeya, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This spilled heat of a dying star photographed the NASA-Spitzer telescope
Looks like the doughnut ring consists of the material that the star threw out during the dying process.
The giant Trifid Nebula, far away from Earth for 4,500 light years, produces new stars from gas and dust.
NASA-Spitzer telescope took this picture of a galactic maternity room.
The star cluster of the Pleiade, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the color is better.
How the red eye groves the sighting of the Street Nebula on this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Water.
Facing the Earth's Continent was this nickname nebula - North America -
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides a sharp color conveyor.
This new star in all beauty was photographed only with telescope infrared sensors - Spitzer -
Saturn and its ring: How they originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
These are probably fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the telescope, Hubble, is the galaxy of the Watergate.
Depending on the color renderings, the images of the spiral galaxies are turned into real works of art.
The photograph published by the European South Observatory shows the remote trifid nebula of the Sagittarius Sagittarius several thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-headed, three-divided), as the dark bands of dust divide into three parts of the heart of the stars.
At the star of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the predictor of a space collision: at 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the core of the two fusion galaxies are facing each other and will inevitably collide.
This birth of the Hubble star took off in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Someone who doesn't like the technical cuts can call it \"The Southern Courtesy Wheel.\"
The HST photo shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is far away by 1,400 light years, consists of dust particles 10 to 100 times smaller than normal house dust.
This image was drawn from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273, took a picture for NASA of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This star nebula has the brightest group of new stars on our Milky Way.
Starships keep creating new stars.
It is a star cloud connected to the Rosette Nebula, also constantly creating new stars, 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
There's no dust in this brightly glowing galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang when hydrogen was mainly present in the universe.
Our views in the universe: critical telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have grown more and the space available to them has become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the largest telescope in the world at Palomar Observatory, San Diego.
The mirror shown here was five feet in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., established the “Big Biocular Telescope”
It allows us to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
“The company of Telescopyo Canarias” has a giant internal device - the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror, the largest South African telescope, is segmented in South Africa to reduce value.
Nevertheless, it is about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of low-cost design performance: a telescope is rigidly fixed to a vertical angle - limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope also has a fixed vertical angle in Texas.
Its particularity: high light collecting capacity.
It is reaching - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world ' s largest telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope is 305 metres in diameter.
By participating in the Outland Mind Search (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
The view for the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a very large telescope here that is fully in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be lit in the visual tube.
In the Chilean ESO Observatory it is also planned to install a European - Very Large Telescope -
Its main mirror should be placed 42 metres - and will be made of almost 1,000 mirrors.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, the two telescopes Keck, on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea, were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 meters in diameter.
Telescopes Kek are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, together with them, also looks into the sky through the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a thirty-metre diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can enjoy the illustrations.
However, the most important types from space supply the Hubble Space Telescope -
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for planets outside the solar system, particularly those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo captures the latest preparations for the Space Telescope - Kepler -
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to outer space no earlier than 2018 on board a missile - Ariane 5 -
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is that it should look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe there's ice on Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, since Messenger is moving closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger probe, the first one that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now convinced of it.
Drink butter every day and live until you are 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible-based age of dignity.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible-based age of dignity.
There is even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem to be relatively young.
A trip across the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A microbus with a thunderbolt runs along an outlandish road past densely forested hills, stormy tales, and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
There are plates, one of the Caucasus people, who is not well known about it, unless they speak very well of Farsi and Azerbaijani and are long-lasting.
Léric is the final point.
The small town is teeming with an overly heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here; the road from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too weary.
It takes eight hours to take 323 kilometres because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea is here in the province until it reaches its destination.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is more to the interest of tourists in Lérica.
“In May Baku was praised by the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the world’s oldest people,” says Fatlueva.
She's the director of the Longitude Museum, probably the only one in the world.
It documents a biography of about eight dozen lower places, over 100 years old, and points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child
But the museum's controversial star is the Charali Müslumov Chaban, who was allegedly 168 years old.
No birth certificate, however.
In view of the fact that the oldest person whose age was confirmed by the documents was 122 years old, the age of Müsslumov seemed extremely doubtful.
He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973, explains Fatulayev.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and he was allegedly born to a daughter at 136 years of age.
So did the Chaban of Mousslums add a couple of decades to their age?
Even Rembrandt Scholtz, a researcher at Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
“Accordingly many people of advanced age can also be found in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan” says Scholtz, “Sardinia is also home to an extremely large number of very old people —
However, there was no scientific evidence of age due to the lack of documentation, since there were no civil registers.
A glass of melted butter every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Léric area often reach the age of a Bible.
Twenty people are now living here over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many longmen here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadé explains this with its special genes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulayev Museum believes the matter of food.
Toys like meat, bread, and most dairy products, many drink on a glass of melted butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary standpoint.
Or is it the original way of life that preserves youth?
At 97 years of age, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on a floor with a barrel of butter that's not getting tired.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two babies are also jumping nearby.
In the kitchen, the guests have tea prepared, which is served in typical pusted glass.
In Mirzaewa, the white teeth are perfectly flat and firm, and under her head she hides the long, dark-and-rural bones that her son proudly reveals to us.
I'm always my milk hair, so they never fell out and kept the color.
- And I've never used shampoo. - says Mirzaeva.
Monthly Retirement for Life
She always ate only what she grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought any food at the store in my life.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
Hardest was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the beloved father, Gaidar Aliyev, got up at the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, which is ruled by the country as dictator, has little or no border in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son, Ilham, was later taken over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elderly people.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension for local conditions, which is the amount for which he can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaewa’s long-time son is also right: “The articles in our culture enjoy deep respect...
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
No reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word “human rights” is absent from the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal a profound rift in the country.
A future sharia-based constitution met with bitter resistance.
The Egyptian president didn't buy a paphos.
We have to create a transition.
“ And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to the god,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but primarily to Christian cops, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the lost opposition, are fearful.
Fear of a religious State on the Nile for the mercy of the powerful - Muslim Brothers -
Mohammed Mursey, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily curtailed the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence to save the revolution -
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree from the University of South California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of force?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be dragged into the night by a 15-hour jump with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, which is a part of the concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings are based on the principles of Islamic law.
But what do you mean by Principles?
This has been and remains to be an interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use vague language and its associated legal luft to interpret the sharia more strictly.
At least this is implied in one of the following articles: in all sharia-related cases, the Al-Ashar University Council, the country's most important Islamic institution, with a high degree of authority in all Sunni Islam.
It should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversaw the law, which would de facto result in the restriction of the judiciary.
There is much interpretation of the draft Constitution
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court must be maintained.
These courts during the Mubarak period served to suppress the opposition.
Since the dictator's overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians have been detained in the military.
Also, as the draft stated, the State must protect the true nature of the Egyptian family - and to uphold its morals and values -
Legally, this has been so vague that government agencies will be able to control even cinema and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article expressly establishes equality between men and women.
Yet another is forbidden to insult and insult the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what such insults and how they should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that there is no - desecration of persons -
Will there be enough cartoons on the president or jokes about law enforcement?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in the draft, which Mursey proposed for signature and which he said would very soon be submitted to the Egyptian referendum.
♪ The revolution came back ♪
For weeks now, opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual consensus on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution came back, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third seat in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the international Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was a place for a scrap of history -
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Mursey of wanting to lead a Putch against Democracy --
- If he declares a referendum, we'll go to his palace and drop it,” said oppositionr Jasser Said.
“We have not yet become tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been blotted out” quoted by the Egyptian media as an opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
-Coran - our constitution -
The well-organized Muslim Brothers called, in turn, for a contrary demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other side of the Nile before Cairo University.
It involved a large number of women under the guises and followers of the Salafi who shouted: \"The people demand the application of the law of God.
They demanded of Mursey: \"clear the country and assure us: 'Coran is our constitution,
The struggle for power over the symbolic area in which it all began provoked the state of almost civil war.
The Mursey followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim brother stated that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had expressed themselves in a loud and clear manner.
Now the time has come to give the people a solution to the electoral urn in which the country should go.
The majority for the Islamic project is considered a settled case.
- The notion of human rights is never mentioned -
Hafiz Abu Saed was angry at this spirited constitutional process, which was actually to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EORP) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or tried at Mubarak.
Not because he shared their outlook, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words \"human rights\" are never seen in the new Constitution, and he regrets talking to \"Welt am Sonntag\"
Mursey's influence on all three branches of power in the State is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“The President of the de facto abolitionist State, in order to strengthen the civilian state, is sorry for Sayeda.
Indeed, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community looking at the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a payment for this.
A demonist on Tahrir Square warns: “You're creating a monster you can't control.
Norwegian racfisk: the world's worst smelling fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the country's success has something to do with a local passion for one extremely catchable fish dish?
Take some refried cheese slices.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the dismal smell of a racfist, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a little town called Fahernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's a very beautiful, but in the air, an inhospitable characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and rolled in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of shower you need.
As bagpipes thicken and cool, a crowd of Norwegians gather at a festival in Fahernes, which is about the same thing, say, an exciting dish.
- She's eaten raw, and they're baked with a rummy of a quirky water, and she's given an explanation of Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession, and a deputy missile general, who's leading the festival.
People around us eat small cubes of fish and drink them with lots of alcohol.
\"Some people like aquavit better than rakfisk.\" Havard says.
This drink is able to break down the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can put a piece under your nose, it's not that bad - it's very different from the dry part you've been carrying with you on a bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when fish were soaked in hermetically closed salty water barrels before the advent of refrigerators.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish was well and thorough enough, they were taken and used for food, drowning in the perception of alcohol.
Even before the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of employment and emigrate mainly to the United States.
At the same time, the population is growing rapidly, with over 13 per cent of the immigrants brought into work, high wages and a developed social security system.
The residents of Sweden (old rival, not as long as the more wealthy neighbour) are coming to work here.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an irreplaceable, even somewhat vicious, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive — a little beer or sandwich will cost you £9 (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears on world news, and most people in the country seem to agree.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Brawick, a racist and extremist right-handed man who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack was referred to as the one on 22 July —
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that one of their fellow citizens in their peace-loving country was capable of such atrocities and murder.
Norway ' s prosperity today is based on the growth (from the beginning of the seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
- One oil - not the only reason for our prosperity - - says Anna, our waitress, carrying trays of rakfi, a woman with long, light hair, and a striking blue eyes, the expression of the nordish well-being.
We are such a people as you call them, a people who are reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like showing up, we're not bragging.
Norway was very cautious about its oil supply, and most oil and gas revenues were investing in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they had fell, Norway was careful to calculate the cost.
- While you can ski in the winter and walk in the summer, that's enough for happiness. - Anna says.
- And there's a rakfisk. - She's adding with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - the racquet is enough of me.
That hamburger with loin meat is definitely exotic, delicious juiced meat.
But in the evening, we still have more and more fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel has a special rakfisk dinner, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most aromat fish.
There's a live television set showing the lead in a box tie, surrounded by racfic plates.
It's like a song contest, Eurovision.
So Tor-Jurgen, what an estimate you made of the best fish there in the mountains?
- Yeah, Haward, here's our estimate...
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling out of the chair, maybe taking the quirk.
Or maybe just smelling the fish.
The career of Enrique Penya Nieto, President of Mexico, will not be easy.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his population.
Road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly bad state.
The city was overloaded by transport and at a better time, and steel barriers were erected since Monday, cutting several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to allow people to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protestors from reaching the Parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and accept the bridal leadership of the country.
He has a challenge ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance at Felipe Calderón, now in office, but the country had lost some 60,000 lives in a six-year war on drugs.
“My Government is telling the people of Mexico that it is ready to combat violence,” said Mr. Penya Nieto, President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the White House Oval Cabinet earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto, the political career of the President of the United States, had developed as Governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, the new leader was divided.
A straight-lined person
In Valle de Bravo's idyllic town, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the building of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto is open to the city, which is very different from the exorbitant roads and pits that used to be in this area.
Tabs bearing his name hang in a modern sports centre building and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We associate with him hopes for real and profound change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Oliver Hernández, a state congressman led by Penya Nieto of the Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continued rule, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Olvera Congressman admits that after his 12-year absence at Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party holds high hopes in Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of loss of support that the new President has put before the opposition.
He is very direct and devoted to the work of translating his vision of the future of the country.
It's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualcoitl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the highway estacades, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of the harsh nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops had been deployed to curb drug gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
A few dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a large landfill in the past two years alone.
More than thousands of women were killed in Mexico City during the Governorate of Mr. Penya Nieto, a figure well above that in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Huárez, whose name has become crippling when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, it can be said at best that during his tenure as Governor, he failed to deal with the issue of the killing of women.
At the worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A woman living in a concrete house like most of the houses in this arson area, Irenai Bouendia, has a hard time holding back her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
On the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her life - styler.
When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed out before, and she remembers Ms. Bouendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was full.
Mariana's mother repeats this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, which has just one word on it: justice.
It was in this, they said, that this family was denied.
“State officials treated me like an old gossiper, a disgruntled peace breaker.
They want people to simply accept what they say and leave them alone.
But that's wrong, it's not true, especially when there's so many violations and shortcomings around it, she says.
President Peña Nieto will take on the presidency on Saturday and will take on a heavy responsibility with her.
During the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to give priority to this issue during his reign.
- I hope he'll be the same president as the governor, - says Oliver, a congressman from Valle de Brovo of the PRl party.
However, that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, he claims.
Prosecutors have tried to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, emphasis was placed on the presence of Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were harsh.
US military personnel are accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that private Bradley Manning, who was charged with the largest leak of classified material in US history, failed to avail himself of much opportunity to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had been transferred to a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, Military Prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits by prison authorities in nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
Cross-examination, as part of the appeal for termination of Manning ' s case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were severe and were sufficient in themselves, was held the day after Manning stated that he had been in custody and had intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were later published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed following the visits of Manning by the administration while he was in the Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During their visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the public prosecutor of Feyn asked on Friday about his reports, Manning admitted that he appreciated the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “predominant” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized” -
The reports considered do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly asked about his conditions of detention, Feyn argues.
Manning replied that he expressed his verbal concern over those issues and that the administration representatives who visited him had discussed those problems with him and had stated that they would be taken up but not recorded in writing.
They didn't write down -- there's no problem -- (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in a conversation -- says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a commission hearing suicidal intent, which he had expressed in writing months before.
Manning replied that, during that meeting, he wanted to be removed from the trauma prevention regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited prison regime - at a lower level than a surveillance regime to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect the prisoner as well as to protect others.
- I wanted to let the authorities know that everything was fine for me to abolish the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living could improve, in my opinion, -' explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness because of a severe fever.
He explained that psychologically it's very difficult when you're not allowed to know how you're going to be involved and what's going on in the outside world.
“My world has moved to Camp Ariffan's base, to the size of my prison,” said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in that cage.
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell, at least 21 hours, and often over 23 hours a day, in total loneliness.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave his mats, blankets, hats, clothes and glasses.
He says he tried to move, since sleeping or even lying in the daytime prohibited rules.
Manning said that while sleeping, he was constantly hitting the light from the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned to bed at night, he was told that he had been waked up and forced to turn around.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Liverworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he had made during the testimony on Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners on a morning test.
Manning said he couldn't cover the blanket during the check.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he had to throw a blanket that he could hide, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
Thursday Manning said last night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger.
Manning told the officer that he could use a coward's rubber or a blindfold to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, by Manning's testimony, his underwear, whores and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he has had to endure during his detention and significantly reduce his prison sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to commence his trial earlier next year.
Defence stated that it was intended to invite Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
Pentagon states that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of persons arrested under the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges brought by Manning are the aid of an enemy, the illegal promotion of Internet data disclosure, the transmission of information related to national defence, and the abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans had been forced to leave Mexico for lack of capacity to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American descent break between two cultures.
During my recent visit to Mexico City, I went down the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control area and fell asleep on the ground.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicans (Mexicans), one for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I turned to the complex construction of an American of Mexican descent.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers of the tongue, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and I got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was used to meet the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for Mexicans to remain in Mexico now, with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and ongoing issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events in all.
Therefore, it is only for a U.S. public figure to get involved in any form of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that complaints are being lodged that Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesum are a warrior.
Mexico ' s relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is the most complex.
Do you want to talk about offenses?
That's enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in Mexico and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent are just one reason: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- had no way to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most commonly, they were Mexicans of a certain type, who were narrow, uneducated, and poor farmers.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, that's not the case.
Today, our lives are the expression of the American dream, we studied in good schools, and we set ourselves up for good works, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most Mexican elites and the ruling class don't like us.
We do the same to them.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as second-class people, like the untrue Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to our failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now find ourselves behind a silk curtain, finding life in the United States but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there is some friction between real Mexicans and Mexicans -- Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans do.
She is a United States citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican descent do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstine as well.
With the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how nice it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
There's too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not think that country is so beautiful.
Excuse me, but deal with it yourself, amygos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they came with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still in harm's way for having recently treated their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas faction can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
A further round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It is common, senseless, disputes over who started it; many buildings are turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time during the conflict in the Gaza Strip, rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians were hopelessly bound together in their ongoing conflict, the Middle East was subject to change.
This may be the case in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many of the established realities in the storm, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the vortex, which is a shocking region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for hoping to break this fatal impasse.
War Without Winners
At first glance, this situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the cease-fire signed on 21 November is to be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the militants on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will state that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some of the leaders of the group had been destroyed and 1.7 million people had been blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel had failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new, powerful and wealthy friends.
The restored regional leader of Turkey, once Israel ' s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States in the Persian Gulf.
The trading supporters of Hamas claim the establishment of an Islamist peninsula around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which Hezbollah ' s paramilitary group rules, to Syria, where more and more Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s power, further to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatened by the king ' s authorities.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the power of the Muslim Brothers was strengthened by President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay special attention to Hamas's support.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hard - line supporters in Israel will come to opposing conclusions.
Hamas was defeated in a military sense.
The Israeli missile system, the Iron dome, justified its cost and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained loyal to its consistent position; many European countries also blamed the start of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly with the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although, since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by entering the West Bank's Jordan, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and by protecting Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, joined with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is quite convenient.
What is the point of giving the Palestinians a share of the power of the State?
If they hand over all power in the West Bank, would they not launch missiles from there towards Israel, as they did by gathering them in the Gaza Strip?
It is best to keep them behind the wall and to severely suppress any attempts to lift their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of hard lines will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
Although Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not feel the warmest feelings for Israel, their priorities will be domestic problems.
Israel ' s border budget is greater than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional super-Power would hardly help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursey, who, together with Barack Obama, was working on a ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to a lesser extent, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries escalate, the denial of the right to self-determination by Palestinians constitutes a time-consuming bomb that will explode sooner or later in the occupied territories of Israel, like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv this week.
Represses already undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum.
There remains a single solution, to which wise representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world, and our newspaper — the education of two States and Israel ' s concessions to the territories in exchange for security, are relentlessly calling.
The hope remains, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will enable other countries to better influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to close arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more favourable position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967 in the light of the exchange of territories and the sharing of the use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would be more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than for the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of Palestinian virtual statehood.
President Obama must also play his role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his reluctance to be involved in the problem.
This is a catastrophicly short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a law on uniform cigarette packaging had entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of diseased body parts are contrasted with those of sprinkling green boxes similar to those of all cigarette marks.
The first in world practice, the Australian law on one-type packing of cigarettes and tobacco has entered into force, replacing logos and the coloring of different stamps with the same box of low-live olive colour, with images of diseased body parts and images of children who are affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages imposed on this Saturday is the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small print.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashion habit.
This decision was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking under 26 years of age in 99 cases, out of 100, never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning of how tobacco companies attempt to communicate through packaging — explains the Minister of Health Tanya Plybersec, referring to studies that show that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with a princess’s idea.
Australia was one of the world ' s smallest smokers, so that these changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were considering taking such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry were particularly opposed to the enactment of the Act.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
- This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators - said Scott McIntair, a representative of the British American Tobacco Company in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws help business growth.
Sandra Ha, of a small family company called Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that demand for Portsigars and silicon casemakers hiding unpleasant pictures on the package grew rapidly (actually from scratch) since companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case before the High Court of Australia two months ago, where they tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 items to wholesalers and is awaiting a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures was, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the very part of the population to which those measures were directed.
Since the enactment of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television cigarette advertising and support for sports events, as well as bans on sellers to put cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has been moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertisements online, but it cannot be restricted to foreign sites.
- If you're trading tobacco and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of moving your product online will be very exciting - this is Becky Freeman explaining public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of trademark reviews written by supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really a matter of the hands of an ordinary citizen who likes the marlboro cigarettes so much that he hasn't spared his strength and time and made a video, or is it behind a commercial campaign?
The British American Tobacco Office of Australia claims that industry is more engaged in adapting to new regulations than advertising.
The tobacco industry even sponsored Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are claiming within the World Trade Organization that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, even though the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plybersec, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of anti-smoking photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia have been shown to fall short of innovation.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I just don't pay attention.
- Just take the cigarette out and hide the pack in your pocket, explains Victor El Haig, buying the cigarettes with a photo of an oral tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James You, the manager of the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods on the shelves
- I've had an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours, he complains.
- The government had to take and ban cigarettes completely, we'd say, well, it's over, we're closing the store, he says, throwing his hands up.
Running through the world of electronics and fixed connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving day, I had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the scooter.
I'm not fooling you.
The afternoon at the airport, waiting for the flight, is really boring, and there won't be much help in either books or magazines or iPhones or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, a growing number of scientists and experts in child development have been in favour of sparing.
They say that in certain situations it is not that bad for us and for our children to miss.
This makes the brain distracted into interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of the scooter are passing us.
Maybe we should go to the scooter.
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll come back to it.
I used to think, like many, that the scooter was an invention about the recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, states Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of the book The Fading History of Sucks, (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
\"In fact, a scooter may boast a very ancient story,\" he says.
Latin inscriptions of the first century snug were found on the walls of Pompeii.
At the same time, the question of how we understand scum remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the scooter has often changed.
After studying the research material on the subject and asking a 100-person task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Scum is when people want to, but cannot do, what would please them -
The difference between a bite and apathia, he says, is that the boring person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything about apathy.
Mainly in the boring, he says, it is a lack of attention and a resulting deterioration of mood and a feeling that time is going slowly.
The description of the scooter may seem very depressed.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and in the circumstances, and those suffering from depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when it's really hard for us to concentrate on something.
In his study, Unoccupied Mind: The definition of attention - published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an experiment that had been conducted earlier, with participants listening to the recording of voices reading the magazine.
Some of the participants also heard the loudest sounds of a television programme not relevant to the case in the next room, others heard the same sounds on low volume, so that they could barely be heard, and a third group listened only to the recording of voices without the outside soundtrack.
Those who heard the low volume television said that they were bored, more often than not, that they had difficulty concentrating, but they didn't know the reason for that, and they attributed it to the scooter.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenceke, associate professor of neuroscience at Gwelf University, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something that's not interesting - for example, when we look in the stream of goods on the conveyor to find a marriage, the distraction of music can help us to avoid snug -
It is believed that when people start to duck on a chair or draw a caricle on a sheet of paper, they do so from a bite, but now we know that such actions actually help us not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not forbidden to rust and turn, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit down,” states Professor Fenceke.
At some point, all of us experience a scruple of listening to monotonous speech while watching an uninterested film.
However, different people show different degrees of snugness.
In the 1980s, in order to measure such particularities, researchers developed a special scooter scale -
Questions and assertions are used to determine such a scale, for example - A lot of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously - or - I'm too interested, so there's not enough time to do -
Researchers used these questionnaires to determine that boys miss girls more often, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored at all times.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at Illinois University, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day with the aid of a pager.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3 per cent of parents felt bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on how such snug data would have been now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “you have a snug tendency for teenagers ” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what they want to do.
Let's go back to my original question: the scooter is useful?
Sometimes it is not because, in extreme terms, it has been shown to encourage people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, high - risk gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to rid themselves of scum.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
- So our brain tells us we have to do something else; it's a scum - - says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this very brain does not always know what it is best to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy into a guitar game or a culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, it's better for you only for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight the boring on his own or to manage his time and employment in any other way, Professor Fenceke says.
- And these self-regulation skills are applied in a variety of situations - he argues.
Your kid doesn't just learn to do something on his own, he's also learning self-control at all.
I don't think the scoot needs to be overcarnated.
But it's not worth it, either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable, even without a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
- We see it in a way that we need more of a scum, but that the scooter is an extremely unpleasant, unsatisfying desire to do something meaningful - he says.
In fact, people are trying to get rid of their constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we’re used to the constant and excessive stimulation of the organs of feeling,” he says, “and when silence arrives, we lose and we don’t know what to do.
As yet, it is unclear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a college student in the south-east of Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: the possession of a small serving of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Oroso said that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamara and were driving at a prairie car near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found it in a marijuana machine, Mr. Orosko filed an application for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-use device, a minor offence, for each of which a $100 fine was due, and the date of the trial was scheduled.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. Oroso says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted several weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases does not depend on the law as much as on the location.
The charges of minor offences related to marijuana are already withdrawn in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which have taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges to people 21 years of age or older for possession of small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, the prosecutors decided to deal with the current marijuana cases and continued to hold the drug held accountable.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver to the West, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from entering their cities.
- It's happening so fast that I don't even know what to wait for. - says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Control officials in Washington state are also admiring heads.
They will have rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana issues, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they would be a good example -- explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Alcohol Production and Marketing Board in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admit Mr. Smith, than make some suggestions and hope that this will work.
- We don't have a real precedent to guide us - he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will enter into a state of uncertainty for a whole year when the State licensing system is not yet available and the ownership of marijuana is legal.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's regulation of adequate access to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trade 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana companies in the line of cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs” explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly established research group, “The Centre for the Legalization of Marijuana”
On 21 November, the chief of police from Aurora sent an e-mail message to his police that the city's public prosecutor's office would no longer hold those who had reached the age of 21 responsible for having a small number of marijuana, and that the police would cease to implicate people in these violations - starting at that time -
The Chief of Police Outs reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with regulations governing marijuana cultivation for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The Prosecutor of the Ould District in the north of Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to this matter.
After the vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to hold Marijuana responsible, primarily to encourage those who used it to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons have been charged with keeping two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The responsibility of our institution to prosecute acts considered criminal at the time of their commission” said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where the voting participants rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of a small number of drugs.
District attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges in already open cases relating to the possession of marijuana.
- I believe that to enforce the law until it changes - our immediate responsibility - he says.
Although 55 per cent of the population of Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reactions of residents in different parts of the state have revealed a mixed attitude among the local authorities towards the state's experiment with marijuana.
The District Prosecutors have a cultural barrier on this issue - explains Sean Makalister, a Denver lawyer representing the convicts ' interests for keeping marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for Law Reform on marijuana.
- They've been chasing people for this for so long, that they can't really accept that this isn't a crime anymore, he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first state to have a small number of marijuanas, are expected to be a pilot country-wide field to test the very idea of the legalization of drugs.
Legalists and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but, at the same time, they are fearful of instructions from the federal authorities that continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hoped that the Office of Justice would give in.
Despite several widespread arrests of traffickers and patients using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government has in most cases provided good for the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, D.C. and 16 other states.
Agents of the Counter-Narcotics Bureau are unlikely to burst into homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-controlled recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, former drug control adviser to Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local authorities had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which would never have been open sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western state, submitted a six-month ban on the traffic in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
- We don't want to be in such a position that we're going to give someone a license, and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level. - Bob Nicholson, a city council member, says.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the State voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt, I was excommunicated from Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, the modern analogy to an ancient symposium, which provides two foundations for civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the History School of Wooster College, Oxford University, at the end of the eightties, I collected the suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and wept.
Friends were cut off.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer, E. Norman Wilson, was joking that I was leaving because I had to drink from the sprinkling cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I escaped because I was systematically mutilated and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or what I went to a private school.
I was grassed for only one reason, and in this famous education cradle, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a conservative supporter myself.
You're going to ask me why do you remember that now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with right-wing views is subject to the same herbation.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College of Christie College student club in Cambridge claim that they are - often isolated, assaulted, and made feel unwelcome - because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student policy, \"Strane Wonders: Young, Smart, and Right \" , in which conservatives submitted themselves to eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rides in Rolls Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver cane.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making vacations because of an increase in school fees -
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, interviewed one of the Sunday newspapers and said that “the university environment is increasing distortion towards leftist views.
People who don't even know us, in advance, think of us as the naked and disciplined children of rich parents --
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Christie College of History, who applied for increased protection, calls the atmosphere “impossible” and Stefanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitudes of student club members towards right-wing holders have deteriorated considerably.
- It's a threat to both the climate of intellectual discussion and just to the normal life of club members - she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, with an 18 - year - old girl stuck and stuck.
Oxford has been horrified by the hatred of the conservative party.
One year earlier, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, had been deprived of her honor because of her budget cuts in the area of higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinist would be imprudent.
In the early days of the week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was in the front door.
I had not yet known that teachers not only looked through the fingers at the grass-roots of conservative students but were also happy to participate.
Political issues - the strike of miners, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against the apartheid Government in the UAR - have infiltrated wooden panels of the audience wall.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
Miss Wyatt, the teacher, Harry Pitt, is now dead. Please translate the first paragraph.
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very hot man with a face like cake.
- The dancers don't learn French in principle, or they just don't have enough brains, - he asked.
Other students were sneezing.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take some of the first French lessons at leisure, if you are not, of course, very busy turning around in society.
I'm back in my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting at lunchtime alone, and then someone swung me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Faculty who presented himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Every person suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you'll find it harder.
Most pre-school conservators pretend to be Labourists.
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hypocrite.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
It's so tricky.
A graduate student in the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious -
Other students picked up his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
- How do conservators do sex?
- They're nagging each other, really--
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixtieth years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Would I have to become a Labourer and hide my real convictions?
For the next three years, I began to look like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative but also for being an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speakers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his provinciality, smallness and commitment to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took his position as professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
- You're not gonna be happy here.
I went to Oxford from my home in London, trying to find refuge with relatives and open - minded friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieth years, any political views were adopted.
'But it's the best university in the world,' he lamented.
- They can't do this in the city of drowsy pins.
Even my Communist friends have always behaved irreproachably...
His wet eyes muffled.
Don't make haste decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of the university
I was exhausted by my constant travel to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not stand up and renounce his beliefs.
Next week during a seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
Burning in my soul from shame, I confessed that my parents had washed my mind and called them old fools.
The break was short.
The last nail in the lid of my career at Oxford was to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications of Rupert Merdoku.
My door was locked.
I didn't come out, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I collected the suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a placard and a rag.
But at 18 years of age, no one should be subjected to such malice and intimidation at the educational institution.
The sad thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released the 14 Prime Ministers of the Tators, but is still hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free-thinking.
♪ Valentino prefers the elegance of glory ♪
About the Valentino Exhibition: a sewing master -- which opened this week in London -- ABC talks with Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz and other well-known customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of taking the exhibition on Valentino Garawani.
The designer acknowledged this at the time of the opening of the Valentino: a sewing master, the triumphal retrospect exhibition, which combines more than 130 high - fashion dresses created by his house, over the past 50 years.
I love this palace, he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of history, the only character of which is - yl Siniore - Garawani, but could not have been written without his named clients.
Valentino has always felt a dejected, rare, far - reaching world of knowledge.
In the first room of the exhibition, opened before 3 March, they beat up personal letters and photographs for the signature of the most prominent aristocratics, from the Princess Salima Aghan to Lord Snoudon, including Marie Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble porter from Voger town in northern Italy to a godfather of international elites;
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
\"They don't at least shave their cigarettes about your beautiful carpet, like some beautiful pop music stars do.\" Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz says.
We both lived in the Alps in the 1960s and 1970s and were good friends.
Valentino is an unloving host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
- We all liked to come to his pail in Gtaad - - explains the ex-wife - Heini - Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautifuls like Marella Angeli or Evgenia Niarhos.
Valentino always suggested the elegance of fame.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valerie Mazya, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valerie Maty remembers a charismatic modeler.
Once we went to his house to have dinner, it was after showing the fashions at Spain's square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was displayed in every part of his apartment, her dress, her food, his music.
- Each of Valentino's guests felt important and loved - remembers the Top Model - whose work with the model began during the 1995 High Fashion Week in Paris.
He's never out of fashion, because his sketches are real works of art -- she ends up.
Parade of Birthrights
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was turned into a glamorous 60-metre floor into a role changer: a visitor takes a model and has to defile on a podium, a peer-in-the-sight from the scars that are ringed by the masterpieces of Valentino, such as a dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a suit that was used by Monica Vitti in Nochi, or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the Empress Fara Diba.
Model names such as Sibilla Luxembourgish, Gloria von Turn Und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine in this audience.
Nati Abbasl and modeler, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, you can't forget--
I remember him beautifully.
They were pants, shirts, jackets, and jackets from autumn winter collection 1971-1972.
- It was the gift he gave me, - says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer's museums.
♪ I read him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty ♪ ♪ ♪ added the old Duchess de Ferria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have a lot of light and they come to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
The princess and the fashion lawyer Patricia d’Arenberg could not forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to put it on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a handkerchief, a carsage in a fold, and a cut without breechs.
- It was a dream that came to be. - Says Rodrigo D. Arenberg's widow.
Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary -- explains this Italian aristocratic woman living between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess D. Arenberg keeps his holiday dress from a modeler with \"maximum caution\"... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it...
-Corole - Fashion
The great final exhibition at Somerset House is a wedding dress by Marie-Santal Miller for her marriage to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 - girls - (called the modeler of their stitches) - to make this line out of a silk of ivory with an incision of pearls, twelve species of different circles, and a plume of four and a half feet [4 and a half m].
According to journalist Suzie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is the milestone of the late twentieth century, the return of clients from the higher world,
For many years now, the elite is the best representative of Valentino.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (the highest rank in Italy), Labour Cavalier, Order Commander of Art and Wordism, awarded by the Order of the Honorable Legion, Garavani collected as much honor as any of his clients' spouses.
- My attention was always drawn to his subtlety, his calmness, his careful and impure appearance, and Dr. Arenberg's memories.
The last time I saw him, I saw him last month at the solemn dinner at the Ors Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
- He was useless, time doesn't exist for him.
If this is what the princess says...
The world's hardest profession: miners from Kawah Ijeen
In four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by sucking 70 kilos of sulphur on top of a volcano along a steep, rocky route.
There are people who work for them -- hell, and others are literally working for hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn a lifetime of sulphur in the Kawah Ijgen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rising from the deeps of the Earth stalls when it contacts the air.
The huge pieces of sulphur, with a combined weight of 70 kg, are cut into two bamboo baskets, ringing the baskets on their shoulders, and carrying them upstairs on a crumbling stone road.
Until the peak of a volcano of 2,386 metres is only 250 metres high, it takes over 40 minutes for worn-out trucks to rise in a turtle's step, with difficulty in keeping the balance and stoking the road carefully so as not to fall off or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as was the case with a French tourist who crashed several years ago from the Kawah Ijen rocks.
Kawah-Ijeen miners earn five euro cents per kilogram of sulphur they extract
When they reach the top, they pave their way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and were tired of heavy baskets, walking three kilometres to the weights that the mining company placed just above, at 1,850 metres.
This is the PT of Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, rather, its employees, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euros) of petrochemical production, as it is common in daily life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“ Since the norm is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per move - explains Anto, who usually performs three daily shifts.
He spends three hours on each of them and feels broken up at the end of the day, but they allow him to accumulate rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems like a hint for such a human effort, it's three more than what he would earn in the field.
“The miner’s daily fee is very high in local measures, where 15,000 rupees (Euro1.2) are paid for coffee collection on a day and an average monthly wage equal to two million rupees (Euro167),” explains a truck who used to work as a stoneman on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwang, a town near the volcano, for a substantial reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as Sera: “I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus are, and brought her to Java to accept Islam.
Anto's asthma, he breathes hard, coughs all the time, and he gets blind because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah Ijeen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the existence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's going to get his eyes closed because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay for his dream.
I'll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French, and he promises in more than acceptable English.
In his life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waitress or a hotel port, but instead he does the work of a mule.
For the sake of a dirty wooden cabin with other wearers, it rises every day at two o’clock in the night, because the gray does not stop running out at night when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
In challenging shadows, Ana goes down to the crater, exposing himself to the path of a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work for and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even part of the 30,000 rupees (Euro2.5), which, together with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (Euro1.2), is used by the guards to charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its mulch people.
- This is work for cattle, not for humans - - says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root bearer who spent three decades on Kawah-Ijeen since he left college.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he's sure he's going to endure work -- as much as he can -- because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the gray burns their throats and burns their eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so exposed that no one is complaining about their serious diseases... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosos, knee pains and ulcers on their shoulders, which have formed under the weight of the basket.
In balancing the basket on the back, Unanik can only lift 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions take 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometres along a narrow trip among the plants.
- I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life, - says Unanik, a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, age 30, he's also a sulphur carrier.
Time goes by, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the way human mules from Kawah Ijen are employed.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, housing prices, and education for children's absence.
The population of Singapore needs to grow -
I'm the husband of a patriot, you're my wife patriot, you're our civil duty and we're going to create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mint label advertisement, but despite this -- or possibly so -- this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings such as - Let's put a bao (bull) in the oven - to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining way through advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to make people pay their national debt -
That's the only thing for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's a major problem in the country.
We are the worst of the world's reproductions of ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject we should address.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot, for example, launch spirits with pheromones or organize quick-joining parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, well, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to make rap?
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it so lightly is the Singaporean Government.
It spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, renews maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But it's all very effective.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city State in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population office, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 was known as the replacement percentage in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Office for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Directorate for Population, said that the reason for \" better education \" and \" more extensive career opportunities \" .
“This has enabled people to have a broader set of options in terms of life’s goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the delayed marriage and birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the fertility rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population declines, has caused resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where there is little hatred of many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not wanting to be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year Singapore's ruling party received the worst results in elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline of fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical spending and immigration policies, Singapore's example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to construct so much small housing.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development manual has shifted to control the number of small apartments known as shoeboxes — which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments are sold very well.
Nevertheless, it is felt that they can contribute to a cold lifestyle and discourage the incentives of the builders who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that these apartments are being bought up for a few days, even weeks, faster than bigger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance for builders who were previously made obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have any special effect.
- People are too busy, they're expensive, they're just like education, and because of that, many people are putting it off - - a young ruler says.
Others may have children.
“ But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20 - year - old man.
Men and women refer to their careers, stresses, and prices of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from raising children.
So, whatever the Government has tried to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Offline personal on the Internet
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is the property of private or personal life that is entitled to protect against any interference -
What is personal about a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he use this definition in his daily life and in his social networks?
Does he understand the dangers of Internet discussions that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five people between the ages of 10 and 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with something very mine -- in a personal plane, in a password and in the name of a user -- when they applied it to social networks.
- I wouldn't upload my greatest secrets to the post - says ten-year-old Jorge, when he's trying to explain the value of a personal site on Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got accounts for two years now.
- These are secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world. - He says.
I load beautiful pictures or games on FB.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
- I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or someone who behaves foolishly, he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish unintelligible photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge believes he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his Twitter foulers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I got Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
- I don't know if I'm responding, I'm just uploading them, - he's adding.
\"Social networks -- entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends in a quick manner -- he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never have accepted a request from an stranger.
I wouldn't think of someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
José's 14-year-old is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and lastly admits he doesn't know the 20 people added to his friends list.
- It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example - it points out.
According to the boy, no one took him seriously or asked for his home address or phone number.
- If they pressure me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my account - he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
One of my friend’s acquaintances was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted.
He never knew who it was, he assures me.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
♪ Only include confidentiality ♪
He then explains the sequence of steps to adjust the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded pictures of people who knew in uncomfortable or confrontational situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I don't like it or if I want it.
- Although I know it's cybermobbing, he confirms.
Key issues
Marílos Porras, an English teacher and an education and learning expert, believes that to guide children and adolescents, the goal of social networking should be to inform.
- The internet has come up as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game have changed - she notes.
Porras points out that academics Mark Prenski, a teacher at Yale University, and the author of labour, digital Aborigines and immigrants, have coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and young people born in the age of technology.
- We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning - she says.
Explains that this subject is difficult, because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken at the age when maturity is not enough to do so.
“So that they are elected, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without any consequence,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that confidentiality is for children and adolescents to ask questions that make them think.
To tell them not to do this is useless. She adds.
Then Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do that on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish a picture of you as if you were publishing about your friend?
Do you know others are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures from parties, do you ask other people for permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online the same way that offline does.
The rules are the same.
“Out of the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, and they must be on social networks,” she argues.
Diligence
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for heads of family to read social networking policies in good faith.
They understand each point and have good reason to talk to their children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
- For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published - he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson - don't talk to strangers -
UNASSUR ' s Summit Ends Without Publicization of the Lima Declaration
VI. The presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has been concluded today in Peru without the declaration of the Lima Declaration, which was previously and theoretically signed by seven compulsory parties.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI next meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
To questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Olianta Umala, during short press statements.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit has been limited all the time.
It was only broadcast during the day, in the press room, that the video of the presidential assembly without the sound of a message - a closed meeting, no sound -
A little information circulating among the reporters was transmitted by some UNASUR Governments' press secretaries attending the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, resulting in the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who requested more information.
Subsequently, the President of Peru's administration sent an e-mail to the media on the final declaration, the summit, but a statement by Umala rather than an official document by which the summit concluded.
In last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA) and, at the same time, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had tried to ensure that all journalists were transmitted, but had limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the Hague Court verdict, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala and Chile, Sebastian Pinheer, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague with the statements of both sides, as part of the charge that Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will observe and execute a decision that will explain the differences we now present before this international court.” said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is and will be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals — added Pinier, and welcomed Umalou’s hands against the flags of the two countries.
The two Presidents ' confirmation that they would submit to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week the Bogotá Pact, which found it subordinated to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it found to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Russef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011, after the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects to South American countries had been approved, with estimated investments of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we were expanding residence agreements -
He reported that action was being taken to improve cooperation against citizens ' uncertainty and organized transnational crime, to increase access to drugs, to access the Internet in all corners of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risk of natural disasters -
Since Europe is in crisis, the economic alliance (Latin America) should not have a triumphal base, but should serve to expand our productive base and predict a better future for our cities, Umala added.
“We decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 prominent projects that would improve the link between South America’s territory, especially in the village and border zones... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes,” said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five relate to Peru and are limited to cross-sections on its territory from the coast to Brazil, while two focus on a greater relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as a re-accession to the Union of South American Nations — from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among its neighbours was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on a Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner a maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogota.
“ The pastor (to Saturday) may be meeting with President Daniel Ortega, ” said Santos.
“We will review all these ways, they will not be mutually exclusive, including a covenant with Nicaragua that will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he emphasized.
- With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this as much as possible in a civilized and respectful way as possible - added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on a Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a presence in the presidency of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers met in advance to adopt the Plan of Action for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela form UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
Southern America must learn from Europe about the integration of citizenship - Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which South America, in this case, must learn from Europe -
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, declared to the State television of Peru that Europeans had killed each other during the Second World War -- and in other clashes -- but now they're almost one thing --
He defended, in this context, a project to establish South American citizenship, which supports UNASUR member countries.
“There must be free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want to bring us back to the past” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also been a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never commit to anything, and we South American people do, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington, D.C., and financed by the United States,” said Ecuador’s founder Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured him that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his deep values of democracy and human rights.
He added that in due course there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be observed —
He criticized, moreover, Swedish justice for demanding to enter his territory for questioning about the alleged sexual offence, while - the Swedish law considers it possible to implement it by means of a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London -
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of Assanja's physical and mental health.
- I haven't spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small legal problem, nothing serious,' said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What's real is that it's a risk of a deterioration in his physical and mental health because of being trapped in a small space without the ability to exercise on the air.
- It affects the health of any person. - He added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted by Assanjo since June to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of integrity that would enable him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the founding of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights; we do not use that word here, but have been a constant debate.
“The resolution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja counsel, Balthasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European bodies” he mentioned.
And I thought that, if Britain was to provide a guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it would end --
If Sweden, as it is perfectly capable of its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assanja in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him on Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate -- mediation, unbelief and lies that distort freedom of expression --
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt evil politicians, but bad journalists, who support gain, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither these journalists nor the Bankers nor the Jehemona bourgeois countries were dominant in Ecuador; and added that, once re-elected, they were in a revolution to continue development in the right direction —
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay ' s veto in UNASUR until at least the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for masculinism coups” because in fact, “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”
The Ecuadorian President, moreover, found it entirely justified — the wish of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision has not been respected.
This is a problem between the South American and the Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be handled together to overcome them and to continue moving forward.
He also looked forward to the good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute that the same court of Peru and Chile had held, and said that it was appropriate for Latin America to apply to international bodies if the two countries committed themselves to making a decision, however difficult it might be —
Referring to the possibility of serving as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to stand for a third consecutive term, he said that he was considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is difficult to do so”
Correa assured me that if she lost her election in February 2013, she would leave public life.
In my personal view, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be rectified by political power.
- My political movement thought it was me who had guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If we were to win, it would be my final term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
- That's the decision. - He confirmed it.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to treatment, which was already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
- That doesn't mean an increase in President Chávez's health-- he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS Today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had been a positive one.
\"I'm as if I'm deaf\" -- he remembers that hard, despite the doctor's tactics, the moment.
A young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to handle the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much as he could, and his efforts were justified -- he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the oldest HIV patients in the Hospital Hospital Hospital, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he entered in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus -- (HIV) for 22 years -- and it would be hard to believe in that in the early 1990s -- too little then existed for treatment, too little for the disease, too prejudiced for the sick.
So, even the director of a clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn't want to say goodbye to him, because he had a cut.
In other words, AIDS was a sentence at that time.
It is now possible to survive the syndrome and do so without affecting the quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing the disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged them, “made up their immune system, and they are suffering from opportunistic infections. ”
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, - a major achievement to date is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same - indicated by HCG ' s head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to this information confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectivist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality depend on the extent to which patients have an immune system at the start of diagnosis with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years of age with 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives a diagnosis of an HIV positive at the age of 25 according to these terms - supporting control - will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years - explained.
In order to assess that progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now, on average, 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Halisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 deaths had already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, it's the business at our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a problem with drugs, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their condition, which is, at the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they have any opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore to provide detection samples on a massive scale, for all people who ask for it.”
In its proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA) and the patients themselves, like Fabricio, who turned to a private laboratory, motivated only by his friend and, despite his youth, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered a sarcoma Kaposha, a cancer tumor, which is a common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
\"If I die anyway, I'd rather get dressed three times a week,\" they say, but not in my case.
There's some positive changes, I'm good at doing exercises, taking drugs.
To date, his parents only know he's had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
- I'm working, I'm doing a lot of work, I'm traveling, I'm having an active sex life, but I'm sharing responsibility, I'm taking care of myself and another person - I listed Fabricio, who has agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to convey his statement to those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are fearful.
Let it be checked if there is a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, as best as possible, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person, being responsible.
His report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Presets by Shack
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who was dealing with HIV-related programmes, is a major gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In the field on this problem, the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, now we're given packs of 100, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who don't have access to the condom right now,” he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
- Why do you think they're a popular question, and with the help of social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I propose that this be modified by inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only behind stalls and that a hundred of them be found in machines in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not an encouragement to debauchery.
It was not about paying for beer and motel, and Governor Emilio González replied when he was asked if condom distribution was possible in his leadership.
- It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity, - he said.
Key data in Halisco
13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV cases) have been recorded.
The State ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it in one recorded case.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that annuls the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a long-term precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has capacity to pay problems.
It seems that the procedures for supporting the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical terms, the judgement rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hayle before the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of the Rio Grand.
However, the ruling opens the doors to the lead manufacturer of glass glass in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, bringing three inconsistencies into evidence.
As a joinder, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings related to the competitive proceedings before Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvent of transnational enterprises.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been established, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that, without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of the competitive debt production that the vitro affiliates had before the parent company, there would not have been a majority required to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose interfirm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Production.
It is also true that, in calculating the voices of affiliates, one way or another, the creditors of the Vitro who fought against him in United States courts, namely, the vultures funds - like the Aurelios Capital, the Aurelios Convergencia, the Elliot Internacional and the Livepool Limited - would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent, compared to 37.
These figures are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that he has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced in striking the country.
So far, González Sada ' s family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote will reach his plenary, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be made, which will require a review by the highest court, in the present case of the United States Supreme Court.
Worse yet, the court rejected the document submitted by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae, a friend of the court, which described the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it was releasing itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it to section 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules established for inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambol, they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
Given the months of complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación Trade Unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of being a fraud, the Trade Union ' s Association of Aircraft Pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The institution, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the oversight body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operation performed by the entrepreneur for the recovery from the trust fund of F/589 of Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares by the Professional Management Company of hotels.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Around Dragon Mart
Meeting at the Caribbean University weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about the giant shopping and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and products from an isolated country, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which had aligned some of the protected areas with the land and posed serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s requirement to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the acronym in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already become an archive.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified it as a violation of the freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run

Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector-Hetin-Reyes: \"Basketball was my life\"
Hector - Hethin - Reyes, a full-time basketball traveler, was more than 60 years involved in the sport and, thanks to it, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember so many basketball stories, like Hector-Hetin-Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhage led him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-class player, a top basketball league player, a BSN leader and a BSN leader with Baimon Cowboys and the president of the basketball Federation.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was President BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during Primer Hora’s visit to his home to Baymon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
♪ Basketball was my life ♪
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this allegation.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered over his long journey, bear witness to this.
A Baimon in the Heart
He retains with the greatest emotions those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age as an agent or agent of the contract.
It was my best years that I enjoyed the most, because it was possible to be part of the eight Cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, a co-agent, or a leader.
There were many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsy's debut at BSN.
From that moment forward, Cuko-Ortiz, who was the great administrator, pointed out Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was coming here and at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me: \"I have a very strong player for you, six to seven.
- You want to -
And that was the beginning of Minsk, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minski had brought the Bayamon Champion, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988, I had been the manager of the federation.
By that time, I had been expecting to enjoy his achievements and those of Minsk in the national assembly.
I remember how we won the first time in the U.S. during an Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got a fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us win the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just like the one who won the 2004 Olympics Dream Team.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the United States, which was pretty much like the one that won our bronze in the World Cup.
Not only were the Minsks, Gaussa, Ramon Rivas, Fiko Lopez and Pikulina (Ortisa) played again, but also the young (Havière) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, León's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kiote' Morales, who could not participate in 90 due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was a 1995 Olympic Qualitative Tour team in Neucken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner, to replace players suspended for riot in the Pan American Mar del Plata champion, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pikulin Ortiz.
Its performance on international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level in the way Picculin did.
And that's without taking his career into account in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melences, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your major achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that there were up to 17 teams in BSN in the early 1990s.
What are you left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to play Ponce boys only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in National Plei-off.
Now guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos from my YouTube era, enjoy my grandchildren, and rarely go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabelle, which has always been with me.
Acter Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Werte, Texas, became world-known because of his central role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., on TV series - Dallas - in which he proclaimed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulation.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnet predator Jay Ar Yuing in the \"Dallas\" series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season - Dallas - died on Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement given for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Production studio - Dallas -
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing a prominent role that he liked most,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on a fair to Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sikwell, was next to Hegman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her representative Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gentle and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
- He was an original and lived a full life - he confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent transplantation.
Long before - Dallas - Hegman had gained a reputation on television by acting as a decent type in light comedy - I Dream of Jannie - broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive young woman named Barbara Eden and begins living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on air, The Good Life - (NBC, 1971-72) and -Here We Go Against - (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included roles well received by critics, in The Group - - Harry and Tonto - and -Primary Colors -
But it was his master's interpretation of the amazingly disgusting J.R. that brought Hegman to the top of his glory.
The Dramatic CBS series on the Yuing clan and other characters in its environment was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
Advertising slogan - Who shot J.R. - designed to create a noise surrounding an episode of complete emotion in which Hegman's character is almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars of risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the episode of November 1980 was answered, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned it into \"Dallas\" in the second number of shows of entertainment in history, after Final MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s brother-in-law, Christine (in charge of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. had her interfered and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an immoral corruptionist with a charismatic smile: an immoral entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife to have an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), placed for treatment.
- I know what's supposed to be on the J.R.C., said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said: \"There shall be an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing--
That's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone who was massive, both on and off screen -
He is unforgettable and indispensable to the millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new release, Dallas, were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
A record of five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth was in production, reporting the canal.
Warner or TNT had not yet made a statement about what would happen to the series after Hegman left.
Forth-Whert, Texas, he was the son of an actress and singer, Mary Martin, who flashed in classic works such as - South Pacific - and - Peter Pan -
Martin was still a teenager when he gave birth to him in 1931 during his marriage to Lawyer Ben Hagman.
He attempted happiness in the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Navy from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many famous people lived.
In 2001 he called his memoirs Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life -
- I didn't put anything in there that seemed capable of hurting someone or affecting them in any way. - He said to Prensa Asociada at the time.
After transplanting his liver, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help fear patients.
I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they're on operations, and then he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but you'll be fine.
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course is started - The end of the world -
Students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming every week.
In this semester, when a professor of religion, Stuart Sharma, decided to follow a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irrefutable lure: the end - long reverse - the Maya calendar, on 21 December, for which many people were taking hold as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected in the next few months: Sandy’s catastrophic storm, the financial crisis, which some call the long-armeddon, and the growing conflict to which Israel will enter, a place where Christian theories of the end believe that Apocolipsis will begin.
- I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all. - I told Sharma this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we look at what's happening in the world now, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world -- this semester, theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Walker is reading a course entitled “The media, culture and the end of the world”
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
- We're looking at why these ideas spread over time - he said, and the way that they offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain kinds of human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, students analyzed movies on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
- I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall of Latin America and his colleague Amar Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, came together to read a course called the Light End
\"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come\" said Restall.
Despite the impregnable destruction, students must study, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken to the Canon of Apocolipsis, leaving no choice but to work until the very night at which the end of the world is supposed to come, says Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
“The place ended in two hours,” Restal said of his course for high - average students, which was attended by 35 students.
We received e-mails many weeks before the semester was started by people who asked if there were any more places.
The students, in turn, assure us that this course is one of the most interesting.
- I like to see what people do to comfort themselves, - says Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers Camden.
And apocalyptic thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Veques, a 25-year-old graduate of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
- I've never heard of a course that I've learned from it. - He noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone a professor -- said he believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
Our first project touched on the prophecy of the Maya, and in some ways we discredited him,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Templ University in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, says Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries of people reacting to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has generated an increase in those speculations.
\"In other places people don't think about it,\" he said.
Predominantly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question as to whether he knew any course at the end of the world there.
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote, pointing to a higher authority.
We have the Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been stated for a long time and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, people would immediately start thinking about the next date — or philosophizing that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some say they're going to end-of-the-light parties.
Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together-- commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of Communications.
