Italy's public debt has increased to record levels
Italy's national debt in June 2016 exceeded Euro2.248 trillion.
In the central bank, countries stated that this amount was a historic maximum, and RIA News was being transmitted.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
At that time, the amount of the State debt reached Euro2.228 trillion.
It is noted that in the first half of the year Italy's debt burden has increased by Euro77.2 billion.
Italy had previously been reported to have accounted for 132.7 per cent of GDP at the end of 2015.

Scientists Found an Animal That Can Live 500 Years
The international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandian polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, leading to slow development.
The females of Greenland’s sharks only reach puberty by 150 years.
Previously, it was believed that the neighbors of the Greenlandic whale sharks lived longer than all the caller animals.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Sovbes RF.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, by decree, amended the composition of the RF Security Council, reported the Kremlin press service.
Previously, it was known that Putin had withdrawn from office President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration, who was succeeded by Anton Wyno.
Ivanov will now be a special representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
The Council's deputy Rashid Nurgaliyev was expelled from the permanent members of the B.B.F.
The board includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Wyno, half-preacher of the President in the SFO, Sergei Minylo, and half-predre in the SZFO by Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been released from his position as Chief of Administration of the President.
By decree, President Sergei Ivanov was released from office as manager of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov is appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental Affairs, Environment and Transport.
Anton Wyno, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov, was appointed new manager of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer to another job.
Should we go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor at the Olga Bogus Sanatorium.
And if he's healthy, he's tired of his job, should he go to the sanatorium?
Rest is needed not only for treatment but also for the prevention of disease.
In sanatorium conditions, a person can check the condition of his body and obtain advice from a doctor on how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be too much for anyone.
- Just tired of work - it's an important signal to the body, it's not worth turning away from.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is around 90% of those coming.
Most vulnerable to it are people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest on time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people lower their biological age while staying in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend time with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
Health programmes for children, even the youngest, include diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children ' s basins), inhalations, special diets, massages, oxygen cocktails, and curable physical activity.
The procedure course shall be determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual testimony and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, a children ' s club is usually in sanatoriums with animators, where children can attend play classes, and various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the necessary facilities and services to the experienced nanny.
The mild winters, long summers, over-drinking days of the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not just in the summer.
So the weather behind the window should not be feared, especially since most procedures are indoors and are not season-dependent.
Generally, sanatorium treatment is two times a year, especially for people of advanced age.
The main target of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, curative mineral sources: Slavonic, Smirnovsky, Essentukki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect the body’s various systems.
Water varies in temperature, quantity of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's feelings.
Narzan, for example, has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulative effect, restores the gastrointestinal tract and exchange of substances.
“Essentuki - 4 - affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the sugar level.
The new Essentials has an anti-inflammation, yellow and urination effect.
Water - Slavonic -
In water assignment, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because salts delay fluid, resulting in higher pressure.
The acceptance of mineral water requires a regime: water should be drank at a certain time, at the right amount and at a specific temperature.
The sanatoriums are now accessible and various cosmetic procedures are available to the person and the body.
What types of recovery based on the natural features of the North Caucasus are available at the resorts of the region?
Close to Pätigorsk, for example, is the salty Lake Tambukan, the illum of which is useful to joints, to the vertebrae, to the internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effect.
It's a healthy walk along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kizlovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the Narzan mineral source
And you can also take baths that are guilty, pearly, kindred, selenium, balfay-lacry, depending on what your doctor wants you to do.
Longer fruitfulness.
What can we do to keep the harvest going by the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuhova, the agrone and the daughter.
It's time for high-growing tomatoes to make a haircut: to remove new pasties, to cut the monkeys, to remove all the leaves to the pendant bones with fruits and flowers with small bonds -- not to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of constitutionality - as well as peppers and eggplants, by sub-feeding a poly-superphosphate extract, by processing biopreparates (Foreigner - for expediting the tide and growing fruit, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamayir, Bactophyte - from diseases, Immunocytophyt - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, Fytowerm - if there are pests).
In late summer, only copper domes, colloid sulphur, and green soap should be used.
Let's do the last flood of plants.
In the heat, long-flavored cucumbers are released from the wallpaper so that the lower, nude part of the stalk (25-40 cm) will lie on the ground with warm water and a Zircon solution, sipping the stalk with 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to extend the fruit of the cod, such as cutting old leaves, pouring warm water, and a solution of integrated fertilizers, to dip the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against nighttime colds, set an arc above it with cover material.
Keep the plants open by day, and close the sun after sunset.
The marks of the end.
What indicates Russia getting out of crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia leaving the longest recession in 20 years.
According to the Bloomberg Analysts, RF GDP shows a positive development - in the second quarter of GDP, it fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed down to 0.6 per cent.
The Central Bank and Minsk Development have also recently expressed their stabilization.
The front is slow growth.
In the opinion of the experts of the CBD, the recession in the Russian economy has remained the case.
- Indexed estimates of Russian GDP indicate that recession has remained behind and that the economy has slow growth ahead - says the Bank of Russia bulletin - What trends say -
The adjustment of GDP for the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of Mineconom development, during the second quarter of the year, the Russian Federation’s GDP declined by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasoned GDP decline was 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent and in May and June GDP was within 0-0.15- - quoted by the IER representative RIA-Noves -
The slowing down of the Russian economy in the last five quarters shows that one thing has been done -
Bloomberg refers to the rising demand for electricity and rail transport and business recovery as other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery.
If an adjustment is made to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the change in plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption may be halved by an additional working day.
Add the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it's difficult to get accurate data, and the plus minus 0.5 per cent of annual volume can also be explained in seasonality -- explained by Cyril Jacobenko of ALOR BROKER.
There are, however, other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat, has been deflation.
Prices in Russia dropped for the first time in five years.
A 12 per cent increase in the rate of rouble, albeit with strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has been achieved since August, as a result of the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that must be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy - it stresses Jacobenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
External trade is falling from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, with unemployment rates falling to 5.4 per cent, is also showing positive developments.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the real incomes of the population were left behind.
In annual terms, the rate drops by 4.8 per cent.
This may impede economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
In general, their share is more than 50% in the structure of the economy.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia also has a strong policy as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator retains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which has no better impact on the real sector.
A negative factor is also inadequate investment, which hampers industrial capacity development.
But by the end of the year, it can be assumed that the rate of decline of the RF economy will slow to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015 - an analyst at the HC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalizing athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well - meaning winter sports in Sochi Olympics, has not been so actively developed in summer sports.
While in the Rio Games for Russia and for former foreigners, the majority of these are former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio, we can see the reverse of the process -- a fairly large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Some parents have been taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone has failed to compete for a seat in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that abroad, better conditions would be created for development in sport.
AF.ru. has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian nationality.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Red.
But before, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister's footsteps to take up athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
She would hardly have been able to rise from the throne, Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, in the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countryman, though former, in the sixth-year leap sector.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the 2010 European bronze and the 2016 continental silver, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayev.
29-year-old Elena Pyrozhkova was born in Novosnecka in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
A lot because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children were raised in the family.
They all lived in a small town called Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena was starting to get involved in a fight back at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the U.S. Center for Training under the leadership of another former Russianman, Vladislav Izbonikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first capture.
But at the World Cup that year, it's a victory.
Before that, she had, by the way, won silver at the 2010 world front.
This was followed by bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
Twenty-six-year-old Maria was born in the town of Jaroslavla, where she first met a synchronous voyage.
But to say she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
Maria continued her classes there.
Soon she was part of the United States and was showing excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronizers cannot compete, but for America its ceilings are.
The new name, which is said strangely by Russian, Christina Shaldybin was given at 11 when her parents decided to continue teaching her artistic gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Before that, the girl had been in her favorite sport at Jaroslavla.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly joined the country ' s male congregation and later broke into the main national team.
In the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Christian won gold and silver.
The first position on the world stage, of course, she didn't have to fight, but for the U.S., she organized a real breakthrough -- she brought the star-band assembly to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our ex-boyfriends is Jana Berezco-Marggrander, who is in favour of German assembly.
She was born in Tolietta.
In 2008, when the girl was 13, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had a greater chance of getting to the national assembly.
Soon she had represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
It was true that she was able to take only 17 seats, not enough to get into the final competition in her personal pre-eminence.
But two years earlier, she had succeeded in winning the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, male.
Another gymnast, this time the sport is Irina Sazonov.
If the ways of emigrating the above mentioned athletes can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is being trained in Russia, but she is on her way to her homeland in order not to lose her skill.
At Rio, she did not speak as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal lot.
There is very little evidence of Mary Ogolawa's spitting in the Russian information space.
For a long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results, even the country's record 200 metres away as a battery.
In 2015, she became a Swiss national and stood under a red and white flag.
At Rio, her best performance is 14 times 4x100.
In order to get into the game, a girl launched a crowdsourcing project that allowed her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter, Adam Batyrov, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasawurta was able to become a threefold primer of European champions, Russian champions, and Russian sports master of the international class.
When he stopped coming into our national assembly, it was time to reflect on the change of nationality.
For several years, a talented fighter has disappeared from sports matches.
The Triumphal return was held at the 2016 Asian Champion, Batyrov, who had already been represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another foreign countryman, Michael Dvanov, is even less familiar with his home than even the Swiss fisher Maria Ogolkowa.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started to do sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, it was the best as a 40-place in a parallel bar.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her classes by synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl in the Berlin champion of Europe took 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was five in a solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croyter is in favour of a composite Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
At the age of 17, Dmitri was already the champion of the country.
That same year he won the Youth World Cup.
One year later, Croiter wins the gold of Singapore's young Olympics.
In addition to jumps at altitude, Dmitri engages in pins in length and a triple pin.
A 31-year-old Albert is another Hasavürt, who decided to change his sports nationality after making long speeches for Russia.
Unlike Batyrov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he advocated the Krasnoirska High Sports School, even becoming the national champion in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in a family player in the Soviet Assembly on Jaroslav Antonov's volleyball.
A year before his son Jaroslav was born, he was recognized as the best volleybolist on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family stayed for permanent residence.
In 2015, he joined the national team as a bronze printer for Europe, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the midst of war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the original target, but it was not possible to enter that northern country, having to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to study the struggle.
Soon he won the world's primacy among the juniors and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
At Rio, he will be the only representative of France on the fight tournament.
And again, the struggle, and again, the former Russian.
This time we're talking about a North Ossetian woman who emigrated to Spain, Timuras Freyev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is now in favour of his team.
Prior to that, a 30-year-old athlete had also experienced high results in Russia.
It became a bronze prize for the national champions of 2007 and 2008.
The Charter of Notable Assembly decided to change sports citizenship.
The last box on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital, Dagestan Mahachale, Arthur Biarslanov.
When he was ten years old, his parents took his family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has become Canada’s champion three times and became a world champion for young people in 2012.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first of its new homeland since 1975.

Why do kids say classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, “it is not by actions and parades that they need to be brought up, but by systemic means —
They must grow up and at least 7 years of age realize that they are fairy tales and education must be telling.
But as long as this job seems to me to be done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If speaking classes take on all the positives that have been accumulated in the past at a qualitatively new level, I'll be glad.
If everyone else is up and down and you don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
JKK continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is an encroachment on public funds from different levels of budgets.
According to the General Prosecutor ' s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of JCS.
As a result, consumers in the region have paid more than 170 million roubles to the energy sector.
In the days and the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar region, the inclusion of undue costs in tariffs has been revealed.
And the costs of the GLO-IV consulting (cold water supply) were set at £4 million for rental of vehicles at a price higher than the market price.
And these are examples by country of mass.
According to Minstraya RF, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Penal Code, namely, raster, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the version of the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was involved in the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs and was not actually employed but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money.
And as the U.K. master, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, there are millions of roubles in the budget and in the housing sector.
Makarov's machinations scheme, which is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the KK, who paid the money to the citizens.
The trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is ongoing in Kamchatka, and is also a former member of the councillor, who is charged with fraud on 91.7 million roubles.
According to a version of the investigation, in 2012-2013, Elizovo Kamchatsky established 6 company managers and established 3 limited-responsibility societies.
One of them did the contracting work, the other two played the role of the cash centres, i.e. the money of the population.
But A. Kohan's energy did not list the funds but spent the money he loved.
Judging in the area of JCS is difficult.
Things don't get excited, they're prolonged.
And - in this highly confusing housing legislation - Svetlana Dissolve, executive director of NPC -
We don't have one law to earn, as we come up with a new one to force the previous one to work.
There are few specialists, including judges, in the case of JCS.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing rights in institutions.
Denial of criminal prosecutions, the Vulture in the course of investigations, is also reported in the General Prosecutor's Office.
Of the 35,000 crimes currently in production, less than half are committed.
The rest of the investigation was lengthy and each fifth suspended due to the failure to establish the accused.
Often, shortcomings in law enforcement activities are attributable to gaps in the legislation in force.
There is a law, but the investigative authorities are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting, and only 60 criminal cases were opened.
The number has only increased slightly over the five months of the current year, 99.
What, though, is the falsification of the housing record?
This means that changes in house management, financial and other matters bypass the views of the owners.
And that also means that the housing and communal services market cannot be entered into by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than to reach the population.
Residents in the miniuse, small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Committee on Property, is confident.
This work is now under way.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals do not smell in the capital.
Why are there no JKKX scandals in Moscow, as in many other regions?
Yes, because of the iron will and order of the capital government, he told AIF-Anatoly Elected, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I am referring to both human resources and legislative amendments and legal education.
Management companies have been closely monitored and all licensed.
The complaints of the citizens are resolved promptly in public space (and the appeals of the residents and the response is posted on the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Instead of simply paying for monthly receipts, many carefully observe what is written there as to how the house is kept.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and the obligations of the resource providers and managers of organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow verifies the validity of the housing and community service tariffs, as much of the budget goes for subsidies and benefits for many sectors of the population.
It's probably all together, and it explains the calm atmosphere in Moscow.
Turns out, everything is in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you'd have to change the place of work if you weren't willing?
Turkish gambit.
Could Erdogan abandon his friendship with the EU and the United States?
President Recep Taipe Erdogan of Turkey proposed an ultimatum to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gullen, an Islamic preacher charged with organizing a coup d'état.
He spoke to his supporters in Ankara about this.
Erdogan called on the Americans to abandon their support - the terrorist organization fethullahist -
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the United States to change its position.
The experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO-Terrorist organization of the Fethullahists.
Either the FETO coup d'état or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice - the Anatolian Agency for Erdogan’s appeal was quoted on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey has once again but has already taken a tougher turn to the United States to comply with his demand, which he announced for the first time in the aftermath of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of 16 July, the Turkish army, in Turkey, attempted to overthrow the legitimate authorities in the country and attempted the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regrep Erdogan appealed to the population, the rebellion was suppressed and his organizers and participants arrested.
Some 8,000 people have been suspected, including teachers and scientists, besides the military.
Recep Erdogan is of the opinion that his mentor was Fethullah Güllen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that Americans could be involved in the coup d'état.
The Panel recommends no compensation for loss of profits.
The last statement of the representatives of Gosdepa on this occasion was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey from insisting on his own and also demanding other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not call the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens” the Minister of Turkey for the EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, announced on 9 August.
He said that the amendment of the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Let us note that on 1 August, the Vice Chancellor of Germany, Zigmar Gabriel, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open the border to migrants in order to facilitate visa treatment with the EU.
His words were the response to a statement made by Mevluta Chavushoglu, head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made on the past Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish MID did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere was not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defence sphere, they import missiles,” said Chavushoglu in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“ To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with the NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others,” said the Minister.
The experts believe that this is all about Turkey's serious differences with the West and the country's reorientation towards the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Eugeny Minchenko, believes that Regcep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot take a hard confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do in the West, in terms of business, and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Although, of course, Americans would be more comfortable in this post as a fully obedient person -- explained AI.ru to the expert.
He said that it was possible, following statements by the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensations, demand for a secure space with Europe and extradition from the United States) that he would be pressured.
“Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with America and with the EU, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial methods of governance, and so on” says Minchenko.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexey Muhin, suggests that the President of Turkey is changing his view of Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strong stand against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
When he finds himself between two poles, West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, which is what Muchin believes.
In his view, the primary challenge for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, which requires Russia and its partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Guulina.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which, through it, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The expert considers that consensus with Turkey will be achieved.
In other words, the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazov, is of the view.
Now, Turkey's relationship with the EU and the US is tense enough, especially Erdogan's domestic policy.
I think that this crisis will worsen, and against the backdrop of the crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to re-load policies in both the Middle East and Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claims that they are willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, settle their relations with Israel, and engage actively in political engagement with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glazov, suggesting that Erdogan would be the next step in normalizing relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy currently pursued by Erdogan was a return to the foreign policy course followed by Turkey prior to the beginning of the Arab revolution.
- At the time, at the position - zero problems with the neighbours - Turkey had begun to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The President of Turkey has now made very successful visits to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the regional and international positions of Turkey, the expert considers.
It is the view that returning Turkey to its former relationship with the EU will be extremely difficult, and it is now more likely that the EU will respond harshly to Turkey, which can open the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Strike Junior Physicians: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize further collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers had not been able to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It rejected 58 per cent of its members who had participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members, published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to keep quiet about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the Government's silence, the head of JDC now made a formal request to an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to endorse a continuing programme of collective protests beginning in early September.
Resistance led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The lead of BMA junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malvana, resigned after the vote to abolish the agreed working conditions recommended by BMA.
He told the BMA members that the deal was good to be accepted during the pre-election meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: “Alyans is bad”
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague at the gilded palace of St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation.
It was handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked heavy, and he hardly emitted heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Taipe Erdogan, in contrast, spoke repeatedly of his dear friend, Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my bill.
He also promised that his relationship with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described the actions of Mr. Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the prolonged cold that came from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first to be mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was inviolable.
Mr. Putin was angered by an angry tyrad, accusing Ankara of being hit by Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more intense, based on a supposed friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months the State-controlled media carried out a stupendous, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had attacked the illegal oil trade from the Syrian-controlled areas of the so-called Islamic State.
He denied that strongly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, the meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received an apology that he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the advantages of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrowed from his post last month in an attempt at a coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey left him shocked, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely struck — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, the tour operators and charter companies, of course, find relief when the flights finally resume.
They set on the peak of the end of the Mediterranean season.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
The tourists, the tomatoes, back here, as reported in the newspaper News.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West for what she considers to be a weak response to an attempt at a coup.
Add her lingering frustration to the soaring pace of EU accession talk and Mr. Putin’s step — who seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonuses with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup d ' état.
Remember, this is for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described as the Alains of the Bad - the two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently stood as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, whereas Mr. Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language across Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member is hit by a Russian jet fighter — it is better that the two leaders speak at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be upgraded to be a back office, according to the Bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told Scotland BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and must have been saved.
During this period brand strategy was used by RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsored international sport, from the Six Nations Cup on rugby to the Wimbledon Champion, Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was appropriate to allow more national brands to take priority.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking services to individuals who will get more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC of Scotland, \"The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and our staff, because we are now becoming more brand bank --
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its own population, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not be possible to continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it was increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
- It's a good time for us to move the brand bank, because in the basic (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers, the executive director said.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all those brands.
But with the work we did focusing on customer needs rather than on our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time to do it.
Frankie Detours returns to 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket on Passion
Detachtors spraying champagne after a duplicate in Newmarket brings it to 3,000 wins
Frankie Detori's jockey won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark by means of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Passion, trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth leaps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idderi, and Willie Carson.
The three-fold jockey Children, who had previously won the Ghayar, said: “It's something special...
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's the usual Friday night since 20000.
I'm free from business, and I'm very uncompressed.
Children accept applause when they bring about Preposition after victory
Two jockeys reached this mark in leaping obstacles: Richard Johnson's jockey champion and Sir Anthony McCoy, a retired 20-fold champion, who had over 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but he's the tactile person who distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He's a great jumping representative, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Eps, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekends and big leaps!
And if it's serious, Frankie brought the winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character who's good for British leaps, but he's also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Detori celebrated this outstanding mark with a horse-throwing firm
From quick fins to fast jumps, Frankie Dettors has been a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
They were takeoff and fall.
Lots of big jump winners, including his famous Great Seven, in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the air crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed great will to challenge the skeptics and to return to shape.
And he may not have finished for some time - the Children said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Putin fired Sergei Ivanov's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s trust circle for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed by the Environment and Transport Representative.
A statement from Kremlin stated that Putin’s decision to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President — but did not give any reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanov, since 2012, Anton Wyno, has been appointed successor.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
He was later the head of the Government ' s protocol to the President and the Government apparatus, reporting the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At his appointment he said to Putin: “Thanks for your trust.
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had requested his release from his position and had recommended that Vineo replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
That's the move that has made Moscow feel bad.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on State television, both men stated that the Chief Executive had resigned at his own request.
Despite smiles on the camera, it has convinced few here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that a person for whom he was once agitating as a potential president — suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policies — was met with enormous skepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to trust me with this very complex post, even, perhaps, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He used to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as well as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five most trusted men.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become Russian President after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would be in conflict with the Constitution.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, took the position.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency just three and a half years later.
The star of the show - think like a criminal - Thomas Gibson fired after a producer fight
Gibson was a member of the L.A. show survey last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios that produce TV series announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in surveys and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened,” he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show following the FBI agents' team are expected to arrive later, as stated by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who used to play a major role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“ I love — to think as a criminal — and to put my heart and soul in him during the last twelve years — ” said Gibson in his Friday statement.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the screenwriters, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans that the show could have dreamt of.
It is estimated that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Puzzle: fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banfa sought help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sands left behind by water stink.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, photographed this sight in Periscop in the hope that anyone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-foot-old fish.
Quinsferri Crossing: Bridge is now connected to Faif
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north pass and the viaduct Quinsferri Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
This is the first of four links between the webs of the canvas - which are now near the completion of all three pieces of the bridge.
The bridge section from Faif is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vans of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, \"It's a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinspheri Crossing.
We are all witnesses to the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79 percent of the total bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete coating is being poured into Rostati today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions Project, said, \"The first junction on every bridge project is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, it is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road canvas and connecting it to the expanding North Pilot road canvas, we were left to close the remaining curtain on the northern side, or the side facing the shore.
This has been done by prolonging the North Approach education by 700 millimetres south.
It was a massive, yet highly sophisticated operation.
A massive viaduct weighing about 6,000 tons 222 metres long, was to be raised to the slope angle of about 3 per cent.
Expensive because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny — only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Saved in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men's' lucky to stay alive.
Three men are lucky to stay alive after being thrown out of the fishing vessel in Anglsey.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue station raised an alarm at 13:20 a.m. on Friday night after the team saw an incident in the Bay of Moelf.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place while their boat continued its course.
“ We saw their ship circle around them and assume the worst, ” said Moelfre Jones, the steering lifeboat.
Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them — he added.
Two men were rescued by means of a local fishing vessel, and a third man for 60 years was found exhausted and trapped in a buoy without a life jacket.
All were raised on board the shoreboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, \"The three men thrown into the water are lucky they're alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency unlocker, but it somehow pulled away from the man who was driving the boat when it came across.
Someone's been watching over these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's fun to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go outside to play in order to spend their free time watching the screens was a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokémon Go takes people away from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time in the screen was originally limited to television, video games, and more recently smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the full appeal of Pokémon Go, is based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the result of a series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, this has lost its relevance somewhat earlier than this new game was made available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at that time was delayed due to the massive response that the servers had overloaded.
There were more users in Pokémon Go than Tinder and almost as many days as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players go looking for Pokémons that are tracked over GPS, and being detected, they can be \"photographed\" (through a screen shot on your phone) or \"tilled\".
The generation that played the game, as a young man, joined in a slow attraction, breaking off the couches to find out.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken — usually — by the person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that monitors 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of starting a game, the number of people being tracked, who performed 30 minutes daily, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level data.
Many health campaigns that persuade people - 30 minutes - to get out of the couch - and to be active every day - have not been answered because most health messages are boring and speak to people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages that is too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
The three pillars of health are therefore covered: movement, fresh air, sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends.
As usual, there are boring nudes who are looking for things to complain about.
And yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though the smartphones' apps like Fitbit could still track our physical activity before, they didn't give us any excuse for doing things like playing this game.
The news will be here, and the use will be weakened over time.
But due to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simona Byles wins the gold of absolute primacy in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the pummel.
Simona Byles is not committed to all this.
Dynamic on the support jump.
Unforced on a log.
It's on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now finally, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of the final champion on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the close attention of the Olympics.
Her general score of 62.198 was sufficiently away from silver medallism and teammate - Final Five - Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medallist Alia Mustafin.
Byles, from the United States, speaks in a gymnastics log during the finals of the women's individual absolute primacy on artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byls became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of the absolute prime champion and fifth in general, enshrining her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly at any time.
She grew up showing her final total and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts it in the same league as rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Byles had spent the last three years dominating his sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup - including 10 gold - with such stunning programmes in their mixture of labour-loving and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called it the greatest gymnast I have ever seen -
One final test was in Brazil, not so much between Byles and the others in this area as between her and her load of over-estimated expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an undue expectation.
Simona Byles of the United States, on the left, and Ali Reisman are hugged after winning gold and silver respectively in the finals of women's individual absolute primacy on artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a farewell party, the retired coordinator of Martha Caroly's National Assembly.
While Byles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her hallway, is set up for Latin American music, which would fit right outside the Rio Olympics on the street.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a startling child, opened by the mother of coach Amy Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost any competition since summer 2013 at the top of an absolute race — a strip that has to last for as long as Bails wants it.
In spite of Mustaffin's little advantage with two transformations, it was mirage.
The gymnastics and free exercise — where Bales defends the title of the world champion — is at stake.
She went back from 15.433 on the log to 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account — a clean formality — and tears appeared around the brilliant red with white and blue byles eye pads, when she had intended to write in an album for cutting.
Reisman's performance was a little revenge four years ago when she shared a third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina on the Thai breech.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom Americans call a grandmother, was well ahead of him.
She sent a kiss to the crowd after her leisure exercise, which was sometimes called into question.
With regard to Byles, the viral tweet 19 years from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on Finix's first serial killer in the last decade, were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports issued on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis, and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, the authorities said.
The offender fired approximately eight pistol shots from the passenger side of the car, after which he disappeared on another vehicle, reported.
The police state that the triple murder does not appear to be the result of the robbery, since the attacker has not taken the purse or $2,900 that was held by an adult victim.
Police spokesman Finix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the firing had led investigators to check if he had been involved with the previous four attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
“ This happens in the residential area in front of the house, ” said Howard KPHO, a branch office of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter Malia, died on the ground.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and was believed to have been the case with a serial killer.
The investigators found the gilts and took the bullet out of the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
A mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalus:
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Picclisto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephalus was the result of a genetic violation that his mother, Elisabeth Piccisito, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for it.
What's not really true is, of course, you subscribe to it, she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized care facility.
“ My first answer was, ‘ I didn’t think people were doing this yet, ’ ” explained Piccistto.
Edmund walks by walking.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he turned three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund designed for \"please sing to me\"
“ We teach him sign language ” said Piccito CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language — she says Edmund has developed his own gestures.
Microcephalia can result from a number of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as Edmund, during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and projections may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it's going to affect the lives of those infected with Zik's virus.
Piccicito remembers emotional loss because of an uncertain future.
I told you all the time what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Piccicito has some encouraging advice for mothers of babies with congenital defects because of Zik.
It's gonna get better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding causes rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected to take place over the State until Saturday inclusive.
The National Meteorological Service reported numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and southern Mississippi leaving the shores and threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall.
Governor John Bell Edwards of Louisiana said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected arrivals.
Mike Steele, a representative of the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Office of the Governor, said that requests for high-water, boat and sandbags were being received.
Steele said that it was not until Tanjipahoa that had requested tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains until Saturday on most of the southern part of Louisiana.
The weather service said in the statement that an additional three to five inches [3 to 5 inches] could swoop into the area.
In southern Alabama, the maintenance of the flood continued until Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobil area.
The Kamit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, was predicted to set the flood record last weekend.
The synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flood flowing downstream at Assenshen’s arrival was a threat, as those upswing rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded levels at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the floods in Amit and Wilkinson counties in south-west Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and pasties were among the saved early Friday night at Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the Bever Creek waters, which are usually over 400 feet from his house, quickly rose in the night.
He said that another passerby who lives nearby had warned him.
“ We woke up, and the water kept coming, ” said Hansford.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that this was the largest tributary she had ever seen in 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued all three by means of an army truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where they hid on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood - is spreading rapidly - as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an observer near Livingstone reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was over-saturated by rainfall from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have resulted in work to save residents from homes in the arrival of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in the five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, a branch office of CBS, reports that Counsel Tanjipahoa described 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now sinking.
The Chairman of the Arrival, Robbie Miller, said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven high-water domestic animals.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
- They'll have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to retreat, he said.
In Hammond, the arrival of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“ The last major flood we had was March, ” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the road to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the heavy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been registered as flooded on Thursday, but not one had been registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, manager of Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
- I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before,' said Tawson, \"and it still pours on the ground...
Mahāj Brown, 6. Depleted by the bullets, remains alive after the Filadelfía shooting
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia by a police officer registering a second shooting in a six-year-old town this week.
Grandmother and grandfather of the child identified him for CBS. Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather are told, Brown sustained numerous fire wounds, including his arm, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious of being taken to hospital.
- He got quite well, his little body was exposed to bullets, - says his grandmother Delírez Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical hospital and has experienced several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to get better.
He was supposed to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in a block by Germantown.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting the station.
Two other casualties were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
Investigators report to CBS that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed men.
“Flashes from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, have caught the scene.
I think that was definitely a long battle.
There were gulls on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
So it seems that there were a few armed fighters there and that they were actively involved in the shooting - the station was informed by Captain Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Jinaldi.
Many homes and cars in the zone have also been shut down.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly watching video surveillance cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the hand with a steel bullet Tuesday when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call the Women's Olympic Engraving on Gymnastics this year and for several reasons.
First, I've been on every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this gathering: Simon Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Lorie Hernández, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this gathering, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is a Jewish woman, and Madison Cochan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
That's what this collection looks like, finally, like America.
This has also strengthened the female Black and Latin American presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast had been African-American.
Simon and Gabby last year were Nos. 1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
On the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold Peace Champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Lori Hernández performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuosoal gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row, winning gold in women's individual absolute primacy.
And Alie Reisman, a teammate, earned his silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this type of sport, but it does not look that way in the gymnastics sections all over the country.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic Assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic Gymnastics team will have only four gymnastics on the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroly's training.
But in reality, gymnastics is a expensive sport, and gymnastics are initially trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying for the cost of education, equipment, travel, form, participation fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnastics get everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term responsibility for the families of the gymnastics.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Byles, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Hernández, both trained their athletes from the moment they took up gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and accessible training of gymnastics to the communities of small numbers of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mainly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnasticism develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the resilience to weariness, discipline and persistence of the mind.
This combination has a positive effect on good health, school success and work throughout the life cycle.
It is the inspiration of this gathering that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, which is beautiful.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
It's a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Ali, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The medical assistants were engaged to announce further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on no-one's land, and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first medical assistants have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working hours during the night and weekends to improve services during off-time.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement yesterday night: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There was only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors were transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time was given.
WMATA's attempt to resolve the dispute was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes a total silence on the part of the Government.
And it's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
- Jeremy Hunte needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are clear that they are ready to organize further strikes.
The last cup in late April delayed approximately 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to ensure that doctors were replaced on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to an amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payment for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue to strike.
Mortimer said: \"Flashes reach little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services that are already working at the forefront, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families \"
During the past two months, we have talked to the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, flexibility of education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, cost of training, mutual recognition of curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in pay in medicine — was an indication of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the terms of the WMA in November, February and May.
£2 per day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are about to take a medication of £2 a day after the authorities have recommended that more people be given it and for longer periods of time.
The antiretrovir drug reduces the risk of repeated attacks on people with heart disease.
The drug has already been appointed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service has been advising that it be given to the people for four years to continue avoiding the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE surveillance service of the British National Health Service has now asked to be given to the people for four years to continue avoiding the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs to about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and from the formation of plaques.
If the bladder breaks apart, it can cause a plate that blocks the blood’s access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the plate moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the flow of blood to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who are already faced with one attack are at greater risk of receiving another.
The ticogrlor produced by the British firm AstraZeneca, sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making troms less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelora for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE Medical Technology Evaluation, said: “Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of those who have had a heart attack, there will be another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences —
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
There is evidence that chicaglora, combined with aspirin effects, can reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
While recommending chicaglor, we are happy to be able to increase the options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the thicaglora — especially the risk of bleeding — has been limited beyond three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for longer periods of time.
PC ownership culture allows for the flourishing of falsifications of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving the Government's report.
A culture of political readiness has resulted in the closing of the eyes, which has resulted in widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to the devastating report of the Government issued today.
Former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Picles criticizes the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of electoral violations because of the excessive sensitivity to race and religion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The former Secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police should be allowed to draw borders outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters accept identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting unwashed ink on people's fingers when they issue their bulletins to exclude anyone from voting twice.
Better protection should be provided to informants, said Sir Eric.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is not only done to protect yourself from fraud in elections, but also to protect the local Government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it by hand” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters ruled that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman cinically distorted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have carried out his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the believing Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or have been the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photos, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring that you bring your identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: “Provided evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of seniors, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... State institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of political readjustment to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from voting ballots to stop the harvest of votes -
The report, at the time of the consideration of Theresa May, also calls for strict registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is under consideration to require that a identity card be presented before voting.
Use unwashed ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people ' s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on automatic mail voting applications.
Dispose of campaign political actors and activists from working with filled-in ballots and post-vote envelopes.
To empower the police to establish borders around polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the charge of intimidation against people under the National Act of 1983.
Take illegal photography at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff force the vote to go into the box one at a time.
Sir Eric attacked the city police bitterly, claiming it was amazing that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts” he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the ineffective check-in for the check-in for the check-in-the-point division of city administrations.
Sir Eric stated: “The final ruling of the trial in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as a mother of parliamentary elections, but the alarming and subtle spread of electoral fraud and denial by some bodies threatens this good reputation.
Cate and other double-mindeds of the Rio Olympics who are insane
The 2016 Olympics, in Rio, went crazy this week on a French cyclist, Pauline Ferran Prévo, who turned out to be an impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic player is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who may boast his own famous double - at least according to reports in social media.
So, in honour of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens to date, F.S.E. has created a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: The member of Brady Allison, a male team of U.S. archers, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Besides Kate's twin on a bicycle track, many people online have hurried to point out how a particular hole might be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
Brady Allison, a member of a male team of U.S. archers, was the cause of a storm in Twitter, after his images, which looked frighteningly similar to Volstreet's star, came into existence.
And in fact, the lunatic learned about the social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“ I personally don’t see a huge similarity, maybe with the exception of vegetation on my face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
- He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment -
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between the British pragon Greg Roserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian hymnast Alia Mustafina, with her very strong eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
And in the southern African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: this user believes that Nathan is the \"spoofing version\" of the actor \"Start\"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast like heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medallist of Russia, Julius Efimov, is not only capable of boasting the same burnt skin and light hair as AnnaLinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, fans say, looks like Joseph Gorgon Levitt's \"spoofing version\"
Raw women: Houp Solo football star on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creation theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this couple's appearance is similar.
One Twitter user has recently approached the site to make public his assailant that the \"last Internet\" thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical --
Actually, U.S. football star and Dexter actress have incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of an actress, Laura Linnie, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas, who can boast her own beautiful, broad smile, which looks like a smile of a star. - Good luck, Gabriel Union.
CBC’s commentator Olympics apologizes for speaking of China’s dead swimmer as a pig —
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth seat at 14-year-old Ay Yanghang on the women's relay with a freestyle of 4x200 metres disheartened CBC viewers on the Olympics live broadcast
The CBC, a Canadian broadcaster, was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese sawman had started out like a fire and a dead pig during the bay.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his microphone was shut down when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's estrangement of 4x200 metres free.
You could hear McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC team of commentators to get her out of color, said, \"This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.\"
He's too excited, he's running like a warrior, he's dead like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese sawman Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, sailed the second stage of the estaphet for 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canada’s Taylor Cancer — allowing Canadians to remove China’s lag.
People across Canada reacted quickly online after they were shaken by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: \"Is the CBC dictator really just saying that a 14-year-old bird from China is dead like a pig?\"??
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.
About Ai Yanghang from China at the end of the 4x200-foot women's estaph said: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese woman threw out a ball, baby --
The criticism of Twitter immediately struck Byron McDonald, many urging him to fire.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard Byron McDonald was insensitive.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Nobody ever does anything to himself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who had been transmitting the CBC, apologized on direct air for McDonald's comment, saying, \"We apologize for the comment made on the flight flight.
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
Commentor receiver Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The TV has also hurried to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to go on air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our audience on live air and our subscribers on social media.
Let's make it clear, Byron's comments were about being a catcher, not being a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron very much regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think that his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I'd like to use the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said at the CBC Olympics.
'I've talked about being a pimp, not her in person.'
'Same to mean no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
The buyer of Pricmark insulted a woman who used her underwear in the middle of the store without tingling.
Buyers didn't know where to look when a woman got naked to put underwear on the floor with stores in the middle of Premark.
Which is even worse, she put in the way she looked in them, pulled them down, and put them back on the regiment.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place Shop in Folkstone.
Bouverie Place shopping store in Folkstone, where a woman used truncating pancakes before putting them back on the stick
The mother of two Jenny Davidson's children, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of underwear, the mysterious woman had once again dressed and left the store without buying anything.
She said, \"People couldn't believe what they saw.
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a couple of chickens out of the cane, took her own panties and pants, and put them on.
- She didn't try to find a place where she could do it - she just stood there in shame-
Everyone stood up when she took off her pants again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the stick.
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here she liked, dressed again, and walked out.
It doesn't look like she was being taken care of, who was watching her, or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy those underwear that she was following.
A 33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, \"It's not good to think that someone's going to take home the underwear that someone else has worn, and they haven't been pasted.\"
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after they left — and better —
- I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's rabbits and find out what the other woman did and took them off, and they weren't dusted.
The representative of Pricmark reported: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone store on Tuesday 9 August -
All the goods in question were seized from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks by using a tailor-in-law
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Miracci, the master of the Federation of the Craw-Magh in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers in the immediate distance.
Whether you come to your front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapons.
If you come from behind, according to Mirachi, the first thing you have to do is deploy yourself so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a loose elbow.
Then follow the knee in the scent, and while the attacker bends away from the pain, you twist the gun out of his arms, kick him in the face with the barrel, and step back, holding the gun on him.
For an armed man in front of you, the way he does is to remove his body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun, and turn it out so that the thief cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and hit the attacking fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you step back and aim at it.
Does it sound hard?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does that.
Remember, though, that the safest way out of any robbery — if you are not the master of the tailor - is to hand over your cash.
The traveller, Jan Wright, uses his tongue at the most dirty places in Europe
The British traveller subjected his immune system and a ragged reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of John Wright's travel books, 51, from Saffolk, held a euro note, Cirque Piccadili's perils, a toilet button on the train and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's getting into.
But an experiment to become a film called \"The Guide to Travelling-Lizun on the Inner Force\" has produced some remarkable results.
The thought of licking a flush button on a train that is used by thousands of others may be highly repugnant, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his visit to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about increasing intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the oils brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright was known for the tests on the strength of his gut, traveling the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public rails at the stations to the button of the toilet flush, the task undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In a film he made, he said, \"I've been completely careless ever since I was a child, and I've been pulling a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.\"
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test dab showed a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
In comparison, the hands just washed must be within 60.
But there was a Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick, after its luminometer value was over 4,000, while the hands just washed show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a travel film entitled \"The Guide to Traveller-Lizuna by Internal Force \" , which shows the number of bacteria in different locations, e.g. in toilets
In the film, he said, \"It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet.\"
There's nothing dirty more than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything, 'cause it's amusing.
The Traveler-Lizun Manual on Internal Power was removed with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygenated bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
The Senior Vice President of Valio on snacks, juices, and new categories, Nico Vorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time, could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with an idea-- give the bells to Jan--
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Haqala, who was the film director, added, \"Let's say I would have lost my respect for Jan if he had licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.\"
Of course, some things to Jan were easier to lick, and some were rather tough.
I'm glad we managed to put some of these irons on the tape.
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen bacteria exclusively to the good condition of the stomach and intestine, while 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing oxygenated bacteria added.
The Huligan family destroyed the Saltash, the municipal home of Cornwall, before eviction
The Huligan family left their municipal home with a loss of £50,000 after they were evicted for intimidation of their neighbours.
Tanya Skaldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were expelled from their real estates in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After being forcibly evicted from the real estate, shocked housing cooperatives discovered the site in a state of repair.
Walls were left with shining holes, halves were hidden, debris was scattered across the floor and graffiti was burned.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEway, a settler at Cornwall House, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, \"It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed down because this real estate is probably going to be known as the not-so-good Cornwall aspect.
This family uses a bad fame, and their name is a bad one.
A couple of three sons who lived in the property site from time to time, and the police report that the kingdom of family horror included fights in the street with baseball bats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and barrage.
Skaldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received a warrant for antisocial conduct in June.
Several rooms in the house that could be demolished found old garbage.
Gender boards in the drug-selling house had been torn out
The neighbors say they saw the street fights and called the police regularly.
Cornwall House forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed by neighbours who said that their lives had been turned into a daily hell.
One said, \"They didn't bother anyone.\"
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here, we weren't used to it.
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall House neighborhood team, said that the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the home for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
The musor and the old toys were scattered below the oversize side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Houseing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was a limit, and their actions must have been horrible to her observed neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community had done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and will signal that associative behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three of his sons had lived in the house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the burning houses after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to take away the chests of garbage surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 convoys as well as weights, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skaldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to owning class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that the money was going to pay for her son's tomb, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were packed with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with the rent rules of the premises.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall Police, stated that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message for those who feel that they can behave without charges from the prosecutor, and also from those who are harmed by such conduct,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
In Portugal, tourists came to horror when a low-lying military aircraft almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to get down on the sun were terrified of their lives.
P-3C Orion Portuguese Air Force flew extremely low
The Air Force reported that it was performing a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
That's the moment when scared tourists start panicking, while a low-lying plane hits a crowded beach.
A military aircraft was seen on dramatic footage, almost at a distance from hunters on a strip from sand in Aweiro, northern Portugal.
Resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became aware of the noise of the aircraft’s engines but could not see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Cota Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few resters who published a video of a shocking gulf on social media networks, said: \"He flew very low twice, and there was a moment where it seemed to break up at some point.\"
Nuno Arroga added: \"I was surfing and I swear, there was such a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me.\"
Tourists on Aweiro beach were horrified when the plane ran out of fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
Portugal's Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion aircraft had a training flight to locate fishing vessels off the coast, and had to descend as low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft flew slightly lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's Air Force made today a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — thick fog and had been able to make forest fires worse.
The plane performed a training flight, and the pilot was asked to detect fishing boats as part of a task.
The HASSP system has been compulsory for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet been introduced.
Checks are becoming more active, and business is facing fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) - a risk analysis and critical control point - is mandatory for the use of food manufacturers and carriers, as well as common drinking companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Checks of the business by Rossprodnadzor to meet these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
In the meantime, officials issue fines only for certain violations of regulations.
Failure to comply with the regulations will generally cost an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
HASSP, a system that takes into account and prevents the risks of food production, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was then about the safety of the astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food industries not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has operated on TC territory.
The development and implementation of the system in business was four years (the requirement of HASSP was in TC technology in 2011).
Businesses themselves, however, and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of the rule.
Unfortunately, we had long been confident that the rule applied only to food productions and not to repeaters, explained the head of the Helen Cereali Public Council.
Now everyone is trying to top the missing one.
The deadline for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey, the end of August, the beginning of September, is expected.
But the housing demand is not going to cause them, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already preparing for school, experts note.
The travel agency Alliance sent a letter to the Government yesterday asking for a charter now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and availability of marine rest is intractable, since at the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crime, most of the accommodation facilities are already reserved by the end of September — the authors note the letter and stress that opening of charter transport in August will have no significant impact on the demand for Russian maritime goods already established.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), in the event that the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey could be expected within a month.
Clear understanding of when charters will be renewed until now depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft may fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly design programmes and agree with the airlines on the direction of the ships in question,” says Paul Rumens, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but would not have too much effect on the market, because the main buyers of charters -- families with children -- had already returned from vacation and were preparing for school or other vacations.
During the barchat season, the main destinations are single travellers and couples.
Chartered programmes can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously — Paul the Romanians say.
- Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it's going to give a very budget offer -- 50,000-60,000 roubles per tour, because there are people who are waiting for very low-cost tours on purpose -- says Valerie Rosenthal, Director General of Tourism Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, we don't have to expect it to be accurate -- the bulk of the journeys are already planned.
Paul of Romania also believes that since there is a demand for regular trips to Turkey, charters will be sought, but there is no need to wait.
- To Turkey, the launching of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season - - Paul the Romanians say.
The opening of charters in Turkey - positive news for the next season - agrees with Valerie Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NDFL by law of compensation payments within the approved rules for damages caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers employed in hazardous work is provided for in article 222 of the Criminal Code.
In doing so, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by order No. 45n of 16.02.2009 of the Ministry of Health and Development of Russia.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made by workers on days of actual employment in work with hazardous working conditions due to harmful occupational factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these standards, the FNS of Russia, in the letter under review, concluded that, on the basis of paragraph 2 of article 217 of the NFC, the proceeds of milk issued to workers on days of actual employment with hazardous working conditions are exempt from the NDF cover, in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the Ministry of Health (Russian) Order No. 45n of 16.02.2009.
Moscow-Gazstrubank remained without a C.B. license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for banking from a credit organization, the Active Commercial Bank - GASTRAYBANK - registered in Moscow.
The regulator reported that the AKB-GASTRAYBANK had a high-risk credit policy of placing money in low-quality assets.
An adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have given credit to the organization the reasons for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has a temporary administration until the time when it is appointed to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive branch of the lending organization have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
AKB GASTRAYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Law No. 177-FZ on the Insurance of Persons ' Deposits in Banks of the Russian Federation, provides for 100 per cent of the balance of funds but not more than $1.4 million combined on one investor.
Payments, according to the Contributions Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting data, AKB-GASTRAYBANK ' s assets were 335 in the RF banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined IGIL died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join IGIL reportedly died in Syria.
Tasnym Akundi's lawyer claimed that her family had learned of her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqq, a cluster in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave a war - torn country and return to England.
I can only hope that the only advantage of all of this -- like overgrabbing and persuading others that these are the same risks that are involved when traveling to a war zone -- is to get people to make the same choice at any time -- says Akundji.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other East London schoolchildren boarded a plane in Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she married an IGIL fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the office of Supreme Judge if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the Democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominated by Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, but as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reed stated at the conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland - with some degree of confidence -
Representative Reed later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to put Garland on, and he was just building assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to run a boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reed stated that the Republicans who were blocking Garland's nomination were \"inherents\" and \"assistants\" were the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was not suitable for the post.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellmer to produce a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of the exposed celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of open-ended models is different from old-fashioned Playboy, because Playboy is for Men -
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to the display of an eternal and classic naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman’s body,” said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art piece.
Models can send photos online or in private on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will hand out a record of bad Internet motors.
In Moscow, they're going to release a memo that's going to tell you how to avoid being a victim of an Internet engine.
This was reported in Rosprodnadzor, M24.
It is reported that professionals in the department are producing a memo that will help citizens to properly select an Internet store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These would be general information and a legislative framework, rules on the delivery of goods, and ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will contain recommendations on how to properly formulate the claim and so on, as told in Rosprodnadzor.
The monument is being refined to date.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rossprodnadzor website in Moscow and will also release a print version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement calling the name of a second suspect in a diversion organization in Crimea.
Persons from Ukrainian and Russian nationals who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them were Mr. Evgeny Alexandrović and Zachtei Andrey Romanović.
- They all give confessions - they say in the message.
Previously, the resident of Zaporozhye province of Eugeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty to interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has issued an administrative fine for a Google corporation of 438 million roubles, which is listed on the agency's website.
- Google received 438 million roubles for violating antimonopoly legislation.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon,” said the Deputy Head of FAS, Alexei Dazco.
During the investigation, FAS found that Google was supplying smartphone manufacturers who were selling in Russian territory with a Google Play application store only if other corporate applications were installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine to be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of FZZ - On the protection of competition - (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulations will provide an opportunity for competition in the mobile PO market in Russia, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act requires all companies supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations to comply with its products, including the Chief of the Communications and Information Technology Administration of FAS of the Russian Federation.
The authorities suspect of collusion of 16 Russian shops.
The Network New Bookshop was fined for selling the book - 50 days before my suicide -
Shop Network - New Bookshop - Awarded for sale by Stace Kramer - 50 days before my suicide - reports City News Agency - Moscow -
According to Rosprobednadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be considered to be “promoting or motivating the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents” -
The Eastern District Court confirmed violations of the requirements for the dissemination of information to children and ordered the imposition of a fine in the form of confiscation of 49 copies of print products arrested by the Rosproblenadzor Authority.
The source in the New Bookman confirmed that it was Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking the existence of the book - 50 days before my suicide -
There will be a Memorial in Moscow of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, there will be a Memorial of the sculptor Ernst the Unknown, TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literacy House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown One in the United States.
Therefore, it was decided to hold this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their home land, and stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that this was important to the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to attend the evening, including the poet Eugeny Evtushenko, the painter Boris Messerer, President Pashkin Irin Antonov of the GMI, the director of the Ministry of Culture, Marc Rosowski of Russia, Vladimir Midinski of Moscow, the head of the department of culture, Alexander Kibowski, the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Peachnikov.
Previously, it has been reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to have a paniod on the sculptor in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The end consumer blamed: who actually buys the plates?
Lone middle - aged men like to blame.
So long as you haven't been able to put down a section of the commentary with gross insults under the name NévedenyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyjjjjjyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyjjjjjyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyL, this allegation is based on factual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion of plate regeneration is due, not to the boom of a generation of bi-thousands who want to get through the new stuff, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who have recently bought a wine album with a high probability are between 45 and 54 years of age, according to data.
Moreover, those of the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of amateur collecting, it has emotional significance: the older buyers have been guilty of being somewhat more likely to keep their feelings within themselves (56 per cent vs. 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66 per cent).
But are your results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was in the middle of the lively Soho street, in a modest grey suit, and a large gesture before the stop, handcuffing and saying something impressive like, \"Yes, let's see.\"
Okay, let's see.
While Socha's heart slowly loses its charm and its dirt — hotels, cafés, Paperchase shoppers have now taken over buildings once occupied by independent salesmen — several fantastic music stores still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to the different people in some of these shops and try to assess their age and emotional mood through surveillance.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years of age, followed by Sister Ray, two young women, three middle-aged men, to Reckles Records, eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years of age, in London for half a day to meet, and walks around the shops for a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
- I suppose so, he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, shown above (he sent me by e-mail pictures, I didn't chase him to the house), go through the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy plates that he couldn't afford when they just got out and buy the items he sold when he was young and small.
A lot of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy, and he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are likely introverts who like their own company by adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
That's my disadvantage.
Weiss, a 25-year-old who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets match the YouGov profile.
He noted, however, a new wave of people influenced by media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the responsibility to buy their old plates.
Judging from the conversations I had, people have got rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their wine to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their plates, he says.
This may explain the boom among renaissance figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to find out that plastic shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some of the top clients are, among other things, insulted by a cash-free payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel shaken by the digital world and prefer to remove familiar envelopes for plates, objects that awaken memories of a helpless youth.
“ I think sometimes it may be filling up with empty or material things as a kind of calming down, ” says Wez.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think many people do.
It's a simple way to get your head.
- We're like their social workers.
An ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought a wine album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a loser that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy wine did not have a record loser.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking like a busy, lively sledge with Bosanov’s assemblers.
The three-year renaissance aspect is what Johnny, 42, has noticed, who works in the Sounds of the Universe.
“ Someone came back recently and said, ‘ I don’t have a plate loser, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so that we can put a stick on it,’ he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely going to happen.
More of a piece, less of a piece of music.
We have people who say, \"I don't have a record loser.\"
They're younger people who aren't old, they're a little less than 20 who just get to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken away almost the whole floor of vinyl, is a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s who are taking pictures, teenage boys and women in their middle years.
Although the atmosphere is less inviolable than in the above-mentioned shops — the last Sint and sexy pop Wild Best rather than jazz improvisation — it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a 30-second stand next to someone.
Eleanor, aged 27, walked the Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the different plates available on sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending the money.
She didn't earn much, she said, so it wasn't a good option to build plates.
It's worth it.
To listen to music on a computer or another device -- just, but the beauty of guilt -- is -- it plunges into a dream with a breath of breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers guilty of urban fashions.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at the jeans, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crosley loser.
On the left is a ladder whose wall is removed by the plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynehouse and Flintwood Mac: a mixture of modern styles and classics, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one is watching — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real, very, very bad fault.
But given that any attention paid to these items may mean more money for the industry and sending several clients to the Soho depths for a while, hardly anything to complain about.
It's no wonder that a segment of a population that is more likely than the majority to have more time and money than most have is the layer that spends most money on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plate stores, they do not exclude the existence of a vast number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in plate shops and in online forums.
These people are probably working everywhere in school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday walking around the Bärvik Street plate shops, casting plastics, and avoiding the sights of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake lead who hovers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-year-old men.
The Greenland’s Polar Occlumency — The Longest Cretaceous Animal — A Video Report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record was made by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court rejects the offer to take down shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the authorities of Calais to carry dozens of improvised shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
This week's hearing, the Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to carry a total of 72 improvised shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or just a few euros in improvised restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that these places should be removed because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were essential, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-Government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that improvised shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court held that there was no legitimate ground to expel people running 72 improvised shops, but stated that Calais' prefecture problems were fully understood --
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the baccalales, the cafes, and the restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who were living in very fragile conditions.
He said that the space had provided calm points for a meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the children ' s café of the Book of Jungle in the camp, which does not work for the benefit of offering 200 meals a day, English and French meals and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the children ' s café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not more than eight years old -
Two charitable institutions, assistance to refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the strength of the Jungle camp had grown to over 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in newcomers during the summer.

Britain stops by silver in rugby 7, after Fijian master class allows them to take gold
The impressive British regby 7 series was devastatingly stopped at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were completely crushed by 43-7 at the Deodoro stage here in Rio.
Fiji has provided a master class in ball ownership, disposition, squatting, play support, line rolling, and rough power to win the gold — their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat did not come with too much comfort in the form of silver — Britain’s third in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Olympic tournament on Regby 7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated.
Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier that day, could return to affect them negatively in the final.
But in spite of nothing, Fiji won as much as possible the best team of 15 men.
This may be some comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang on the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s Chief Coach - Ben Ryan, former Chief of England, Wimbledon.
It was a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost just one.
These blows will hurt, but progress is striking.
Fiji started off great for fun, beating back Britain's attempt to intercept the ball.
It was like hitting a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Callisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes per hour, Gerryr Tuway added another tachdaun to the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Great Britain barely got to the ball.
Mitchell's great interception attempt deterred León Nakarav's man-to-man from killing a third man, but that only delayed Fiji.
At seven o'clock, Jas Veremalua made a tacdown in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nacarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more major attempts to intercept Britain and storm the line to get a point.
Implementation took 29-0 a break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play the rugby-7 game, while Great Britain still owns the craft.
Which is to a large extent.
Britain made massive replacements in half of the game, and they blocked Fiji ' s dam for all four minutes, which was good at the first half standard until Joshua Toissov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain, making tachdaun in the left corner to account for 36-7, but the game was long on the way of South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was not possible to admire the full joy of Fiji’s approach.
Mata William decorated Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
There was a whistle, the Fijians were hugging, and Great Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Previously, on the same day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and Britain had slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-final of one attempt each — the difference between the British Implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some wonderful leg work, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Markus Watson, brother 15 to the English team, Anthony, won, and eventually silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the grave fight against cancer.
There won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and that's what it says.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Steining found additional importance to their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two oars missing, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they sought the second consecutive Olympic Gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute; after all, it was their 39th unsuspecting speech, again unprecedented.
What we can see is that two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of the swans do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For each gold, there was a battalion of ready-made hands that contributed to the gradual increase in victory, which was important, and there was no hand that was more important than the hands of the trainer, who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous matter.
I had urinary bubble cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a bad situation.
She's changing your species a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the inter-sessional area, keeping the gap in the schedule minimal, if that could be the correct expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I had to get over it quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and had 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking a few steps.
That's how it starts.
A damselfly is a journey, but it makes her a little more.
The next moment, after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said: \"I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's too much, but it means so much.\"
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much both Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic for three years with Helen and Robyn.
Without Robin, we wouldn't, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in five years.
This pair sets up a heavy rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark teams started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in their reserve.
We were very strong in the phase.
Helen is called, \"Stay in the process, stay in the process.\"
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting to be able to warm up and get out and win the race that we did.
It'll take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at a wedding next month, on her own with Steve Buckshall, a television adventurers.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took me about six months to realize that I had become the Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The Government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The Government had extended the period of destruction of food prohibited for entry into Russia by the end of 2017.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on an official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Since then, the ban has been repeated and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited for Russia to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The recycling of food imported into the country has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of banned products were seized from the sale.

The rains and storms are waiting for us in Moscow on Friday.
The capital region will have an atmospheric front that will cause precipitation and lower air temperature.
The air warms to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] in the afternoon.
For example, on the night of Saturday in Moscow, short-term rain, possible storms and windbreaks will take place up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with storms and windbreaks up to 12-17 m/s.
Storm rains are also projected in Orlovska, Kuronjeg and Voronezha provinces, and reported as “Dni.ru”
Next week, precipitation is unlikely.
A panel of arbitrators of WTO found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when entering WTO.
This is the first time that WTO has decided against the RF - it is mentioned on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators emphasized, in their opinion, that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia ' s measures were systematic - or - comprehensive - -
Russia, in turn, promised to soon adapt imported duties to paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in a report from the Ministry of Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization for Russian action, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US behaviour in resolving contentious issues in WTO undermined the organization's policy of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made a similar statement because the Americans refused to accept Judge Chan Song Hwa of South Korea for a second term.
The Russian Federation would therefore not turn to WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration has been replaced by a Chief
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has renovated the administration of the President and has expressed the hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to be carried out as President of Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, “The news was written that the experts considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of Chief of Administration to be transparent and understandable, and that there would be no fundamental change in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head of the President ' s administration had gone away for a long time and had effectively built up the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Wyno, a man who knew the specifics of his work.
In Poland, it is admitted that Gazprom's fuel will not be purchased.
The State Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that the supply of gas from the RF may become uninvolved after a few years due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish finance company Bogoslav Majez.
He speaks to TASS.
It might happen that we're not going to buy the gas at all (y-Gazproma), and we're going to diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be the East, the raw materials from CNG-terminals and Norway, and Majez.
At present, Gasprom is dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, a 30 per cent increase over 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases has increased to 49.8% compared to 40% earlier.
Recall that on 22 July, the Antimonopoly Authority of Poland did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture, Gazproma, and its European gas pipeline partners - North Stream 2 -
In doing so, Poland had previously left a request for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas to the North Stream 2 -
The Vice-President of the Chalding Board, Alexander Medvedev, made this statement.
The auction on North Stream 2 will take place in 2017 and an auction on its tab is scheduled for autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that `Gazprom' did not yet plan to take any action on the intention of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, the Vice-President of the Board of Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased 42 per cent in gas purchases from the Russian Federation.
Zamprez-Gazproma added that the mere fact that a Polish PGNIG had applied to the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not yet mean that the negotiations would be terminated.
Previously, a Polish company had applied to the court to bring about a reduction in the cost of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gazprom contract for gas supply.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Government of Poland ' s Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, stated that his country could abandon its supply of blue fuels from the east after six years.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new supply terminal for the liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian Shelf.
“North flow-2” provides for the construction of two sea-borne gas pipelines with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first CMM castle in Ukraine.
- I can confirm that the AMM has increased the number of observers in this area - - he said, in response to the question of journalists, he said - RIA News - -
According to OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and the Crimea is calm, and there are no incidents affecting security.
The observers monitored the situation at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The Network had a video of a passenger plane, Jas-42, landing at Ufa airport, who was driving outside the airstrip for 400 metres and falling onto the left wing.
Videos published by TV channel - 360 -
It was 4:30 Moscow time.
The flight from Krasavia came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place that was not affected.
The aircraft itself were being transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport works normally.
The Department of Military Investigation in the transport of the CRS was seeking to ascertain the reasons for the heavy landing of a liner aircraft.
The United Nations investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considers the case to be indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syria negotiations to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
United Nations experts began investigations into allegations of chemical weapons use in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, suspected to be chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in an area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down on the day before, the aircraft had dropped the toxic bombs, but in Moscow those charges had been called a discharge.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakyat Nour al-Din Al-Zinka of having been involved.
It soon became known that there were two toxic bombs.
The BBC was confirmed by one of the victims.
“ Some minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, burning my eyes, breathing hard, I quoted an eyewitness’s word.
As a result, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poisonous gas is confirmed by the experts, the acts will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: “Providence that this has really happened is a lot —
The Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC) sets out the prohibition of chlorine for military purposes.
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlor use by the Syrian army against - moderated opposition -
The situation in Aleppo is compounded by the daily shelling of its areas and by terrorists preventing residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to set up a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of the daily three-hour shut-up in the organization is considered to be insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped -
Staffan de Mistura's adviser for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver assistance and evacuation from the sick and wounded every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from convoys of trucks to areas where the roads are virtually destroyed and the remaining ones are mined,” said Mr. Egeland. “But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the US and Russia concerning the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened \"humanitarian windows\" in Aleppo.
In the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place every day starting Thursday.
The creation of humane windows is intended to ensure the conditions for the transport to the city of medicines, food and basic necessities.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to overthrow the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of bombings on Thai resorts killed four people.
Immediately, a few explosions swept through southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 wounded as a result.
The explosion epicenter was on the town of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four nationals, not Russians.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet been assumed by any of the terrorist groups, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had hastened to state that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police indicate that the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military head of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Phuket beach and Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects of training and organizing the attacks had already been detained, reported Colonel Chrisan Patanacharoen of the police.
While it was too early to talk about goals, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, he was convinced that they were not related to international extremist groups -
Too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they're actually local diversions, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The outbreak took place on the birthday of Queen Sycrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to General Sihichi Srisopacharoenrat, bombs were blown away from a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets, filled with meals at restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The remaining victims are not yet known, but are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German nationals, three Dutch subjects, two Italian nationals and one Austrian national.
There are no Russians among the victims of the bombings.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the 7 August referendum, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be first tested in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall, on 22 May 2014, a military coup under the leadership of the commander of the army of Praiuta Chan-Ocha took place in Thailand.
To that end, he said, the army had led to an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok Came to Be in a State of Emergency
The Thai Government, led by Prime Yinglak Chinavat in January 2014, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There's two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in downtown Bangkok at the victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, resulting in 28 casualties, five of which were in critical condition.
The explosions made unknown motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and recruited military forces to protect demonstrators.
Conditions began to be developed in the Sukh Log.
As has become known, it is understandable that the Government is invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the Suha Log goldfield with two key constraints.
It is proposed that the auction be avoided by companies where 25 per cent or more of foreigners belong and those applicants whose capital would not include a minimum of 25 per cent of public participation.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk for a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August and October.
The Ministry of Nature has introduced to the Government a draft decree and conditions for auction the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Suha Log (Irkutsk Region, Stock and Resources 130 million ounces), and has presented two sources, which are clearly familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday night, one of them being clarified.
In the Ministry of Nature, it was confirmed that the project had been introduced into the Government.
A representative of the curative underuse of Vice-Premier Alexander Bonain said - I mean, the official's project has not yet been made available.
The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and given the deadline for the collection of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held in October, which says to the Ministry of Nature.
According to data -- I guess -- there are two key requirements for the project for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was to be agreed upon by the ministries and FOIVam in July (which is, I guess.
The first is the availability of at least 25 per cent of public participation of applicants in capital.
The second is refusal of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two FZ articles mentioned in the draft, as I think it was earlier, on 2 August, the auction could prevent companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not RF tax residents or have dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Suhay Log is a federally significant subsoil (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Nature, it was confirmed that the project would contain restrictions on the admission of foreign companies - but refused to comment on the details prior to the government's order.
The demand for public participation in the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, spoke in December 2015 -- I think -- in Minsk and later confirmed by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, who had been sent to Minsk by his predecessor, Sergei Erovenko, who had an agreement on investment projects with - Rostek -
Those who lobbied for a restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interviewees did not specify.
“ But this is in the spirit of time: not to take control of Russia’s largest gold deposit against the background of the western sanctions,” the interviewer says, “the most familiar one is with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, stated on August 1 that foreigners could go to a consortium - if the applicants attracted them - as a financial structure, as technological partners -
Interviewers, of course, find it unlikely that conditions will be adjusted in the Government.
Suha Log in industry is regarded as the consortium of the largest gold miner, PAO-Polus, a controlled son of Sulayman Kerim Saidu, and Rosteha-
As I said, I think, in July, the partners set up the Gold SP-SL, where the Polusa had 51 per cent of the share, the Rostecha-RT-GR, 49 per cent.
B - Rostekh - Foreclosed, in Poluse - I think he was interested in this asset - and he had all the necessary competence and resources to develop it.
- But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of conditions - - added to Paul -
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the Russian Federation has been made by sources - I think -
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross were able to participate in the development of the Dry Log, developing assets on Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data, is not interested in the asset.
The head of the gold industry union, Sergei Kashuba, estimated in December 2015 -- initially -- investment in the Dry Log at $2.5 to 4 billion.
Most potential applicants are driving off not only the volume of investment, but also the complexity of the project: serious stock and complex ore technology needs to be explored, explained by industry interlocutors, which is very straightforward.
The pension market launched the largest M&A-KIT Finance Pension Administrator, which launched the consolidation process of four controlled NPFs.
As a result, a total of approximately 373 billion rubs will be created under the “Gazfund Pension Savings”.
Starting the procedure for the pooling of four pension funds - - KIT Finance - - - PROMOGROON - - Heritage - - and - Gasfund Pensions - - yesterday reported to the owner of 100 per cent of the GS-KIT Funds Finance to the Pension Administrator -
“The reorganization is in agreement with the CBS, subject to the requirement of non-destruction of the terms of the contracts in force” is stated in the company's communication.
The association is based on - Gasfund Pensions -
According to the gender director of the NPF, Oleg Bjelošicki, the consolidation of the funds has several objectives: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, citing the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF-Gazfund, Pension Savings will be the largest player in the UPU market.
As at 31 March, pension savings for the pooled funds amounted to over 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the funds' web site, the beneficiaries of their owner - CIT Finance Pension Administrator - are now Anatolia Gavrilenco (with 65 per cent of GS-controlled) and NPF-Gazfund (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
For example, the group O1 of the NPF - The Future - absorbed - Stallfund - as early as the beginning of this year.
This combined NPF now joins the funds - Uralsib - and the Russian Standard -
The integration into a single structure, in addition to cost reductions, is necessary for structural tasks - notes the Director-General of NPF - The Future - Nikolai Sidorov.
Active fund consolidation has been under way since April in the Safmar - NPF - European - Education and Science - and the Regional Fund should be integrated into NPF - Safmar by the end of the year.
In 2017, they will be joined by NPF - Trust -
The merger of funds would have the effect of enhancing control over risks, operations and expenditures - noted in the pension group - Safmar -
A pause in the pooling of funds held by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator may be caused by several reasons, according to experts.
Until recently, NFPs had not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the output of the infrastructure bonds into which the team was actively located.
After the amendment of the EC Regulation in March this year on a number of issuers conforming to the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can buy out one big player - the director of the ACAD financial rating group, Yury Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 on assets also call the separation of spheres of influence another possible cause of the pause, and consequently the appointments in the single fund, which were to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenco was not available for comment.
I mean, I guess, NPF Gazfund didn't answer either.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and costly exercise, at a long distance, this decision will be justified.
According to the CEO of the consulting company -Pension partner - Sergei Okolesnov, Gazfunda Pensions are less outflows, and accession will stabilize the base of the other funds in the group.
The best practices of NPF-KIT Finance-and-Promagrofund will be sought in the construction of retail sales of SPS, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The demand for NPF processes and personnel is growing steadily, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four foundations with a single investment policy, the Managing Director of Corporate Ratings, Expert RA - Pavel Mithrovanov.
The effect of reducing duplicate functions will clearly overlap the possible costs of merging - notes Mr. Mithrovanov.
The cost of merging four Sergei Okolenov funds is estimated at rouble 30-50 million.
The cost of these four funds is approximately £400 million per year, with real halves in the medium term - sure Mr. Okolenov.
The Russian procrastinator had the best Disney movie - Pete and his dragon -
New Zealand's beautiful species, a merciful dragon, a souly story, and a song in the style of country enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, believes ELENA CROATCUN.
The frightened child was picked up by a dragon, who became a human babysitter and a gentle babysitter, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliott, after having a pup from the storybook, plays with him and falls asleep in the picture.
Six years later, he was abandoned and trapped, no longer distinguished from another conceited wild beast, Maugly.
In this way Pete finds a red-haired female Ager Grace (Brace Dallas Howard), while Gavin's Brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively jacking the forest.
Now she'll have to believe not only that there's a dragon, but also to help save him.
Pete takes an accelerated course of being human — surrounded by the American idyllic shirts, the moral code in his heart, and smiles blinder than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too horribly so that the viewer really starts to hate him or fear him.
Even Gavin, who had opened his hunting hunt for the unusual forest inhabitant, is far from an incorrigible thief.
The huge fluffy dragon also proved to be not scary, with a good bulldog face, an airliner’s wing swing, and the ability to become invisible.
It's a fun thing to lose, it's antler, it's even crunchy, and fortunately it doesn't say, but it's always wanted to be smoothed, and it's very different from all the known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding onto such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most stressful of times, they start to scold desperately in three arms, not only the small spectators, but also the adults.
Oaks Figley is an amazingly good and young person as Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually issues a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did Director David Lowry manage to remove the fantastically cute remack of a forgotten Disney film, Dracon Pitt, in 1977, mediated from the nose to the tip of his tail, remembered only by the mix of animation and playing movies, and make him the most hearty movie this summer?
Not unless the miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry, of the original, actually took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There's music rooms and most of the weird jokes out there.
This good story reads the drawings taken from Bambi-Inoplanetian and many other sweet hearts of children.
The Disney Study continues to expand the gallery of high-quality twenty-first century belts.
Of course, \"Peth and dragon\" are not as beautiful as the same \"The Jungle Book\" and there's no artificial villain that Kate Blanchet was as a stepmother in the new \"Zolzuk\"
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and good in the best of Disney’s traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, the director of Lowry, will be given another -- for the art film-adaptation story of Peter Pane --
A labourer at Pete and his dragon, tandem David Lowry, and screenwriter Toby Hallbrux entered a new ambitious project about not a grown-up boy on James Barry's same-named story.
A new charge will be brought to RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov
The lawyers of the RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found insufficient evidence in the case of their defence counsel.
That the Prosecutor's Office made such a presentation, we found out from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of the restriction of access to criminal files, but the session was not held, and the investigators told us about the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office - it brings back to RBC the words of counsel Olga Dinze.
She stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were inadequate.
Investigators will now have to remove the evidentiary gaps and bring new charges to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CCC) would appear, or the same but with other arguments and new evidence would be clarified by Mrs. Dinze.
As reported, Aleksandr Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the wording of the political situation towards instability of the RBC journalist, and of the breakdown of the authority by illegal means -
Correspondent-Commersantboscosport- ALEXANDR ZILBERT has lived an Olympic in the Olympic Village, inspected the house with a Russian assembly, eaten in a local dining room, and even passed a WADA test thereafter.
I don't think life's dying here for a second.
Even at night.
The latest starts sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
Furthermore, resettlement and evictions from the village are being carried out without interruption, as some athletes complete their interventions and leave Brazil and, on the contrary, only arrive here.
By 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations were stretching into one of the provisional tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, the leader of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov.
It's hot water trouble, so, sorry, toilets.
We fought for a long time for cleanness.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the wedgers came, but they only stick some stuff on the floor, and that's all.
They've got the floors, see if they're innovative.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know the laminate, the common laminate!
Anyway, we've made a change to the Klingon company and now we're all OK with it.
The Olympic village is a Southern Butovo, sleeping area fenced on the one side of the mountains, with a pristine roar, filled with muddy water.
There's still a two-foot-long railway fence around which the automatics run for safety.
A total of 17,000 persons may be housed in the village in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
On one of the 18th stage buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is entirely in need of our assembly.
Looking at the little foyer at the entrance, it is possible to immediately determine what problems seem to be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the registration stand: print - please don't put the paper in the toilet - and hand - I'll take the gift of the badge.
The rack's drowning in the tracts itself.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the headlines of the booklets: “Memorial on infectious diseases for travellers in Rio de Janeiro” - First aid in drowning, foreign body falls into the respiratory tracts, conscious loss - stages of cardiac and lung resuscitation - - First aid in burns, heat shock, fractures and hemorrhages -
The text inside is actually encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, the good outcome is not all.
Of course, there is a health centre in the assembly area of Russia, which is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massages, to the inhabitants of the home.
On the contrary, it's the headquarters of my delegation.
Near the door is an inspiring poster. - No matter what, we'll win.
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are absolutely crazy!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia won't back down, it won't break!
And to further the elevating of the spirit, the announcement goes forth: “Dear brothers and sisters!
Following the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russ Kirilla, the protoirs, Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeiev, are carrying out spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympic Congregation Russia.
The ordering of the baby and the other requirements can be done by telephone...
There is, in general, a Centre for meditation and religious observances for all faiths within the village.
And the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position, that they have their own living room.
With the elevator loaded from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, there was a question of the bodies lying on it.
It seems they were the sleeping staff of the new Klingon company.
I guess they'd be willing at any time to wash the innovative genders, and they decided to set up a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expected to meet a longtime acquaintance, Vitali Fedorović Dubco, coach of our Battuists, who led them to Olympic gold some 16 years ago in Sydney.
He kindly agreed to show his rooms to the European champion Jan Pavlov.
There's nothing to be done about it, but it's not critical.
One's for the four, but it's clear.
The glass, of course, is funny, it's not trust, but you can put things in.
- No, you pretend, the tea's over. - It's a sprained-up tennis player, Svetlan Kuznetsov, who's met me in the main dining room.
At least because it represents an area of 2,000 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 trips per day to the mountain, and they are free of charge.
The menu options are as follows: \"The best of Brazil \" - World cuisines - - Asian dishes - and - Drink, macaroni products -
The last option, I thought, is that it's very popular with our volleyballs.
But let's say I didn't find soups in any of the giant restaurant units.
What soup?
I'm glad I took Chinese with me, welded.
And a teapot.
But in general, to make you realize, we've got worse food on the courts.
There's something you can choose from here, despite the intolerable uniformity.
I personally chose cod for steam and fries in tomato sauce.
A three-language, English, French and Portuguese tablet is held in close proximity to each dish, as well as indicating the food value of the produce and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, I'm sure it's eaten.
I don't even understand why this is always a local McDonald's turn.
A lively, relaxed, warm - up athlete outside the restaurant waits for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're lured by a catchy Victorine, the winner of which is given a T-shirt.
Invoking, you can say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There's a question on the Russian!
But it wasn't.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic outburst, naturally.
The situation has already become worse on the second question: “If I have received a notification of my doping control, should I go to the doping control point immediately”
I stopped at option B: \"No, I have one hour.\"
I lost, so to say, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA is not supposed to wait.
Anyway, we have to be right now.
And in stage seven, my situation became totally critical of me.
I thought, for some reason, that if it would be difficult for me to maintain a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and it's hard for me to do so!), then I could use bio-additions to get additional nutrients to increase my productivity --
No, you don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated so that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, several sentences are denied.
It's not fair playing WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There is nowhere to go behind Ethymov, Isinbayev, and all our unblemished crew.
That's why I've concentrated and won the unfortunate T-shirt out of my later efforts.
Know ours, as it is said!
In a winning mood, I've lost my Phytness Center in the neighborhood.
Get the coach count.
He crashed at 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete was found in this accumulation of running roads.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let's train someone who can't play!
There's one of our guys sitting in the clinic next to him.
Queued for the round.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, however, a condom - producing machine is hung around the village.
It is inspired by an encouraging call: \"Hold with the horse,
The iron that resembles a doorlock handle and a condom made from the Amazon's natural latex are then left to move out of the machine.
I took myself for memory.
The athletes won't wake up, and they've got 450,000.
There is an entire entertainment centre in the Olympic Village for the celebration and celebration.
There is a training table next to it, which reminds the International Olympic Committee to spend $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is full of video games, billards and tennis tables, desktop football and hockey, and some kind of weird video-trainer-like devices.
- I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian assembler who actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, you could just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of an assembly in Russia, and that's all.
Here, by the way, there's some strange leak in the eyes of guys in yellow and blue.
The player's the team, he's the one.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village.
But if you walk and not drive, you will also have a Canadian collection house with a salmon at the entrance and a tent with a recovery bath and a ticket office, a laundry and cleaning shop, a hairdresser and a flower shop, and a store with items from everyday consumption, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't keep track of Chinese philatelics), and a bank, and a collection office, and a photo-ciosque.
And late in the evening, you will sit by the olive tree, hanged with the flowers of various colors, to remember the world's friends and relatives who have left the world.
And you're going to be under the billboard of a machine that's indiscriminately spraying liquid to kill insects, to think about forever.
That's about Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was inhaling, watching Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, real painkillers went into the net.
Few know: the news that Inna Deriglozas won the gold in the XXXI Olympics rapier, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who saw this happen -- not counting those, of course, who watched the Carioca competition that night.
It can only be understood by the real painkiller.
Imagine, a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors from below -- as always by nighttime -- are waking up and starting to be unscathed, but shouting out loudly at each other.
It's threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market in the kitchen and buy, as the plumber asked, new.
The TV schedule is not clear, so it's just holding on to control the channels, Match, First, and just in case - Russia - although it's almost pointless.
♪ Russia ♪ a family of repetitions ♪ the whole sport in there is somewhere on the record ♪
There's live live TV shows.
Hope, of course, on \"Match\" -- a whole evening a young man screamed in news production first about the big semi-final of Deriglias-Shanayava, then about the next fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball is US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong, by the way.
The Australians were on an equal footing, and the first half won.
They put the American people in their shoes because of their own greatness.
As a result, the loser has failed, but the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight with Dee French, and there's no change in the screen.
In easy panic, I start writing channels.
That's the feeling, it's the second time.
All right, let's go deep into the cable.
There's no fencing on any of the subject-matters.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to start.
Text and tweeting of some sports sites is not good for me.
Road surfing produces unexpected but brilliant results.
First, it turns out, there's direct technical broadcast of all the competitions going on at that point in time.
Calling fencing, getting friends for gold.
Deriglaze is very counter-attacked, it's moving forward, and it's obviously starting to pull in.
The Italian woman's playing almost all of the break.
Our one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
De Francesca throws himself at Dereaglesca, but she retreats, she ends up, she's got an injection.
Win!
A few seconds later, an Olympic messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
It's coming out, I'm the first person to see it with his eyes.
The crazy, the loyal, the involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (DOM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DOM plenum obliged its imams to preach Fridays only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to learn their mother tongue.
The authorities claim that this, and in some cases, does not infringe, the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani finds that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of those who are foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their preaching in Tatar would not reach all the audience
Yesterday, the DOM plenary of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar language only.
According to the Mufty of Tatarstan Camille Samigulin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to learn their mother tongue -
- For those who say it's hard - in every great mosque, we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language completely free of charge. - Mr. Samigulin promised.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force — and today all mosques of preaching must be in the Tatar language,
He recalled that the Tatar - language DOM of Tatarstan was publishing the magazine Shura.
Imam, who doesn't speak too well in Tatars, may be well prepared for --
The DOM of Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand arrivals in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muftia, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Russian was used mainly in Kazani in a number of mosques.
In particular, as Muftyy indicated, this was practiced at the Burnayev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniller -
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership was working to ensure that all students possessed the two national languages of the Republic, regardless of their nationality.
“No way of speaking of the indignity of the Netator Muslims” stressed Mr. Muhammetshin, explained that the preaching itself was not a compulsory, the main part of the namaz.
In doing so, the namas themselves will continue to read Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said, I guess, that there was no significant threat of getting Tatar from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, it is not known that sermons are used in the Republic.
The decision of the DOM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCO).
The head of the WKT community, Rinate Zakirov, said, \"I don't know what's going on, but it's a major part of our national life.\"
It would be sad if Tatar was removed from this area.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language - the wishes of the imams themselves - but in the WCT community - is considered to be the right thing to do -
The respondents, of course, are the imams who preach in Russia, ready to follow up on the DOMS, but they believe that they will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
Of course they're going to be tired.
- She's gonna have to get over it.
He said that even many Tatars are closer to the Russian language, since Russian is at school and in kindergartens and in radio and everywhere —
He believes, however, that the mosque will be able to continue the Russian language lessons and lectures held at other times.
We rely on Allah.
God will bring an end to this situation, and he has concluded it.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
They're Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
Foreign students — Africans, Arabs — have come to us a lot.
- That's why we've been in Russian for four years.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will reach a shorter circle and will not reach the entire audience.
But we will obey the plenary’s decision.
Just the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
- For example, I'm only going to get easier, because Tatar is my native language. - I made Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former Director, FXIN, was put before the court
The Moscow Public Prosecutor's Office has approved the indictment of the criminal case under investigation by the SSRC on the theft of the budget allocated to the FSIN of Russia.
The trial will be preceded by Alexander Reimer, head of the prison department, and his deputy, which caused more than 2.7 billion rubles to FSIN.
The Capital Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to Zamoskvorec Garden against the former Director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, and his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the FHPP - Information Technology and Communications Centre of the Federal Punishment Service - (CITEF) Victor Excise.
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in the commission of the offence, they are charged with the CDU in Moscow at para. 3 of article 285 of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority with grave consequences), at para. 4 of article 159 of the Criminal Code (fraud by virtue of their official position in an organized group, particularly large).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged with article 222 of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CSR, in 2010-2012, the individuals in question fraudulently seized from the public treasury the budget allocated to FCNIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budgetary money, the group developed a scheme according to which its CITES-controlled business, with which it entered into relevant government contracts, produced technical means of control and supervision, including electric bracelets, and carried out at prices over several times.
Despite the lack of production equipment, CITESF buildings, production facilities to establish a completed cycle of electric bracelets between it and the Russian FSIN, five government contracts were concluded with a value of over 3.3 billion roubles.
This scheme has resulted in more than 2 billion roubles in the accounts of the Samar branch of FIGD, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a consequence, Mr. Reimer, in his office, received more than £140 million in cash cash from an accomplice, whose criminal proceedings were assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machinations, found an unknown origin of the ammunition in the award gun, allowing him to face an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FCIN claimed $2.7 billion of damages for the accused.
Hakura, a footballist, is suspected of being involved in putch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of Parliament, Hakana Shukura, searched his family ' s two houses.
The 1990s - early 2000s Turkish football star Hakan Shukur is being searched by the country's authorities for an attempt at a coup d'état last month.
Ford, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an armed terrorist group -
It is the movement of Kismit, a society connected with a prominent Turkish religious figure and opposition from Fethullah Gullen.
It is President Erdogan who views it as the organizer of the attempted military coup that took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Güllen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, Hakan Shukura ' s arrest warrant was issued today, and police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of the former football player.
According to the investigation, the organization of Fethullah Gülen, in addition to Hakan Shukür himself, included his father.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones found themselves there.
He and his family are now living in the United States.
In his domestic life, football player Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated a congregational country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarae
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian-Torino-Inter and Palermo and English-Blackburn
True, he didn't spend more than a season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur still remains Turkey's most successful attack, with 112 national team matches and 51 ball-killed matches in his assets.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned from his position as a deputy due to an earlier corruption investigation around the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and links with an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Güllen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, the media can wait for long prison terms, from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Conchalowski wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
- I would have set up a network of cinemas only for the Russian cinema, which cost two or three times as much tickets as for foreign films - - he said.
Mr. Conchlovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for spectators with large Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 images a year, of which an average of 20 to 25 tapes arrive before screens.
“ And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers — and the Iron Man — in the promotion of whom huge budgets have been rolled in,” said the filmmaker.
Recall that on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum (Tavrida) began its work in Crimea.
Participants include creative teachers and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian backgrounds from all over Russia and a number of countries from nearby and distant overseas.

I mean, I mean, the new gene is going to give up Zenit Arena by 26 December.
The new gene contractor for the St. Petersburg stadium, who is to host the 2017 Confederation Cup and the 2018 World Cup, Metrostros, promises to rent by 26 December, reports RIA News with reference to the head of the Interim Commission of the Federation Council for the Preparation for the 2018 Tulpanova World Cup.
“ Today, with Russia’s Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko visited the building, and we had a gender director, Metrostroya, Wadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd give up the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Peterburg company, and it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I were pleased with what we saw and heard, and quoted from the interviewer's agency.
In the past, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the venue for upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that his Soufeda commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the construction on a regular basis.
It was recalled yesterday that Metrostruct to complete construction - Zenit Arena - the contract cost would be about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won bids to upgrade the area around the stadium, contract costs 2.4 billion roubles. Contracts with AO Corporation-Transstro - - AO-Injiniringo Corporation-Transstro-SPb - and AO-Injiningo Corporation-Transstro - were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miassa, Chelabina, the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstan Akulich was detained.
According to the International and Southern Ural, another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Constantine Akulić was now summoned to the Miassa J.S.R. to charge for a one-year limitation of the beatings.
Constantine Akulić then went to the accident site as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
Now that he started to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be Akulić, which is Sergei Kolosowski.
Constantine Akulić became a lawyer for the ex-Deputy Governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the appeal by the Miassa attorney, the defence party informed him that the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov was accused was due to expire on Monday.
Recall that there are two criminal cases against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first fraud case, he is informed of the 1.5 million rouble promise to assist in the appointment of Mayor Magnitogorsk as Chief of Administration, Lake Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of COP-Pyton-Igor Kalugin in the form of an illegal donation of property services of at least 1.3 million rubies.
For more details on Mr. Sandakov's case, read in the material -- I mean, the former vice-governor needs to bring his affairs together --
The Russian Honey Company (RMC) is ready to assume social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed by, for example, the fact that the ROM has embarked on the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally friendly enterprises in the country, the Carabas Medical Room.
The Carabas Medical Plant was founded by an English shareholder led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise that was relevant to the country ' s economy and effectively ensured the life of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, production was stopped owing to financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the operation of the Carabas Medical Room.
There was also a need to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant, the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notoriously known as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the business became run by the Russian Honey Company.
The company has begun to modernize production, gradually reducing environmental pressures.
This was noted recently by the Governor of the Chelabin region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited first numbers in July, Karabashmed.
The head of South Ural described the dramatic changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RMC group.
The main modernization event of the Carabascéme has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid system to capture up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Honey Company, Al-Vaud Levine, the investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the modernization of Zao-Karabashme is the reconstruction of the converter shift.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, and a gas flow tract is scheduled to take place at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion rouble clean-up facility is planned to be launched at the end of 2016.
In turn, taxes for the city of Karabash are also rising.
During the course of the Tomin GOC project, from the beginning of construction until phase two, the federal treasury will receive £8.9 billion.
And with the introduction of GOC, the tax flow to all levels may amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varné district, the budget at various levels listed 346.3 million roubles.
And that's the first year.
“The longer the enterprise succeeds, the more the payments may be, the more Valerie Ulanowski added.
In the MCC, it was stated that in 2015 tax returns from the Micaic GOK approached 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation and development of the RMAs in their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC companies help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and to build territories.
In 2016, one of the biggest social projects of the Russian Honey Company in Karabash was the major renovation, and, in fact, the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten into 95 inmates.
The building, built in 1960, was in emergency condition.
A landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and overland parking spaces for 600 machinery, cafes, and sports shops will also be located in Arena's area.
The Arena Framework will allow for excellent international sports activities to take place.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sport affordable for the people of Chelabinsk, especially the children.

The Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that adolescents were involved in prostitution.
This is reported on Thursday, 11 August by The Local.
He said that some youths told the agency that someone in Copenhagen was organizing prostitution -
According to the publication, doubts of the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan described similar stories in Malmö.
In 2015, the crisis in the European Union was followed by the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them in its territory.

A man found a raccoon among others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to a local oceanrium.
Lobster weighs about a kilogram.
Wayne Nieckerson (Wayne Nickerson) has been fishing for browsters for the last 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in her career, the man was caught with a blue lobster in 1990.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the break-up of democratic servers.
United States officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the breaking up of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is reportedly required to formally accuse Russia of an attack on a server or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States security forces are almost certain of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name the attackers.
An exception is made in 2014 by the breaking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, with the publication being written.
Even if officials found that hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They need to determine whether the incident is so serious that it exacerbates tensions in bilateral relations.
Previously, it was reported that Barak Obama ' s administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against a State which had been hacked by the Nazi-committee servers of the Democratic Party.
The WikiLeaks website has published an electronic correspondence to the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In Kremlin, such reports were considered absurd.

As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reporting to FAS manager Alexey Dazco.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends first to examine the decision and will only then determine with further action whether to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service had found the company to be in violation of the competition law in September last year and had ordered that the contracts be adjusted until 18 December.
On Google, however, they did not agree.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of a world agreement.
That will not lead to anything.
This is what the leading analyst, Mobile Research Group Eldar Murtazin, said, \"Ehu Moscow.\"
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Effect-Anime-Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon on Asians.
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by animum, but some commentators say it's raceless.
With the tool-Linsa-Snapchat, it allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that are face to face absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to fit the picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lins are crude, twisting tools that produce over 30 million adjusted selves a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming known.
Linses Snapchat were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of a person or of encouraging white-headed persons to be the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them an eyelash, bloody teeth, and fluffy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon against Asians — yellow-eyed —
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to a more serious diversity-related problem for the company.
There were reports on Wednesday and a follow-up to the misreporting on The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat claimed that he had removed this function.
The company commented: the lens was designed to respect characters with anim, not as a cartoon on Asians.
But experts who know of racism are not insolent were reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the comparison with animum.
In an e-mail, Grace Spapani, a Korean-American student of the arts whose photo tweets were actively shared, said that the lens was -- offensive and at least awkward --
She added that it was hard to argue side by side with very rough cartoons on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowing but highly destructive of yellowing.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deviouss we all carry with us.
And the great audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- may mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, on Thursday 25-year-old Katie Zhu said, \"It's much more difficult to stay unheard of as it was before.\"
On Thursday, Joe, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of Sneptchat.
Zhu criticized mostly the white leadership of the male-only company and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Jo, who is himself an American of Chinese origin: “They did not have enough non-white people in their state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not hold positions where they can speak safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her view, complaining that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and actively try to involve domestic resources.
For his part, Jo said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: \"I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them that it doesn't work\"
Military leadership has distorted IGIL intelligence, reports the congressional commission
The US Central Command of the Armed Forces modified the intelligence records to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, rather than justifying the events on the ground, reported to the congressional commission on Thursday.
An interim report of the operational group set up by the Republican Presidents of the Committee of the Chamber of Representatives for the cases of the BC, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found a wide-ranging disillusionment among researchers of the Central Command Intelligence Service who claimed that the leaders had sent their assessments of American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The Central Command known as the Centkom is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command tended to provide a more optimistic picture of the U.S. anti-terrorism activities than confirmed by real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies — as stated in the news release dedicated to the report.
What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when top leadership seems to be inaccurate, our military is suffering — a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, said.
Management problems in Centkom are reaching the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the ongoing deficiencies in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the armed forces of Iraq provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain final evidence that Obama’s management ordered the falsification of reports, it argues that analysts felt that Centcoma’s leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the Islamic State’s threat, also known as IGI or ISIL.
During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were far more optimistic than actual events — reported on.
For example, Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at Mosul ' s return could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“ After months of investigation, this is certainly known ” said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a national from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence management of the U.S. Central Command foresaw intelligence documents of command in order to mitigate the threat posed by IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the data published on Thursday will be more advanced.
The Centralham Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence conducts an additional, not completed investigation of intelligence at the moment.
The representatives of the Democratic Party to the Intelligence Committee of the United States Congress House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which was consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“The Centre has established an excessively closed procedure for producing intelligence assessments for IGIL and Iraqi security forces in 2014 and 2015” states a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the principal representative of the democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, has delayed the issuance of intelligence documents - has harmed the morale of analysts and - lacks sufficient reflection of dissimilar views -
But Schiff and Democrats argue that they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom's analysts to force their conclusions into a given or political interpretation --
Preliminary results of the congressional inquiry were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Coast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, which followed the complaints of the Analysts of Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while an investigation by the Chief Inspector was continuing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims more and more representatives).
But last year's statements call into question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide valid assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The criticism of intelligence across the Islamic State repeats the disputes that occurred more than a decade ago when the intelligence analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George Walker Bush had protested many analysts in support of a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what would follow the invasion of 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest of intelligence within the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements of the reverse, the aircraft on oil racing plants owned by the Islamic State had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil racing plants to sell oil in the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in the Times in September.
The then commander, Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after witnessing in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in a women's hockey game on the grass, thus approaching a decisive takeover with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended with the victory over Japan with an account of 6-1, Katie Beam opened the bill on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. Women's Hockey team on grass, when the Americans won the 3-0 score over India's team.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she'd ever do something like that.
- I won't bet, she said.
I'm not really one of those people who's tracking their heads.
That's what she knows: America's 4-0 score in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's losing score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday last round.
Both teams claim a quarter of the final, and the outcome of the game will determine who takes first place in their six-command team and who takes the second.
The winner will run out of the competition with a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little weathered when the quarter-finel starts playing.
But Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made the noise of their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London's games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a hook-up on grass when she was 3 (her senior twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national gathering at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the Olympics 2008, when she did not take the finals.
Then came 2012 when everyone got sick of her and her teammates.
The following year, Koig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and it was all beginning to change.
“ Cultural change, psychological change, changes in physical training, ” said Bem.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity that we now have.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bem opened the account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand over the short distance.
India had come to play without a single tournament victory, but the team had shown itself to be remarkably tough and had maintained the 1-0 score until the third period when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long walk with the ball down on the left side of the field, then leaned into the middle and threw the ball sharply into the gate, giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added a goal in the middle of the fourth period.
Breathing was the first U.S. goal for Jackie Briggs to pass one goal at each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So does Bam.
- We're in a good position right now - - says Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Through the non-use of the Olympic Games, the “dun” of the Battuta leaps
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem constant and inevitable, a terrible combination of competition and aspirations.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's that hot torch that's passed from the archer to the piper, to the gymnasium, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talk in turn at the cafe, not to hear about Simon Bails, Katie Ledeki, or the fighting between Michael Felps and Chad de Klo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first to participate in the Olympic Games, is a beautiful man with claws on his cheeks, and could well have been among the celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-sellers if he had been a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fencie.
But a 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic Batut jump contests.
The Olympic light does not cover all events in the same way.
Far from the centre, in part in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun firing, bow shooting, badminton, taquondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak out in favor of my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the humble charm of the jumpers on the bat.
Although Battuta jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted in Sydney games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware of the fact that they generally refer to Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States had been sending athletes to competitions, they had never won medals at the Battut jumps, and their athletes had not come to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male rewards and Chinese and Canadian awards.
Dun Dun Dunn of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But booty jumps have an outsider ball, especially because for an uninvited ear, they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, but a land-based enthusiast.
They truly have the comic potential — the caricature of unending leaps — but also the embellishment of gymnastics and jumps in water, the two sports they usually combine.
The word - baut - is from the Spanish word - el trampolín - meaning - trampline for leaps in the water -
The winners jump on a giant Battuta, take off for nearly 30 feet, and have to perform a series of acrobat tricks (turns, bends and saltos) before finally landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and time of flight according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
The candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes finish, and sometimes back and forth, all over the field.
They seek not only a final drawing or a starting wall, but also, in the face of a television camera, to a different tipping edge: the world's or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, awe - inspiring, even fanatic, and it is enough to make even the viewer slip away.
But I think it's a little tiring when you watch the game.
He's got jumps on his boot giving you a break.
Batutista's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And, of course, they're not going to be without competition or difficulties, but there's no senseless french in the whole programme, no leaps in length, only a strange, egregious extinction of time and gravity.
It's the closest sport to the day.
Women's qualifications and then the finale will be Friday afternoon, broadcasting on the day of Eastern European time; male on Saturday, also on an hour.
NBC will broadcast the final part of the day's programme from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic plague, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the common dump.
And if consciousness can only be gained by giving male athletes a masterful view and objectivity — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested to female athletes in the United States — Dooley is waiting for his new, uproaring crowd of fans.
- Generation protests - in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
violent protests in Ethiopia
The demons, who demand political change in Ethiopia, have faced bitter opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of rifting?
Over the past decade, she has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading over an increasing number of its territories.
In just the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
Witnesses alleged that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Videos from protests allegedly taken late last or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put them on a wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it would be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive speed.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
Her streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations have consistently referred to governmental repression, opposition within the State, at the expense of the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were sent, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But that might change.
“ If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, the uprising will rise,” said Sayum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the takeover of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies have completely outlawed the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; fighting over this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use unrest and rearmament.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, a few years of deep - down boiling, are now emerging.
The first seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized to protest.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, mainly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business in Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
- We'll act together under a single beginning,' said Mulata Gemech, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
A third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, down to his death from unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have anticipated danger.
Analysts claim that he identified the first signs of discontent in a particularly deceptive way and used scouts to obtain data and remove opposers.
“ The current regime lacks common sense, ” said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalin, appeared nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of Tiger-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands protested that the analysts had said it was likely the elections that the Government had set in motion and then falsified the results.
During the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, although in smaller numbers than in recent months, a period of unrest was relatively fast.
Development experts commended Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure, such as a new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously, this did not stop the increase of internal frustration by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondara, Amhar city, attacked companies belonging to the Tigris and anti-Tygris hatred in social networks is becoming comprehensive.
Analysts say that the protestors put the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, the West clearly wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his ally to lose power in a already unstable region.
- And it's gonna be hard to get through to this tight rope. - 'Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, by Sarcasm.
Donald J. Trump attempted to replace the last conflict covering his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he stated several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of a terrorist group of the Islamic State.
Clarification raised new questions as to the ability of the candidate for the presidency of the Republican party to turn wisely to the American people.
It also put his alternates, who were trying to protect him during a period of unrest, in a awkward situation because they had to explain what he probably did not mean.
In expressing this assumption at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded IGI.
But on Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just driving.
This post was a direct contrast to the statement made just the day before when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When the conservative radio director Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to soften his speech, he was reminded that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, a candidate for the presidency of the Republican party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against the background of a decline in ranking.
Trump and Clinton have spoken with competing things about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to revert to the subject.
Again, when he used Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said he felt her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as a justification.
In late July, after he drew general criticism, virtually expressing the idea that Russians should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying: “Of course, I'm kidding.
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and pick up his words if necessary.
- I think it's his way of testing any kind of message that has a response among his worshipers, to watch how they act, and then to explain it in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,' said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who was conducting a language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Rather than soften words for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more explicit tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is taking off Clinton with a big shift in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and is going to be level in Florida.
Although Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpretation of his words and lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
But since Trump was the target of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have made his loyal allies uncomfortable: they have to support him publicly, however provocative his words may be.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former mayor of New York, one of the most famous Deputy Trumps, made serious efforts to protect the interview candidate, CNN, on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment,” said Juliani when asked the question of the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it an undiminished threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it all happened because he led troops out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that Obama’s administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, allowed IGIL to develop as it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania meeting on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for urination and prejudice of every word he said.
He made fun of the poor -- the TV experts who were trying to figure it out -- and said, \"We're weak.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's justifications, more than a confirmation that he was not eligible for presidents.
Once pushed, the caffeine goes back to Greenpoint.
Caffeine Verb was a shellhouse, taking only a cash seat in Williamsberg, which had no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was expelled from her Bedford Avenue.
Magasin Soup Sherry, who took the place Verb in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake soap.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a new city.
Artist Molly Crabple wrote in Twitter: \"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and \"Verb\" is now a soap shop.\"
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is being updated.
The reborn caffeine, Verb, opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of the original site.
There are Wi-Fis and credit cards in the new Verbe, but there's some of the same staff and a kind of simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The head of the new Verba stands for Sisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of old coffee, who is the owner and general manager in the new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to contribute to it in a new location, he said he would be happy to do that.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left much to be seen.
Werb works with the same beig distributor and bought the same model of caffeine.
It even has the old Verba mirrors.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu contains bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and has capping capers or roasted onions.
There's a brown rice dish.
The coffee is no longer served, but fresh, fresh juices are being prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
- Many former clients also paid for Williamsberg's prices, he shared.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Oliveira, 34 years old, had lived in Williamsberg and had frequent visits to Verb
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
- I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that imbued me at Verbe, and she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day, instead of a regular ice coffee, she ordered a bought tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, had faithfully visited Verb, starting in 2003.
He went in front of the job and ordered that the same work be kept constant.
“ At the fifteenth minute of the eighth, every day, as in time, I came, and for me my bagel was prepared with butter and all the utensils,” he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a routine order, but he's ever changing something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bag with all the chopsticks.
Rodriguez said he wasn't hurt that the soap shop had once taken over an old place.
Moreover, the owners, Soup Sherry, suggested making a special soap for Verba, using a coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
- I think we might agree to their proposal, '\" said Rodriguez.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodríguez said that he was planning to find a place for him in a vitrina so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
There are other benefits to the new location.
The local place for the sale of juices is planning to spill the bottles and sell the coffee in a cold way.
There is a likelihood that the coffee plant will join the neighboring building.
For many clients, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he said he was killed in grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new location, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he were back home.
- How long ago I wanted to feel the scent - he confessed.
Depressive food for depression in the Plot Trap
In March 1933, shortly after he came to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a Gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of Fifth Avenue, such as Fua-gra and Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato mash, and cheese pudding.
- It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,' said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cowe added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat —
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
The last book, Couah, “The Republic of China, was devoted to the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book — House 97 on Fruit Garden Street —
Their new collaborative work, the Plot Trap, to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a story of an American meal in the Great Depression.
In some way they had their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple snack in the Flateiron Quarter, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the Birgee Crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a plum cheese and a sandwich with slices of olives, while Kow, 57, took a turkey, potato mash, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion of food in the age of Depression.
“ Roulettes have taken advantage of a lot of demand, ” said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, a beans roll.
They were made from a major ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to melt.
Imagine eating as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Coo's swung.
\"Perhaps he was lying in the stomach with a rock,\" he said.
In the years leading up to the Depression, the United States table, particularly in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups prepared a farm for male workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I.
“ It was a time when the food became a central, challenging subject for the Americans, ” said Cow, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and cakes, became the main food; the roast was an excellent way to make the utensils work — it noticed Zigelman, because the cooks could hide the unappetitive ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruits.
The meat, which has been the foundation of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value are more important than taste and even culinary sense.
By doing research on a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“ This addition to the dinner table was not successful, ” said Coe.
Zigelman added: “It was very strange--
The peanut butter is completely out of reach.
This was characteristic of many household prescriptions.
More than ever before and ever since, housekeeping professionals — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Homekeeping from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become budget-makers to take up the challenge and convert the bourdes of a sort of powdered spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
“ A dust meal is a glistening of curious historical facts.
Especially picky stories about the Government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's position in a spirit of being eaten pies.
Publicly outnumbering Iowa's simple farm stride during his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire to whom he had become.
“ He liked continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce, ” Cou explained.
He ate almost in a gilded dining-room, wearing tufts.
He was fantastically cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if Eleanor's wife had not suggested that he set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was totally uninterested in taste, which resulted in the White House - using not only the most depraved food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most repugnantly prepared -
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Ziegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
Spouses tell us that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
“ She was seriously afraid of taking care of her food, ” said Cow.
Zigelman recalls: “She poisoned the people with a whole lot of...
There's been one bad case with the pilots.
When the plates in Eisenberg's fell, Coe and I got dessert, which was made at home: dessert from the inkhouse that President Roosevelt was eating for lunch.
“ It’s called an inkworm muss, ” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a spread acceptance to give humble recipes to bros names.
There were no crushed plums, only ink, some flour, some sugar, some water and some cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to drop a spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
To the surprise, it was good.
Kow asked for more on two occasions.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to the wife: “Several rubed walnuts would not have been prevented here -
Arrest of the persons involved in the mass fight in the Hovan Cemetery extended until 14 November
The Court of Presny left a case of mass strife in the Khovan Cemetery until 14 November, under the arrest of the figures, and granted the request of the investigation.
There are 14 persons in the case who are accused.
Recall that on 14 May, a massive fight took place in the Hovan Cemetery by several hundred Central Asians and the North Caucasus, which killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuevu, and the co-founder of the social organization, the High Nation, to Alexander Bocharnikov, were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Olga Goldez Government during his visit to Brian State.
We have specific parameters for how much pension it takes to defuse the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Economists are now taking stock of the half-year, and we will be completing this work in the next two to three weeks - - quoted by the Golden-Interfax -
Commenting on the six-year improvement scheme proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Cudrin, the vice-premier reported that the topic was not addressed in the cabin.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexing of pension payments in 2017.
Stone and Grigoryan went to the final shooting competition in a small-calibre rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Cyril Grigorian entered the final shooting competition from a small-calibre rifle at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first is the new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigoryan became second - 628,9 was.

Turkish opposition to Fethullah Güllen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
- I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempt at a coup d'état - - cited by the French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opposition said that if any part of the charges were confirmed, I would return to Turkey --
But Güllen denies all involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
Recall that an attempt at a military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will recover legal fees during the dispute for a patent from hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to compensation for legal fees incurred in connection with the patent for hepatitis medication with Merck & Co Inc., the Federal District Judge.
In June, Guilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents relating to Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical acts.
When the judge of the U.S. Federal District Court, Beth Labson Freeman, appeared before the court on Thursday, he said that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the costs incurred during the appeal.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which is the basis of a sophosbutir, an active ingredient of the Gilead drug company.
The United States-supported armed forces claimed to have taken full control of Manbidj from the Islamic State
The United States-supported armed forces seized full control of northern Manbidj near the Turkish border, after the last remaining militants of the Islamic State left, reported the group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of militants who had fled the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, and told Reiter-Sharfan Darwish of the Manbidja Military Council allied with VTS.
- The city is under our control now, but we're doing cleanup operations - - he told the Reiter agency -
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton issued his 2015 tax declarations on Friday, showing that the presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly from the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for speaking, while the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency, ” said Clinton Jennifer Palmieri, an adviser to election headquarters.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and breaking his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
This is a normal case for U.S. Presidents to publish their tax declarations, although they do not require a law to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service ' s review a reason for his refusal to publish his tax statements.
♪ Your move ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Twitter ♪ ♪ A advisor to the election staff of Clinton Jan Sams ♪
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the tests were complete.
Trump’s critics, including the presidential candidate of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitt Romney and other Republican fellows, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton grasped the issue and released an online video on Friday, which featured prominent Republicans who encouraged Trump to publicize tax reporting.
On Thursday, she raised this issue at the time of the Michigan economic talk.
“He refuses to do what he has done every single presidential candidate for decades without exception: publish his tax declarations,” she said to the meeting.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business observer for the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants who believed that maybe things would still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, investor of Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
In a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he's also under the IRS check, and Trump's afraid, not tax collection agencies, but voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations up to 2007.
Clintons now living in Chapaqua, New York, paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost food index fund, and Clintons claimed dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powdered condoms and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzania’s environmental enemies have used an unconventional way to prevent elephants from entering settlements to throw powder - filled chili condoms into them.
The method proved effective and the Honyguide Foundation, which was the focus of this idea a few years ago, joined with the American Committee for the Conservation of Nature in training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step, way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
“As we have invented a set of tools ..., we see a change in relationships within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants in their fields without harming elephants” said the executive director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the broken elephant and to signal through the horn.
If he can't be scared away, they throw away the so-called Chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with soil is placed in a condom with the cotton, and its end twists, leaving only the phyllum outside.
When a condom is lit, it is spun with gravy, spraying fine powdered chili powder in the air.
It is usually enough to deploy an elephant in the other direction.
The last measure is a launch device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey since the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data brought the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu, into a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 human resources diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons and explanations,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that in July, a coup d ' état was attempted in Turkey.
The authorities officially declared that the coup had failed, as well as the detention of over 6,000 persons, including higher- and middle-level military personnel.
The coup attempt killed 290 people according to the Turkish Ministry of Internal Affairs.
A Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s phone code by asking the Arabs to send RT News
A French director of Jewish origin had launched a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli phone code list, while employees referred to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary, Shoa, expressed his frustration at the Kampinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the Hotel, Lanzman attempted to find Israel on the hotel's telephone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to call directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was disfellowshipped and eradicated?
It's Lanzman's.
In return, the Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In the search for an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration's rack.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, shocked him --
Klerk of the hotel said that the measure was a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels Network.
The reason behind this step was even more angered by the director.
“The majority of our Arab guests, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed” said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as “frightly disgraced, ” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and it's on this hotel network, is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for clarification here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,' said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel was simply--it was about the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“ To be ashamed, ” said another post, stating that a hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendam Street was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried to withdraw any charges, calling the incident “unsuspecting” and “excuseing” before Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
“ There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of speedy recruitment — ” quotes the representative of the Kempinski Hotel newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students faced the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest the government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers attempted to disperse the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 government secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing on graffiti walls against the temporary Acting President, Michael Themer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protestors came out on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Russef when the country's Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Russia - Iran trade rose by 71%, reporting RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagaryan of Russia.
As international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there was a growing interest by Russian firms in the conduct of business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, Russia-Iran trade increased 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists to Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year’s record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend that we visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Ized, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition ” he said.
The State continues to roll the hooks into the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was - systematic failure - orders from principal - Almas - Anthei - - job failure - and - loss of confidence -
The NGO leader has been appointed Gennady Benderski for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Nesprodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not generate widespread resonance in the media.
What can be explained by such silence in the context of a massive rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the RF leadership does not want any rumours or negative assumptions to spread in the public environment.
This further confirms that the defence and industry complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
Disruption of Nesrodov is, of course, an important event in terms of industrial order.
The NGO-Almaz is a central enterprise in the production of marine and land-based man-made air defence systems (MOUs).
At present, Almaz is in the process of setting up the ZRC-Polimation-Reedet-and-Morfei, which are planned to be installed for new corvettes, frigates, esminets and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitri Cornev, believes that Nesrodov's dismissal is due to a breakdown in the timing of the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of the Morfea began as early as 2007, and the introduction was expected to take place in 2013.
- Polyment-Redut - should become the main air defence system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I have received, in several years no truly successful test has been performed.
True, as far as I can judge, there is no clear blame for it, \"Almaza,\" said Cornev.
The expert is concerned that the delay in entry into service may also occur with the ZRA-C-500 -
The project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first sets are to enter the military.
In the Ministry of Defence, it is assured that the work is planned and that everything will be completed within the established time frame - although in 2014 the department acknowledged that there were problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate Nesrodov’s professional qualities, who led - Almas - since 2011.
Cornev noted that the disruption of project deadlines could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, in recent years it had become extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in RBPs and enterprise management plans.
The industry has received long - term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a general rule, the director of defence companies resigns on their own wishes, on an agreement of the parties or is transferred to other positions.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, even though it did not receive resonance.
This suggests that the head of the Almaza may have been a trapper and resisted the top-down barrages -
It appears that such conduct is no longer the intention of the State to tolerate.
It will remove those who prefer to argue with the institutions of the Ministry of Defense and fail to perform the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the provoking authorities (magnifications on the ship ' s Star.
The President himself is giving a high degree of attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrialization Commission and periodically meets on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of the PKK managers in an effort to have, at hand, a loyal staff of directors who will carry out the orders received from the top.
This is a far-reaching policy, but against the backdrop of the prevalence of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CPC, the State does not have other instruments.
The defensive situation is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “clean-up” management of the PKK, the RF leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army ' s staff has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Defence.
It seems that the President has taken the famous talk, \"You want a world, ready for war.\"
During the cold war, the Soviet Union military power and the nuclear parity that had been achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which held the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked very well.
The lack of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof of that.
The victory fighting has resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism in the cold war.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S., perhaps no peaceful corner was left in the civilized world.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
Increased military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to step up new world policies.
The Scottish Callum Skinner walks in the final straight, forcing the British to take over the bicycle gold
The Scottish Kallum Skinner swung to triumph at the male command line at the Rio bicycle last night, protecting the British command trio from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old man named Glasgow was the strongest man who his fellow Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by walking through the final straight line to break the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to a surprise victory four years ago, winning Hoi's claim of the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after being made up modestly by the sixth world champions at the London demand champions at the March World Cup, despite Hoi's having completed his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by the participant Jamie Staff.
They did it just when Hindes came along.
Hoy's exit also created the void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, and he saw the potential of the Scottish who was now being realized.
Hendes, Kenny — champions with Hoi four years ago — and Skinner set the Olympic record, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hendes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hides drove more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the pedestal.
A 23-year-old Skinner, of Glasgow, said: “It's a nice comparison.
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admittedly fell on track after a failed start.
He later rejected the commentary, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such thing this time in the greatest victory.
Hendes said: “I felt like London, with all those British flags on the stand —
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost on so many races with the world's name that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of 10 race names in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the bicycle will be waiting for another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it's not beyond an opportunity to imagine how he repeats Hoy's victory by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years old, who was also born on 23 March (which seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), bringing up to six gold medals and one silver medals.
It would be like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, \"I just enjoy it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win one, if you're honest.
He said, \"If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get a knighthood.\"
It was the only one in a day to play medals, but there was some good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dooll have the fastest four-mile command race.
They paid for 3:51.943.
The world record of winning the London gold in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 evenings) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be the focus of exactly.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, on the eve of his qualifications, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trottt, Joanna Rousell Shend, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavi improved the world record by showing time 4:13,260.
The U.K. Command came to rely on a powerful cyclist team to own the average Olympic game period and earn a lot of medals.
After indeed exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations diminished in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were second-hand dramas, not last, the resignation of Cheine Sutton, technical director, in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the care of large figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night race at the bicycle, it seems that Britain’s legendary glory now in reaching the summit at the right time may be repeated once again.
Future of the Portland steellurgical plant at risk due to the termination of the electric power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to a factory owner, is about to terminate the delivery contract: all contracts are expected to be terminated.
This step is the consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant expires in November for 20 years.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at Alcoa plant in Portland.
Whole 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry metallurgical plant in 2014, resulting in the closing of the Englesy power plant last year.
The Portland metallurgical plant of Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have been the result of reflection on the future of a plant that has lasted for several years, initially because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the factory ' s price.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valli, reported that it was expected that the other three owners would also take steps to cancel the contract.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term enterprise Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
The AGL campaign expects the Portland facility to continue to work, i.e. the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not cease - it stated.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called \"heged contracts\" that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts had a twelve-month break-out period, and would thus in fact end in 2017.
“Usually, AGL is still expecting these contracts to generate part of its revenue in fiscal year 2017,” said the electric power company.
Any potential impact on the profits of AGL since fiscal year 2018 has been limited to strong futures forecasts for electric wholesale prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced its reporting amount by $187 million in terms of pre-disbursement,
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts - does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to a metallurgical plant -
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts each year.
If both of these factories leave the market, a significant reduction in [electric] demand will occur.
It will be bad for us as a producer,” he said.
Not only the Kardashian Realitis Star, Kendall on the cover of Vogue September
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of Mother Manager Chris, appeared on the mastered September Vogue magazine cover.
Kendall, who is the face of a brand by Estee Lauder and has defiled the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
“ While in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and wept, ” Kendall wrote.
News of the cover was accompanied by strange news (or just in the spirit of the Kardashian family?), a reality video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshira Rob and Caitlin, who had joined them with the most universal favorite uncle of the show business, the producer of the Kardashian Family Ryan Sy cross), forgot about the sister's appearance on the cover and, at the end, the classic turn of the story: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all of the episodes of children's television shows devoted to birthdays (Sikrus is saying, \"You thought we forgot about you -- with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get the fame to the other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the Vogue of September, we have certainly entered the new era of Kardashian.
Let Senior Sister Kendall Kim get on the Vogue cover sooner (she appeared with her husband, Kanya West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
September is the most sold Vogue issue in the year.
The volume is much more like a gift magazine than a fashion magazine, and it attracts a large number of advertisers. (Fashionista portal estimates, 615 pages from last year's 832 pages contained advertisements).
News of which of the stars will fall on his cover is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years the pictures of the magazine have fallen to the official annotate.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more on the cover — reputations that are modelled — than models that are celebrities —
The Oscar Prize winner and the brand face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga fell out.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an emerging model -- her generation -- falls into the first category, she's a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, of reality shows, or of modern children who know how to make good videos in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women in the entertainment industry.
For Bayons, on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone's happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, because of her past star of the television reality show, should always have been a joke.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Giji Hadid, called them momentary suckers.
These moods were re-enrolled after news of Jenner appearing on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to get caught up in frustration.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue September.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiled for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder's fine cream.
She, as well as all her sisters, sells you their photos in their own applications, which are available on paid subscriptions.
She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, LOVE.
And in her free time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's participating in a reality TV show.
Public legal centres deny service to 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected people refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut back funding on already existing opportunities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unjust deprivation of property, and so forth — have already been denied, seeking free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services that already operate outside of capacity are preparing for further reductions.
The legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding from June of the following year.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Centers, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centers, thousands of people have been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not reversed, things would get worse.
“The Queensland public legal centres were constantly receiving insufficient funding, which meant that thousands of people were denied essential services,” he said.
People out of violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers, all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, and thus thousands of less protected Queensland residents will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon Justice Minister and Senator Queensland George Brandis to cancel these funding cuts immediately so that people can obtain the necessary assistance when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raising funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to draw attention to the needs of the public legal centres and the community, their clients, and the Palascuk Government is about to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters was put in court after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun
According to New York, Donald Trump's election headquarters was tried: it was alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after being informed that his operating director in North Carolina had threatened to gun a staff member while they were driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday before the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that it wouldn't happen -
The director, Earl Phillip, is using a gun, puts his right index finger on his jacket, and put the dowel on Vincent's knee cup — this is what Bordin says in a complaint.
After regretting the local and regional office for election, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Philip, an appeal was received.
“ Pistols don’t have to shoot to cause harm, ” said Bordini in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate had brought the Fur, told North Carolina listeners that “the people of the Second Amendment” — known as the possessors of arms and his lovers — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
Trump's previous election headquarters said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the Electoral Staff for negligence and from Philip for threatening physical violence, insulting actions and causing moral harm.
Trump's representative Hope Heeks is slow to respond to the request for a comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left election headquarters.
In response to a call from his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one quickly called.
The Republican Party candidate Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, High Court Division, Mecklenburg District (Sharlott).
Britain must turn the Olympic spirit into the proper course and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring resurgence and prosperity not only in our places of origin and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
I think that was the greatest advantage of Heathrow, just like London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games were of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again, creating opportunities for locals and firms next to Heathrow.
For our settlements here alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case in London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expansion of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult world.
Skeptics were mistaken in 2012 and will be found to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which introduced a programme of £11 billion in infrastructure investment in a timely and within budgetary manner, from T5 selected by the best terminal of the airport for five consecutive years to T2 built in the middle of the two world's most occupied airstrips.
They are now ready to provide for the third airstrip, which has been confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for Great Britain, and I'm sure that Heathrow's expansion will be.
The time has come for us to send the Olympic spirit in the right direction and to expand Heathrow, ensuring our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain will be proud of.

Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-flies - on the issue of advertising blocking
For companies that make money on an Internet commercial, trying to bypass advertising software is a cat-mash game -- according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that they were going to block advertisements on their desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog entry saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site was changing the rope around its advertisement so that advertising blockers would find it more difficult to identify the parts of the page as advertisements.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “a kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those trying to bypass it has been continuing since the invention of the blocking of advertising” and that Facebook may be presenting its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the largest social networking network in the world has entered the struggle is a clear indication of how big the problem has become advertising blockers for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising lockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of people using this software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who go to Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's revenue from advertising.
However, the company is hunting advertising on the desktop because mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
Still, advertising in the desktop is quite a profit story to make Facebook feel like such a step in a lucrative investment.
Also, on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its advertising preference tool to give people more control over how advertising was traded on them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new Adblock filters were a matter of concern because they would also block some unimaginable content on the site.
- It's not going to be a good experience for people, and we're planning to solve this problem, - said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so instead we focused on creating tools like Advertising preferences to hand over governance to people.
A woman was moved on a Swiss highway to a scene of apparent suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses, after a woman has moved several vehicles on the freeway early on Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morse in the canton of Wo immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman went on the road in the dark - a gesture of despair - and she was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In an act of killing herself, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the ground.
Several involved drivers had already been interviewed, but some had not yet been identified, and the police had told them that they and others who had witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a logical step in this situation was made by counsel, Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will bring charges.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
This is what the prosecutor must determine,” said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway, it was ruled that motorists could not expect to meet the pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death because of negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Payerne at night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, hearing a trial.
The court found that a female police officer — who responded to the urgent challenge — was driving a vehicle that was justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was — an exceptional and unpredictable situation — said the judge.
Anyone who owns the accident information on Thursday, near Morse, should call the police for 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to an estimate of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Earth's Goddard Space Institute developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if there were any conditions in Venus, with its hot, waterless surface, and carbon dioxide-saturated atmosphere, such as Earth's.
It was previously assumed that the rapid rotation of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could possibly have had a dislodged atmosphere like the Earth, and it could still be slow to rotate.
The model also considered an early Venus topography.
The planet was likely to have more dry regions than it was on Earth, but it once had enough water and sufficient geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent carcasses.
According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus sets her on the front of the sun for almost two months at a time -- explained a GISS scholar Anthony Del Henio in a press message.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella protecting the planet's surface from much of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly several degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to that previously assumed by planet scientists.
Despite the fact that Venus may once have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen ran out, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the Journal of Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving Avalanche as coach
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of hockey business Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President, Chief Commander of the Colorado team, Joe Sack, confirmed the news and noticed that the club was starting to look for a new trainer immediately.
“For the past three years, I have been fulfilling my duties as Chief Coach and Vice-President of Hockeys Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of the hockey industry must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Axe, who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Patrick told me about his decision today, \"\" said Sack.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award winner during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost to play playoff for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an estimate of 39-39-4 during the 2015-2016 season and five points were left behind by Wild in the fight for the second concessionary trip to attend the Western Conference.
A gatekeeper from the Hall of Glory, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with Montreal Canadiens and an Avalanche.
North Sea petroleum workers resume negotiations and suspend the strike
The working strikes on the North Sea oil wage have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion have embarked on a new round of negotiations, and the lead representatives of the parties have reported.
Strikes against Wood Group's oil-service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process for the settlement of current disputes — as stated in the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh outlook.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, was against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to North Sea contract workers by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The decline in the company ' s rates followed a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the banks in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give it the space needed to overcome the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries by up to 10 as it rationalized its activities as a result of its mega-slip with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower oil prices: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by Great Britain.
Scottish member Dave Anderson of Parliament met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for a regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea in 2016, as opposed to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of the stars in the Pleiade
The final mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of the rotation speeds of the stars forming part of the Pleiade cluster.
New data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
- We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star and its age and even the history of its solar system - she told the press by Louise Riball, an expert at the Center for Infra-red Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades are 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only mature; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They turn as fast as they'll ever be again.
At their peak speeds, these grown stars throw out large quantities of star wind.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds exert braking effects on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between recognized stars — such as sunspots.
A newer rotation speed directory suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Fishing compares stars to dancers: bigger ones make pirates slower than smaller ones.
“Balete — The pleiade we see is that those that spin slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster usually refer to very light stars,” said Riball.
Since the cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars with the speed of rotation.
“ The star clustering of the Pleiades provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both junior and older, ” says Riball.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down the speed of their rotation and hang their dance shoes on their nails -- literally speaking.
The fishermen and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation into the activities of a group of detained Ukrainian divers in the Crimea is carried out by two authorities, written by Kommersant'a
In the FSB, evidence of the detainees ' involvement in the preparation of diversions to the Crimea is collected.
As previously reported, confessions were given by the resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
He said that as objects of diversion, he had considered the Titan - dry plant in Armeniansk, the oil base in Theodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and a military airfield.
Law enforcement officials believe that it has not been possible to apprehend all the dissidents.
This, in particular, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Paradise of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cherchezov was the main coach in the assembly of Russia.
The meeting of the Russian football union decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the lead coach of Russian assembly football.
The contract will be for two years, pending the completion of PM-2018.
On 11 August, the F.F.S. took the lead coach in assembly Russia for Stanislav Cherchezov's football.
It's a well-known football player who used to play Moscow-Sportac in the gatekeeper's position, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of Russian teams such as the same one, Spartak-Soczy-Gercina-Terek-Amkar-Dinamo, and Warsaw-Legya, who became the winner of national primacy and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchezov will be signed as soon as possible for a period of two years.
It is therefore incumbent on him to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
His training staff are known to include Miroslav Romašchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pankov.
There is information that the total wage for training staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the RFF’s leadership has set the goal of bringing Russia’s congregation to semi-final and winning the medals.
As the trainer has said, as a matter of priority, he sees the creation of a competitive environment on the team and is going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Chercheszov, he's glad that his choice fell on him.
The first match, under the leadership of Cherchezov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya -- it will be a friendship with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutzky, who combined him with the training at the CIAC club, was the former coach of the Russian football team.
He announced his resignation following a failed statement by the Russian National Team to Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of the gathering.
Congested between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made enormous strides, especially in the last few years.
Namibia ' s main reason for its success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as themselves, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools pay fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce cost-saving training -
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent in the last 10 years.
In spite of the international trend of inequality, Namibia is decreasing.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, the standard income inequality, has dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also fallen, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to data from “Reporters without Borders”
The United States and other rich nations have far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable ranking - one of the highest in Africa - in the Perception of Corruption Index - that is, human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices fall, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the ratio of debt to GDP is about 25%, less than 1/3 of debt in the United States and most of the European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least in the traditional methods of evaluation, remains fairly high - nearly 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, almost 17 per cent of the population is infected in Namibia.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is a higher-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties faced by the underdeveloped economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the deserts, the country is home to isolated hunting tribes, which must be integrated in modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter century ago is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, and the country solved the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of health-care providers in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia spoke of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that their neighbors were not chosen but therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and student exchange.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth revenues need to be invested in infrastructure and capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum return on the country ' s resources, and to review investment laws and mining contracts in order to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial for that process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of expression was so important.
As Hage Geingob, Head of State, noted, the media often say that they don't like it.
But following the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has received, says the President.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, were renewable, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even countries that are beginning with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on a path of shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many heard about the “Golden Varna — ancient gold objects created by man (4600 - 4,200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps this was the greatest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: a fantastic quantity of gold artefacts — more than 3,000 in total weight 6 kilograms — was discovered in Bulgaria at the excavations of the Varennes Necropolis.
Of the one burial known as May No. 43, 990 gold items were recovered with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient gold of the world can soon be traced back to the ignominious bushine found by archaeologists this July.
Again in Bulgaria, a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Junacyte.
Unlike Varna, a port town, Tell Junacyte is located far away from the sea near the village of Yunakita of the Pazardzik district.
Busina is a gold strip facing into a ring.
Jawor Boyajyev, the excavation leader at Tella Yunacyt, dated to the discovery of 4600 B.C. and stated that she was more than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
Barnabas ’ treasures, it is remembered, date from about the same period, 4600 to 4,200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology that can accurately date metal.
How can you be sure of how much more ancient gold is?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told the Reuters agency: “I am pretty sure that Yunakite is older than Varna’s gold.
It's an extremely important finding: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojajiev, scientists would soon examine the composition of the metal and re-examine and more thoroughly examine the archaeological layer where a gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location of the finds also explains a lot.
Tell Junacyte is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of him.
At present, Tell Junacyte is considered Europe’s oldest city.
The Tella was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7,000th century B.C.E.
Metal processing has developed rapidly in the region over the next centuries, from the development of early metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
The national history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkans-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the five thousand years before this era around metal processing centres, urban-type settlements began to emerge.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
Of these, Tell Junacyte may be the oldest because the artifacts were found here 4900 B.C.
I'd call Tell Junacyte a prototype of a modern city, although this is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
- This is a thousand-year-old senior place - - Bojajiev says, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
The first cities came into existence in the familiar understanding of the word.
The United Nations has been digging up since 1976.
Since then, archaeologists have excavated nearly 12 hectares, about one third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of the fortress wall were found that once reached three meters high.
Few houses and workshops remained, but archaeologists clearly distinguished the streets, public buildings, urban dams, business centres, and residential areas.
Tens of clay bird figurines have been found here, often called the Bird City.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, and it is assumed that they were, not decorative objects, but the object of local worship.
The bird town was destroyed about 4100 B.C., possibly by the Indian tribes of the north-east.
Travellers had no towns, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-metre fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of a brutal slaughter, with remains of old men, women, and children found inside the houses with marks of wounds inflicted by combat resistance.
New findings and new facts are emerging every year, changing the traditional ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not of individual cultures, but of the lost, first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for civilization was the gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury had to be preceded by something like a tiny golden bush in Tella Junacyt.
Porsche has artificially aged 911 Targa.
Officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared by hand-operated unit specialists working with serial machines.
\"Retro Luk\" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, and even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa has received a fancy white schedule along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some body design details painted in white-gold metal -
The interior of the retro-charter is markedly smaller: it differs, in large measure, from sero-blue gammas, to new chairs with extended bands of electro-regulators and black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo separated.
In addition, each buyer will be given a car Chehol for a special version and a richly separated album with pictures of the production process.
The power plant of the Porsche Exclusive injury was not the same as that of the retro targae as in the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 litres developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be produced with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sportsman is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have deployed the arms race . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented advertising from being hidden on the Socsset pages, provoked decision makers to block advertisements from responding.
At AdBlock Plus, they've released the opposite -- but Facebook is planning to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short while.
In an effort to deceive new technology - unblocked advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertisements, has also blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, they regretted this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to resolve the problem soon.
As explained by the source of TechCrunch community developers, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's destop site will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the social media and the blockaders have unleashed a kind of arms race — trying to play each other, and users who have missed an interesting record from friends or have seen advertisements where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently given rise to heated disputes.
In Murmansk, the abuser will be tried by a court of law, such as Mr. Murmansk.
His case had already been completed in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murman region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: assault of a sexual nature.
The investigation found that in late November 2015, the accused in the Pavlov Street area in Murmansk carried out violent sexual acts against a 20-year-old girl.
This article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia a cross-country Fengguang 370 and a pickup of Rich New to drive www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China's popular car class, combining the dignity of a minivan and a crossword.
Another declared Russian prime minister, Rich New.
Many Western firms in Moscow International Motorway this year have decided to ignore, so the emptyness of the Expo showrooms will fill China’s firms.
In particular, the Longfeng Motor Corporation, with large types on the Russian market, will be a powerful front and intends to offer some interesting news to our motorists in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China in the spring at a price of $55,900 (about less than £550,000 at current rates).
The question of transfers to our country is unlikely to be apparent to the Russians, and the issue of transfers is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 as a result of the June sale was able to reach 11th on the list of the most sold minivans, although in view of the large road light (175 mm) and the protective plastic pad on the lower perimeter of the body, it is quite possible to assign it to the crosssellers.
Crosswen is built on the front-line of the Fengguang 360 younger model, with a base of 2725 mm in the 370's, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), design is stronger and equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden planks, but shown in the photo with a large vertical sensor screen like Tesla's, on the central console was only on the early shows of the crossword, and the machines with music were sold in a easier way.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed of a flat loading area 1650 mm in length, and a maximum of 1,500 litres in size.
The Fengguang 370 engine is only one, 1.5-litre petrol-atmosphere, a power of 115 L.S. with a 5-stage mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer modestly misses the vehicle's dynamic qualities, but promises the owner's spare budget at 6.7 litres/100 km.
Bishop Rich New is a well-known Russian NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly blasphemous Chinese stylist design.
Despite the morally outdated design, the model still uses the stable demand for a Chinese consumer as a reliable and non-desirable -- labor horse --
At a similar price, Rich New is probably interested in the Russians, because today's Japanese pickups are extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose either petrol 2.4 litres (137 litres) or turbodiesel 2.5 litres (116 litres).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigid front connected
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedant A9, its Russian Prime Mission to the Chinese firm, annotated as early as June.
Minveno-like crossovers on the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Longfeng ruler consists of two models: the S30 sedana and the H30 Cross hitchbeck.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese firm were operating 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices stop sending by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the order in which notice of property taxes was sent.
All Russian auto-owners are used to a year's unmodified scheme: in the summer and autumn, they receive a receipt by mail to pay for the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not wait this year.
The fact is, the tax inspection has changed without much noise the manner in which citizens are notified.
Those who are registered in the Tax Payer's Office - on the official website of the agency nalog.ru - messages will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and to have them removed from standard paper distribution.
The newness affects all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive routine letters.
However, the ability to return to the old scheme is also available to users of the account on the website.
This would require them to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notice will appear in the office as soon as the writing is completed, while the letter will go for days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service oversaw 18 million, which would enable the agency to save seriously on mail.
On the other hand, modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changes in order.
Some people could register in a private office for one-time services and have forgotten about it for a long time.
These people will not wait for the notice by mail and will be classified as non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Tax Payer's Office is provided in three ways: through the record of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or entry of the logon and the password specified in the registration card.
The latter may be obtained in person from any tax inspection office (independent of the location of the registration).
It is recalled that this year the transport tax has to be paid by 1 December.
The dispatch of the notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, where improvements are meant to achieve very high returns, is something in themselves.
But the controversial concept did not confuse G-Power artists who had undertaken to modify Mercedes-AMG G sport.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human about its artists is alien.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571 - strong flying carcase with tank air dynamics and up to a hundred - 5.4 seconds?
Inflated musculles, a crazy Helica, the master took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-litre supercharge-eight opens--
But the momentum of the race up to a hundred has improved on the indifferent 0.1 seconds, and now the flying brick is capable of a flow of 5.3 seconds.
However, medium speed accelerations are certainly better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h, the tuned all-way with a deactivated electronic collar is capable of extruding 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel drives - 23-Dummy Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxuriant unit annotated an impressive 6-metre concept compartment to be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with green subbrand - BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade name.
In the coming years, a minimum of four ecological innovations are expected.
