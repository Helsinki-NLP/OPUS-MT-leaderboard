President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law establishing administrative responsibility for violating the time and order for payment of goods (work, services) for public and municipal purposes.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of the employer ' s failure to fulfil its obligations in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs were unable to pay for public and municipal contracts that had already been completed was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia had instructed the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to cope with unfair customers who had entered into funded contracts, tried to evade the obligation to pay and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect entrepreneurs ' rights to payment under public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has made 9,000 submissions, as a result of which 45,000 officials have been held disciplinaryly responsible, and 533 administrative officers have been prosecuted, 75 materials submitted to the investigating authorities for the conduct of the proceedings, and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts were not accumulated as a result of the failure to pay multi-billion dollar contracts.
The Bosnian debt has resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
This is a typical case.
The manager of a small company won several million roubles to provide social transport services.
The person has invested all his working capital, has fully complied with the obligations, but has not received the amount of money in due course.
The result is a build-up of debts on salaries, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the business did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total public and municipal debt identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates in manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General shall personally meet with local authorities to deal with all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures to remedy them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavla and Yekaterinburg.
The Federal Act No. 189-FZ - amending the Code of Administrative Offences on Administrative Offences to establish administrative responsibility of the employer ' s officials for violating the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the execution of the purchase to provide for public and municipal needs - signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was drafted by the Russian Ministry of Development on the initiative of the General Prosecutor ' s Office.
The new law would supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article that provided a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for infringement by an official of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurements.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is expected to be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit announced a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Population has issued a warning to colour people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: “Prevention to travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Colored Population, effective until 28 August 2017, calls upon African-American travellers, visitors and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in their State travel in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the state and here”.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Population, the announcement of a warning to move led to a recent law in Missouri that made it harder for people to win discrimination claims and that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately chose minority groups.
“You people are being violated by human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of colour, beaten and killed,” reports the newspaper Cansas City Star, by Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
\"We hear complaints often more than ever.\"
This is the first such warning declared by the organization against the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gasoline during his visit to the state, and the Missouri State police arrested him without bringing charges of crime.
The Prevention also mentions a recent report by the Attorney General of the State of Missouri that the possibility of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
“People shall be prepared in one way or another, whether they take with them money for bail or inform their relatives that they travel throughout the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime programme, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri for 2015, making the State sixteenth in the State of its hate crimes.
The prevention of movement is also a response to a new law in the State of Missouri, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Protection Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after they had enacted new immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violation of immigration laws, which the ACLU believed should have increased racial verifications.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but more recently, social organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired a police patrol at the Egyptian city of Izna, reports Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed and three wounded during the shooting.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men who were in the car were fired at law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested and the other managed to escape.
Racism supports the law on the repeal of free baggage for non-returnable air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel, which was very positive in the enactment of a law to repeal free shipping of luggage on return tickets.
“It is important to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage — he stressed (quoted by TASS).
In the meantime, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the concern of the citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of the outer garment and mobile phone in the handcuff.
“It would be proper to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say it’s to the upper clothes, to the umbrellas, to the mobile phone, to the aypeda, or even to some computer that won’t have a relationship,” said the head of Rosturism.
Previously, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the provision for free transportation of luggage on a non-returned airline ticket.
This means that airlines can themselves determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in a non-returnable tariff.
Vladimir Putin has commissioned the elimination of Baikal pollution
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution in recent years.
It had requested the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned the complete recycling of contaminated areas.
- We also need to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-up of most of them is worn out - quote RIA News - President.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney-General of Russia should carry out an environmental screening.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with regard to natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not all checks in a row, there is also a need to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful, and to take appropriate measures,” he emphasized.
He had previously reported a reduction in the fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental surveillance.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin made a direct statement on the need to change legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territories to a special security regime.
Economic problems were reported to the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikala water conservation zone, but in the Government of Buryatia, recalled that such a change was not sufficient because restrictions were linked to a range of regulations.
Previously, the Minieconomics had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in Judaea
In the Soswa village, members of a community of indigenous and small peoples in North Rachtinya, together with the inhabitants of the Beresov district, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of the priest Nikolay the Miraclemaker.
Its location is a riverbank, and the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a traveling lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, and there are now domes installed, and there are church circles available.
The fleet's German REB carried out a transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miraclemaker because he is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a patron, including fishermen.
In the same amount, fishing gives settlers jobs, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open their doors, and children even write in their school writings about it as a place of appreciation.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang, sitting in an open air snack.
While commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, he carefully stacks his skins into an iron box that he holds with him from the office.
At the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, a 100 - foot [100 m] meter, and throws the bulls out.
It's 500 local dollars for garbage in the public place, says Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid: I can't throw a candy fan on a bridge, and I'm just being fine.
And now there's video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's pavements in the center of the city are clear, like in a museum.
Chang says three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to porn.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows by wooden stick on his butt and spent a week in prison.
It's not uncommon for us to have corporal punishment.
Like Singapore, the highest standard of living and the most incredibly harsh laws, the surveyor-AiF at the site was the surveyor-AiF-
Nobody here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long neglected the views of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries or trades a large shipment of drugs, he is placed with a bridle.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changhi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even Pope Romani.
But the guy was finally hanged.
After that, our drug-smoking country is carefully raided by the party.
The case is: in Singapore, it is the responsibility of the laws to comply with the ALL in a row, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are, or who you are, or who you are, or who you are, or
One option in this case: if you find a coke, you'll be hanged.
When you walk through Singapore and meet all over the world with a bunch of warnings, you just wonder how many bans in this city-state are there!
For example, a chewing rubber is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be obtained strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
The visitor will not take the gum away, but should put the cut in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days I met two people with white groves on their neck: “I was garbage.
In addition to fines, handcuffs are often used to order a handcuff to the palaces — to clean parks and beaches for a week.
£6,000 is paid by the offender, who has forgotten to wash away water in the public toilet, and in an attempt to meet the little need for an elevator, a special detector operates to block doors and send a signal to the police.
Exotic laws include prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons in the street, the public execution of songs, and even the excessive flow of room plants (!): Insect water is believed to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers cannot be shot into the subway, otherwise they are fined 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
Anyway, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're going to break something.
It's not like that, because it's trying to trust me, Mohammed Kabir Kajariya, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years, I have not seen anyone involved in the violation.
Why keep them?
So that citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is rigorous.
Let's say that if they sell cigarettes in the kiosk, they're all chained up: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the intruder himself will be hit with the back stick, and the seller will be thrown and put in jail.
It is because of such severe laws that the offence in Singapore is very rare.
Is that justified?
As early as the seventies, we had the chaos of the roads - motorists ignored the light signals, drove as they wished, and sat drunk on the wheel.
After fines were imposed, everything calmed down in one year.
The driver now knows that if he stops, the police officer will not let go for bribes, impose a fine of the value of the apartment, and will be sent to the grid for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore - Disneyland with death penalty - a visitor from the U.S. was horrified by the general wealth of residents, the frighteningly clean airport - and the cultural nature -
It looks artificial to make such things look unnatural, and it doesn't have to be so in principle.
For the first days in Singapore, you're probably afraid to throw a boom on the pavement, you'll catch up if you walk into a subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area -- small India -- and suddenly, breaking the template -- the bus stop has plastic glasses.
And as such, you're surprised.
That's how the Singaporeans smile.
Everything happens.
Not for every crime like this, it will take place, but you must know that if you are calculated, you will not be ridiculed, but you have broken the law.
This is often enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore's power is authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hoshimin, I have moved very cautiously — motorcyclists often bring smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty boars and beggings.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw garbage into the mines either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth through a set of dragon fines and ruthless laws.
You'll think about it.
That is human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one has been in control until they have been fined.
Although Singapore's principal law enforcement was not fines, it was voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, with no trash on the subway, and would welcome the arrest of people who walk on an elevator with a public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment, thank you, don't do it.
The rest of Singapore's laws, however, are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting Stat Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no worse than the rest of the world, hence the deliberate demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue of Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the world's key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he had done when he took a symbolic look at Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with the journalist CNN Jim Acostosta on the presidential proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
We'll be honest, Miller didn't bite on the statue itself.
The holders of pleasure craft and Statutory Artists would be lynching him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus’ poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller stared at Acosta: “I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that is a dream to the world.
The training you're talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller made the right presentation of the facts, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about Lazarus, who is the only one in whom the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: 'You who have become tired, your poor, and your men who wish to breathe freely.
Never before have the waste been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't involved in literature, he made it clear that Trump was not waiting in America for these people.
This dispute about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus — and her friends, who fought to put her words on the cap on the statue after her death — were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and the American republics by means of a banal classic, the woman's image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, a female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nationalism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right thing to do is change it back.
In 2010, Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced Trump’s arrival, reasoned that freedom was not inviting anyone; rather, it was an early neo-Conservator carrying America’s flame to the darkness of peace: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries a freedom torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light up the way to the U.S.
Limbo's habit was really at the point.
The intent of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
A great creative achievement for Lazarus was to see her as would be seen by the distorted, unhappy, but full-fledged people on the decks of the ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This means literally looking to the world with people seeking asylum and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed, not to light the way, but to fuel the hatred that is their only source of strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the British Assembly.
Eiled Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottishs in the British Assembly.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Federation of Light Athletics, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Cup Assembly would make a significant contribution to the team's game -
The record number of Scottish pilots was selected for the 2017 London Champion on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is going on in Scotland, and the Federation of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom must take this into account.
- We know that and we're trying to understand and support it while they have the potential.
- I spoke to people at the Institute of Sports in Scotland, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athleticians thinks that what they've done needs to be worked on.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they have done is to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances are so good, but it's brilliant.
Some Scottish pilots claim medals, including Laura Mür and Andrew Bachert, which will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres, while Eilid Doyle selected his captain.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
Her captain's speech was great, Blake says.
Many of them, whether they are Scottish or not and where they live or train, have left this room in a sense of pride and a disposition to win.
The passion and genuine feelings Eilid had in her were wonderful --
A silver medal owner of the Commonwealth Championship, who, at his fifth World Cup, will run 400 metres with obstacles, says 16 Scottishs in the British Assembly -- it's not likely --
The previous record for the number of Scottishs in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mür, who specializes in medium-range flight, goes ahead last year, beating five British and two European high scores.
She'll run 1,500 feet and 5,000 feet.
Chris O'Hare, who will be in the run for 1,500 metres, is another Scottish who should be brought to the attention: behind his back, he had a good season, where he won the selection competitions at the British Assembly and the Annual Meeting.
Doyle recalls her first world champion, when her only Scottish team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's incredibly proud -- that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team but, in some cases, will claim medals and fight for the finale.
- Captain is elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and you were chosen, which is a very special thing for me, which she added.
Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish who joined the assembly.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all light-winged, striving for a pedestal of honour.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were so lucky to have the World Cup houses.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from painkillers and take advantage of the fact that we'll find ourselves in the Olympics again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere is going to be great.
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: do not put yourself in public office unless you are willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, \"you can take away the freedom of speech and of us, the deaf and the dumb, they can lead us like sheep to fight.\"
Now I'm going to go to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The subordinate governors called the action null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in a spirit of \"no\" and that \"
- It's just Facebook - many people will say.
But it's important too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a Hogan guy.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state-dominated state.
He's the second highest ranking candidate of the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactant.
He demonstrated his firm hand in managing the state and his commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with his voters and jokingly shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor's page - which is stated to be an official public forum and run by the administration on the taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply a modernization of them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and cheetahs angry on the Internet.
- Post - spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who addresses their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowi, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
- I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news - she wrote in her section on article in - Post -
- I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called scroll instead of recognizing that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens -
What the subordinate governors call a \"concentrated spam attack\" - others would probably call an \"active life position\" -
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticisms or cutting down negative comments.
This is much less than a dusty job when it comes to sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical leaders, or arresting and shutting the protestor's mouth.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were taken to his Twitter account.
One of the first turning points on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Cacheris of Alexandria, the President of the Laudon County Observatory violated the First Amendment by taking the voter into his account in the Facebook.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bavin of the Republic made claims to the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so hard.
At the time of the Washington, D.C., the Internet was about the same turnaround as it is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and anonymous writers severely violated his credibility.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under pseudonyms - Juricola - Valerius - Belicarius - and - Porcius - wrote letters in newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online project - George Washington ' s documents - his office was captured by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he wasn't trying to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
True leadership is in agreement.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic conveniences at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, former champion of Europe, hopes for domestic convenience for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lutian will adopt the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who was led by neighbor at Archerfield Links, moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ils, attached to a new location and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvady Club.
“I saw the Renaissance club being built, and we see it coming to fruition with this event,” said Rafferty.
\"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job in setting up this place.
He is a loyal committed player of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to taking the lead for the first time, despite the fact that his 32-year-old career has won both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
\"It's really a special feeling,\" said a player from Southport.
\"I couldn't try to re-win Extremadura Open, because it was taken from the calendar one year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great golf place.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was indeed a very special time, and we will always remember it.”
Go back to battle in the land of Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour for Older Sportsmen after 50 years earlier this year.
This event will be the first to appear in the public in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
\"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important,\" said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
“You want to speak well, but you feel the extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again, and I showed some good golf.
I am pleased with the way in which all things are being accomplished.”
Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty will join in the field.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrans are two of the six Scottishs in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmüir, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free, and parking costs £5 an hour if there's one person in the car and £10 if there's two or more.
All the revenue goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on Britain’s roads.
The country transport agency reported on the positive results of tests of 100 metres of tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The tunnel, six metres high, is constructed of some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, undertake a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the use of commercial transport on electric trains and upgrade heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsoud changed Mamyev's punishment to a fine
Mosgorsu changed the sentence of a disabled person, Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
TASS reports this.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor's Office had asked the court to replace the period for the conditional by explaining that Mamayev's illness prevented him from being in prison.
Anton Mamaev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a general regime for the robbery suffered by a former special forces fighter.
On 19 July, a court in a Sizo retreat released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden earth”
While preparing lunch, Bardin Degei does not use a tile.
She's not even a potter.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of the district of Pania in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called a note, right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the rinsed tubers are taken and eaten with their unendurable, impotent hands.
Degay is sitting on the ground floor -- there's no furniture -- and that's where she's doing her work at home, like washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The cleaning lady serves as a bucket in the room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her four husband's wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Multiplicity is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in the village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five o’clock in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands to the occupying forces.
The existing movement in favour of independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and Western Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; the road includes an hour and a half from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, in Nabir, and a five-hour shaking on a hired car.
There's no public transportation here.
A town with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of red walls.
There were few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope’s mee pago was worshiped as a god named Uga Tamei.
Other changes were made.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes, ” Degay relates, pointing to her bright, self - packed turban, dark coat, and bright shirt.
\"In the early days, we wore only leaves on the body.\"
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold ground.
The largest gold mine in the world and the world's most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran Phoenix, is only sixty miles from Panama, a tall province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced some $3.1 billion of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can boast a stock of trees valued at 78 billion dollars.
This wealth, however, brings one calamity to the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia are here maintaining their suffocating presence.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demand for greater autonomy by the Papuas threatens the existence of this golden dwelling and is ruthlessly repressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres of indigenous peoples in the highlands of Papua during the seventies could be considered genocide.
It was not until last year that the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,300 civilians protesting in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Eparchy, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture, especially the frequency claimed by another report, rape and electric shocks, and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is hard to count the number of victims because of the occurrence of each week,” says Andreas Harsono, researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Haitians had been prolonged as resources from Papua attracted the influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographic rate varies as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Java lavender, \"varungi\", sells roasted chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to compete.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the natives of Papua,” explains Abét Yow, a 20-year-old Panamanian who moved to Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, because of work.
“The indigenous people of Papua Moma (the woman) of Papua therefore lost their market”.
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to commit inequality and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of the 29 Papuan districts, including Panamanian.
But there is little change in Papua, and the natives feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” says Yoou.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokova Panias suffered a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and singing Christmas hymns at a basket in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlamps.
According to local pastor Jabedt Tebay, one of the soldiers had wronged them and returned with four soldiers after a while.
Victims and eyewitnesses said that soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifles.
Then one soldier shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the government's nearby Electoral Commission building, and the situation got worse the next day.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual bow hunters, and they performed the covenant, the dance of the Mee Paguas tribe, running in circles and portraying a bird’s singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation broke out, the soldiers were ordered, “If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them”, as claimed in an official document that was seen by TIME correspondents but was not published in the local media.
The fifty - six - year - old Eremias Kayame, the head of the Kō Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but he says the bullet came from the rings of the assembled soldiers.
\"There were a crowd, there were many shots,\" he adds.
A local resident, Alphaeus Jowa, has been hit three times as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” she scribbled, “Johanes told TIME magazine, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
\"I saw him dead... and I kissed him.\"
General Jotje Mende, chief inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because it was attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us”, said a representative of Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death”.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and far more wounded.
News of the killings reached Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks later Jokovi delivered a dusty speech in Jayapur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Viranto, the Minister for Security, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, the excuses went out.
“The majority of violations have been committed in a long time.
Some of them occurred at the nineties or at the beginning of the zeroes.
The point is, of course, that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,\" he said.
Wirranto then declined to speak to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “All will be judged.”
Virano, who was accused of “crimes against humanity” by the United Nations in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for East Timor's independence, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Panama met with a grim lack of confidence.
“ Over the past three years, I have been asked four times, but there has been no change, ” says Johanes.
\"I am tired.\"
He says years later he still lives in fear.
\"I'm scared,\" he says.
\"I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, afraid I'm going to be shot.\"
His brother Jacobus also suggested that the people of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
\"After we buried the bodies, the military came to me,\" he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighbouring district of Diyai in Panama.
During a clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take a man who was unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 20 - year - old man, Ravianus Dow, who had been drowning in fishing in a leaked river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the building site belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) fired at a crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” reported TIME magazine of 20-year-old Domingga Badiya, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded arrive hastily.
\"I hid at my house for two days.\"
The Day Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident call for a response and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Panama has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is due to the discontent of the Mee tribe, the Moni, the Dani and the Damals scattered throughout the area covered by the greenness of the Papua central highlands.
Many joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to be defending the rights of the Papuas by resorting to sporadic attacks and kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judaes Kogoya.
As a response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua Pania, it is regarded as “a hot, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases frustration.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The same amount of bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat, mainly notes, and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the harvest for the family and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tuber notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between indigenous Papuas and new migrants had increased, and they had arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights at Nabir airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually reached by better educated and more wealthy migrants.
Papias rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
\"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,\" says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media remained rigid.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esccudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequacy with the relevant organizations” despite being granted rare video coverage permits.
According to Felim Kee, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises of the Jokovi election campaign have not been met to promote transparency and development.
“In the meantime, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua face new dangers: denials of visa and blacklisting”, he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is mostly limited to immediate Papuan neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States, namely Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “different and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Panama.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanat Nassir, withdrew from the group ' s statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals broke the silence, saying, “We want freedom”, as the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will have a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuas say that it is unlikely that Jokovi will again vote.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Panama,” says Gobai, president of the Council of the tribe.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Pania, in addition to living in a shadow of a threat by the altar army, are poor, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobay says that the people of Panama, like the rest of the Papa's, consider their voice for Jokovi to be the debt he has to pay.
\"We don't need money, they just want justice,\" he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Panama led to the latest symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly opposite the police station and the military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never triumph, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
\"A member of our family was killed,\" says Jacobus without raising his head.
\"What else were we to do?\"
The second time, fire covers Fakel’s oak skyscraper
The fire struck one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the seven-tenth story structure at 337 metres high.
This is the second fire that took place in an elevated building, called Fakel in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and no operational news of the cause of the fire was provided.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of men.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to descend from the fiftieth floor,” reported George to Reuters.
According to the Civil Defence Authority of Dubai, fire brigades extinguished the fire at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time (00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident may return to the agenda the security issues of materials used in high-rise buildings exteriors around the world.
The investigation by Fakela after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most affected were the external panels used for handling and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the airlocks of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire that resulted in the death of some 80 people.
The increase in tourist flow to Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to data received by the reporter of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from hotel facilities in North-East in June 2017, an increase of 125 persons or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and foreign tourists have grown.
In June, for example, a foreign turf increased by 7.3% (544) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists dropped by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists increased most markedly in the region, by 8.9% or 318 persons, compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 RF guests stayed at the Ida-Virumaa Hotels.
Andrei Malahov made it clear to the worshipers who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malahov hinted at his worshipers in Instagram, who was responsible for his departure from the First Channel.
So far he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a fragment of a newspaper article entitled “Veducibility” in the August 1st year.
Photo Malachov signed tag - boss milks -
The article on how to prevent - burn out - the worker and pay attention to his condition.
If you remember the numerous reports that the lead couldn't find a common language with a newly arrived producer who's started to reformulate, and they tell us, it's clear that he's so transparently hinted, he's writing,
It was reported that the televiser Andrey Malachov was currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First Canal.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting RIA News.
According to the police, a mined car blew up the night before the military blockade in Girishk County.
We know 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new PPP took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The driver filmed a biting camera for him, a shark.
The driver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) recorded a video on a shark that bit his goPro target camera.
The Rolle put on Facebook a unit of the United States Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a staff member of the Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August on the coast of Cape Code Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, detailing the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera, which he held on a stick.
Noticing a man, an animal over three feet [three m] long came close to him.
Sharks tried to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
He explained that the predator did the same to determine whether or not the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also observed that such behavior was new to scientists.
A known cause of mass fighting in the Ural military centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District came to the Elan Training Centre to investigate the events of the incident.
Some details of the beating have already been learned.
According to Mash, appearing on VContakte, the Ural military contractors number 31612 were brutally beaten because of an unmanned bed.
It started with Sa'an's private demonstrative disregard for an officer's order to fill a tavern.
The officer's side was with the sixth company.
Sayana supported her first mouth.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys were smashed into a barracks of beds and shells, and glass was knocked out.
More than ten people were affected in the mass fight.
In the TSS, they refuted the information about the bearing.
The study found that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carried prohibited items into aircraft.
The study revealed that more than 20 per cent of passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the aircraft through inspection sites of the U.S. Department of Transport, including a minimum of 6 per cent of the aircraft, on the basis of supervision of prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally possessed firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered over 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more likely to break rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The most common rate of passing ATB personnel is through food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they specifically carried sharp items through the examination, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried illegal drugs into the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers all over the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport inspections and how many had done so deliberately.
Most of the time, it is expected, deliberately or unconsciously, that smuggle through the examination of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are rather complicated and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB takes is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider a book prohibited from being transported.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction rules
The day after the lawsuit, 15 states' head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's regulations to reduce emissions of air pollutants and lead to education.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He did not mention a suit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The challenge revolved around the 1 October deadline for states to meet the 2015 ozone-level standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would delay their implementation for one year to give its department more time to study the plan and avoid `failing local solutions or obstacles to economic growth' -
Pruitt, who, before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opposer of the tightening of environmental norms.
Following the move to Washington Pruitt, the introduction of standards that were opposed to the chemical or gas and oil industry was blocked or postponed on several occasions.
An unexpected change of course on the Wednesday is a further legal defeat of Pewitt's re-entry course.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA head had exceeded his authority to postpone the Obama Administration's regulation requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, after a sharp shift in the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the States in the integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadline and then sued the activist groups and others and discussed the settlement of the case” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA at his previous post.
We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our Charter and the authority it gives us.
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point re-use his powers to defer and other powers given by law, to ensure that the rules of jcyjdphys are in a clear course and in all available information -
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 Regulations for a minimum of eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
“The change in EPA’s course, after our claims, is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the ability to cover their cities.” said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The result could cause serious respiratory problems for those who are sensitive, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the sudden change in Prüitt's course.
“It’s hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this completely logical step away from the person we are charged with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist Trump’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russia Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Lightly Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the Council of IAAF for the Reconstruction of the FLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that suspension be retained.
The extension of the suspension was granted by 166 votes, v. 21, and by TASS.
The IAAF Board ' s report stated that the VFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions established by the membership restoration board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualification of VFLA at the World Cup in London, Russian athletes were forced to act under the neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to IAAF.
The FLA was discriminated against indefinitely by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, was published that reported numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Board, see material - IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA -
Harmful defeat
As part of the 3rd tour of the Fonbeth-Prevention of Russia, among the PFL teams of Novoskowski-Chemik held a retreat against the FK-Caluga
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played with each other in a Russian cup, but this time the game was completely different.
The chemist did not give up on the opponent, but a secondly relaxation at the end of the match led to a wrong goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Kalujans with an account of 0:3, many had foretold the easy victory of their masters.
However, since the start of the meeting, the newcomers have been forced to consider and act in defence, but from the position of force.
In 1 time, the cavaliers built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very good match was held by Alexey Sirotine, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners by his actions.
Unfortunately, there was not enough effort and luck in the attack-Chemique to put the Calugi defence in the impasse and to kill the first goal of the exit.
After the break, the game began to run at the counter-courses.
Newcomers have been more active in the attack.
The warning calls to our team were defence errors, which allowed the Kalukhans to create a series of acute moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemist intercepted a territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the calujans' experience played their part -- they had a more literate, cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After the dangerous attack, Chemiste transferred the ball to a corner where the host field was taken to the gate without resistance.
Yuri Dubrovin was the author of the goal.
The Chemical meeting showed a good game, but suffered an injury.
On the front of our team is another flight, on 11 August, at 19 o'clock in Moscow, at the Torpedo stadium, called Edward Sagittarius, and the group's favorite, Centre-FK-Ararat, made up of Roman Pavluchenco, Marat Ismailov, Igor Lebedenco, Alexei Rebco.
Come back to support the Chemical.
Location and time of the meeting of newcomers - 6.30 p.m. near Magnolia - (Eastern, D.2 Corp.

According to published phone decryptions, Trump pressed Mexico to pay for the wall at the border
The Washington Post published the decryption of telephone conversations between President Donald Trump of the United States and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone conversation with President Enrique Penhay Nieta Trump of Mexico, he insisted that he cease publicly to claim that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the U.S. raced him for speaking publicly against the wall and, according to the leaking information, told him, “You can't tell this press”.
Trump started his campaign to promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
The published decryption of his first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia also revealed a heated confrontation.
Trump told Ternbull that an agreement under which the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was `stupid', `disgusting' and `stupid' and insisted that, because of an agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot, because it intended to stop the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation by telling Turnbull that \"it was the most unpleasant conversation all day.\"
The bodies of the tourists killed in Abkhazia were flown from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft, Russia, carrying the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, left at 20:15 a time in Moscow from Sochi to St. Petersburg, handed over to TASS.
At the site of the final crossing, the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Mayor, would meet together with the Deputy Minister for resorts and tourism, Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
The representatives of the MES of the Republic had previously stated that all the expenses associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia had taken over the Abkhaz Government.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of those killed in compensation in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Akhba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay for the families of the victims of the bombings to travel and reside in the Republic, but the relatives sent only credentials to the Republic to the local authorities to act in accordance with established procedures.
On 2 August, at about 16:20 a.m., two explosions of the Ministry of Defence in the village of Primorsk Gudaut district of the missile-artillery depot started to detonate the large-scale missiles and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, the storage space was set on fire, causing uncontrollable explosions in the projectiles of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian nationals, Elena Polikakov, born in 1970 and Elena Timothy, were born in 1962 and were at rest near a sero-born source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhaz citizens, were taken to the health facilities of the Republic with various degrees of gravity.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the remaining ones being issued.
Study of Russian influence on American elections will take place in a large jury
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Mueller, called a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia’s influence on the 2016 election of the U.S. President, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The convening of a large jury gives Muller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the subjects of the investigation by the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting, then another candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Wesselnica.
Müller himself had previously promised to check the details of that meeting in June 2016.
They're already being studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal capacity.
Trump Jr. had previously told us that he was waiting for Demportia Hillary Clinton to board, but that no disclosure documents had been presented and that the adoption was the end.
In early August, a number of media reports revealed that the youngest Trumpet ' s statement to meet Wesselnica was literally dictated by the Senior Trump.
In the White House, we were told that the president didn't dictate anything, he just used his authority, that any father would do.
Penza's vice-mere was delayed in the workplace
The Deputy Chief of Administration, Penza Irina Shirshin, was detained 48 hours on instructions from the Investigation Committee at his workplace, reporting RIA News.
No official communications from the law enforcement agencies on this matter have yet been received, but the UK SSC press office assured them that they would soon be followed.
At the Penza Mayor's office, there's no comment yet.
Irina Shirshine is one of five vice-heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had long been the head of management of the State Security Inspectorate in the Pennsylvania region.
Irina Shirsina is raising three minor children, noting that she was once again a mother a year ago, refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico doesn't have a launch spacer or a launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the busting of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person who went to space.
Unlike Soviet monuments, which are carried away in some countries, the monuments of Hagarty, on the contrary, look to the planet -
In 2012, a monument was erected at the United States Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the Royal Observatory was erected in the wake of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a Hagarina monument in Germany in Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Karlovy Varah, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city centre to an area in front of the local airport.
The 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga was a monument to Juryus Gagarins.
That's how the first cosmonaut's name sounds, and it looks like if he were 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists lose the Linch courts on the stage in order to call for justice
- Ford Mercury, in 1948, he drove past the audience in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and swung with a roar to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with guns set her way.
The man - in - law in his suit in a thin strip, the man - in - law, stretched his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Those sitting inside were troubled by fear.
- We need this nigger, Roger.
Get him out of the car.
The prosthetic bursts were tearing down the silence when a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on 22 July, is just staged.
But when they put a loop on the Roger's neck, almost all the spectators were really holding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when Kucluxclanovists were lynching two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“ It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them close to us; even though we know who they are, ” says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
- It's a stain on our history and it's a rock on our souls...
Brooks is a 71-year-old member of the Georgia Congress, who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the Monro people that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want to investigate, we want to conclude, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice,” he says.
- We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice
The coroner covers the body of one of the lint victims at Morse Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI reports received by Al-Bee-Se News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although suspected for decades remained at large, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two connected motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens for the first time to vote on the primers to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, Black user Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester's knife in the fight, white landowner in the way of visibility, because of the woman.
Brooks says that according to the rumours he was carrying in town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of jail and drove to Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of linemen surrounded the car.
It turns out that he organized and commanded the assassinations of Harrison, which is one of the FBI reports.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies that not only took part in the killings but also destroyed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
- It was an attempt at election rights, he says.
They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in town: if you register and vote, you'll have the same thing with you.
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been running an annual performance that reproduces the flax at Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is well illustrated, he admires the spectator and reveals the profound racism that many people would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's the most important thing.
- We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts, because they show us our own makeup, she says.
- But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've experienced
The performances of this year began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 white actors, the remaining blacks, gathered in a room and listened to a long-delayed review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He has played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but he says that the role has never become easier.
- I think I've fallen asleep because it's not the person I am - says Marbo.
- But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time.
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who are playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
The spectrum begins with Malcolm being angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, yelling and pushing him.
- I said nigma, get out of my house.
Rascono screams back.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are infuriated.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
- What's that? - Asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Do I win?
- No - says Green through laughter.
- I just don't think the whites used to say \"nigga\" -
One of the black performers laughs.
- You have to go through a hard p. -
And the same changes in energy in the room: the discomfort changes the sense of companionship.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people who have been killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascona says the word for letter n, it gets clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The spectrum ends fiercely and quickly.
Screams, shots, then silence.
A woman in her mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of the actors and plays Billy Hallide's sad song, Strange Fruit.
Her voice is interrupted by word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators wipe their tears and sweat out of their eyes.
The audience is almost equal to the number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York City, to see the vision; many live close together.
They had been suffering for almost eight hours in Georgia’s heat while Brooks was leading them to a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murders have remained a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people have been lynched, their ghosts seem to be pulling in the air.
When the last note of the song is silent, Greene invites people to come closer and examine their bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch the paint that shows blood, and the non-mobile bodies, and whisper to each other.
- They're not really dead - they're bobbing a little boy to remind themselves of it.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the ropes off their necks and wipe their tears out.
Marbo hugs Bradshaw, the man in the suit who played the main puppetclan.
Nick Rascono hugs two other actors, crying, and falls into their arms — the emotional load of the performance finally hit him.
- It's all right - one of the women whispers.
We know that your heart is good.
You had reason for this.
Later, the audience goes to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are eager to discuss the scene with the black couple they just met.
Denisa Duplinski has difficulty finding words to describe how she feels after her performance.
\"It's hard to listen to these terrible, horrible words, and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you\" she says.
- After that, I think the laziness is still happening - she's adding - only now it's called shooting the police -
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, came into common attention.
He says he's already started planning for the next year's presentation.
“The situation is encouraging because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us,” he says.
- Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who don't know their history, are doomed to repeat it --
The Court fined Nabal for violations on the \" Aggitiatory Sabbath \" .
The Simonov Court of Moscow fined Alexey Naval for 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in article 8 of article 20.2 of the RF-CoAP - Repeated breach of the order of the meeting -
Previously, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hisir Mussakaev, had completed administrative proceedings against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the opposition, Alexei Navalov, who had been held responsible under the same article as Navaliya.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitational Sabbath” held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
On seeing the agitators following the Saturday, the police considered that the organizers deliberately concealed its true identity, a public action (which requires prior request from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zidnov and Alexander Pomazouev sought to terminate administrative proceedings because of the absence of an offence and indicated that police officers had made some errors in drafting the protocol.
No delay was placed on Volkov's very advocacy Saturday, but he received an agenda requiring him to appear in the police station to report an event with his active participation.
Navalya himself received the same agenda and another associate of the opposition, Nikolai Leskin.

Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British Education Group of Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent due to the launching of a new restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their business.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fellon’s head, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, take place in addition to the 4,000 jobs that have been improved in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he planned to cut the cost by another Pound300 million ($394 million) in May in the third cost-reduction programme to try to bring back the business that had been hit by the rapid shift to digital learning methods.

Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato ' s soldier died as a result of a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as stated in NATO ' s communication.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
The explosion is the last of Afghanistan ' s bloodshed this month: on Tuesday, the mosque in Herat killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reports that an explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by means of a “man-transmitted improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded were reported to be in stable condition and to be treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
The correspondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
The United Nations reported that in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb on a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had made an attack.
On 31 May, a major explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people — the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the Taliban had been removed from power in 2001 under the leadership of the United States.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump estimates that there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting the troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its course of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The post-trial environmental protection agency annuls the decision to postpone the adoption of the air pollution law
The American Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to postpone the adoption of Obama’s age law, which requires states to limit air pollution one day after 15 states have sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step showed the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and accountability for our state partners”, said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air-purification standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the federal district of Colombia, filed an action claiming that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental decisions introduced by previous President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at a brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has raised resistance from Democrats and natural law enforcement organizations, concerned about the possible health effects of high emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that the use of ozone-containing air breathing “can worsen the function of the lungs and enhance respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures can lead to a significant reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people, so free trade could not be restricted.
The European Business comprises more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.

Mikey Garcia and Vasiliy Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive connection.
Vassili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily to hold the most exciting boxing match in weight to 147 pounds in the near future, met on Thursday for the first time.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN office rooms in Los Angeles until García, an unsuspecting champion in the lightweight of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization champion in the second half weight.
Following García's unanimous victory over the former world champion in the four weight categories, Erian Broner, on Saturday, on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched her right hand and said, \"How you doing, champion?
Good luck.\"
Lomachenko defends his belt in a connection with Miguel Marriago on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN channel.
When boxers asked for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would have been the very time.
“I used to be in half weight,\" Garcia recalled.
\"I've gone up to the council category for Broner [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm low for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to go up to the light [up to £135], and then we're going to make a fight.
It's what the painkillers want.
Let's set it up for them.\"
Lomachenko agreed.
\"Box needs this one.\"
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through PPV services, as part of the strategy that Lomachenko should pursue his debut fight in weight 135 later this year to appoint a meeting with García (37-0, 30 Nokauts) the next summer, who is also interested in striking a match between Jorge Linárez and Luc Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in light weight in the Forum arena on 23 September.
“The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it”, said Garcia, expressing later their willingness to fight on the channel that would offer better financial conditions.
“We are the principal names.
No other names will attract that interest.
As soon as they are ready
García said that he believed Lomachenko to be a “crushing boxer” and might be going to visit his Saturday meeting.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately fall asleep in García boasting and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looked \"very slow, sorry, Mikey... you've been asking for a knockout.\"
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the impact and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising in front of their own privacy.
\"This fight must take place.
No other battle is so interesting and conversational.
I am more than happy to work on it,\" Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, \"I've been waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great battle.”
On several central streets in Moscow, traffic will be blocked for the weekend.

Moreover, the Russian leader had requested action if violations were identified.
New results of tests for assessing the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the Swedish asylum-seekers ' tests, which were subject to a new age assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migarationsverket) criticized that it had failed to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Mmigrationsverket has sent 6,880 testing cases, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were estimated to be 18 years or older, while in another 25 cases the forensic agency estimated that the test was “probably 18 years or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably less than 18”.
The tests are conducted only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johann Guransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of past months.
\"We don't see a big difference with statistics over the past months, numbers are all appropriate,\" he said to the portal The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely 18 years or more of age tested”.
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person had publicly stated that 18 were due for execution this year.
The age assessment method of making X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and of giving them to dentists and X-rays has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist at the Caroline Institute Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty sooner or later than usual.
\"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the way we measure it now.
Biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to pretend we can't,' said the newspaper \"Metro.\"
However, Gueransen, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child for an adult child is wrong.
We are at the greatest risk when an individual is about 18, in which case he or she is about 10 per cent.”
Let me see if I can run for the presidency.
During his work visit to Buryayya Vladimir Putin, he said that he was ready to consider whether to run for the presidency of Russia for elections in 2018, handed over to Interfax -
The application was a response to a request made by the inhabitants of the village of Chermushka of Buryat.
During a video conference on fire management in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interviewee asked Putina to say, \"Vladimir Vladimirovich, we ask you: when the next presidential election is going to take you all to stand for this post \"
- Well, I'll think, thank you.
On 28 July, the Spokesman for the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, commented on the comments of some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by President Anton Wyno, Chief of Administration.
Peskov described these assumptions as not based on any hypothetical reasoning -
- While there's no headquarters, until the headquarters is set up, before the election campaign is far, '\" said Peskov.
- Until it's on the agenda - said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday, during a meeting with President Trump, who is moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the Democrats have moved away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“I am speaking to you today with many prayers and many meditations... today I am telling you people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you, remaining a Democratic Governor.”
The rally blew up with applause.
“This is why I will change my registration to a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
\"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently.\"
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia meeting.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42 per cent cap, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow against the Democratic Party, which is more difficult than working to make our country once again great”.
“In the light of only 15 governors and the control of the least number of state legislatures in history, the Governor Justice's statement is just another waiver of the party, which has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages”, reported the CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDeniel.
The cat-heavy caller Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to the social media
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., had a cat named Mr. Beautiful weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous on the Internet.
Mashable reports this.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat was published on Facebook, asking his master to find him, because he was clearly fed by someone earlier.

As a result, he was placed in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to exercise his excess weight.
In an interview with the U.S. radio, the American woman said that she had experienced the same experience: she took the cat home with a weight of about 10 kilos, and now it weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a picture of the animal has collected over 68,000 views.
Commentators pointed out that she could do a career in model business.
Kow commended Russia’s “cress” apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Cou, an international athleticist, commended what he described as sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that the moment is not right to allow the country again to participate in sports competitions.
Dmitry Putin, a Russian representative of the Light Athletic Federation, reported at a congress of the International Association of Slightly Feds, which had been held on the eve of the World Cup for Easy Athletics, that his country ' s exclusion from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen at the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light-Draft Federation voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) issued a report on the evidence found to support State-funded doping.
“I felt that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” said the Presidents of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations Coe.
“All the Council and Congress have enjoyed... the Russian Federation itself admits that it has experienced extreme heat and is now doing its utmost to take care of the Federation's restructuring.”
Kow said that he had also “slowed” that Russia had accepted the criteria for his recovery.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia to its rights,” said Coe.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was to separate pure athletes from the tangled system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Slightly Federations will participate, under the neutral flag, in the Light Athletic World Cup, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light-Battery Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements were yet to be met to restore Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after a report by the Council of the International Association of Slightly Feds, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still calmly doing their jobs.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of a state-of-the-art man.
Detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), journalist Vasiliy Muravitsky has been arrested for two months and handed over to the SBS.
An Internet official, Journal of Zitomir, is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and by attacking Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, which is considered a “wary policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the European migration crisis, Italy decided to have a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
Commander Borsini, the patrol ship entered Libya ' s territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants with the country ' s Navy.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control most of the country.
The opposing Cabinet and the Tokyo-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and that they intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in negotiations between Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraja.
The Italian authorities had established a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegals coming into the country from Libya had been released in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for receiving migrants had been exhausted.

Two leaders of Ukraine's assembly on athletics have been excluded from their participation in PM
Olga Earthac and Olésa Povh, specializing in short-range flight, are excluded from Ukrainian assembly on the 2017 London World Cup.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletics.
The training of the Earthquaker Sergei Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes of doping.
Powh is the 2012 Olympic bronze presenter and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European-2010 champion at an estaffeta of 4 to 100 metres, and the 2012 European-winner at an estaffeta of 4 to 400 metres.
The World Infantry Championship in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited costs on the part of European football clubs would not interfere with Neumar's world transfer record from the Spanish Barcelona to the French \"Parry Saint Germain\".
Whatever the consequences, the chain may further have implications for Parry St. Germain, a governing body for European football whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
From the Financial “Fair” rules introduced by WEFA in 2011, it appears that PJS will eventually have to show that Neumar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neumar would receive a regret that would reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
These are some of the financial aspects of Neumar's move to France.
PJV can definitely be luxuriant to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling Qatar family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platiny after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
A former French football player thought that clubs that owe enormous amounts in their quest for success were in fact betrothed and risked collapse in the event that banks or owners ceased financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abrahamic in Chelsea in 2003, buying a good-capable club, and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a global brand, has become a difficult task.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is taking over 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And even though the Platini was disgraced by the presidential office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive waste.
“The FFP seems to be alive, and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,” stated André Traverso, Associated Press, an agency in UEFA last week.
At the very least, PJW will pay the purchase of Neymar's contract at one time, and it may distribute that amount to the entire duration of its contract in order to be accountable.
Neumar has signed a five-year agreement, so that transfer value can be shown in annual reporting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first FFP sanctions wave in 2014, PJ, as well as Abu Dhabi Manchester City, heavy sanctions were imposed.
PJJ was issued a fine of 60 million euros (at that rate it was $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was required to limit the composition of its team to the League of Champions during the 2014 - 1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to intercept its financial inspections by robbing their revenue from companies associated with club owners.
Although a Qatari company would be able to offer a GSP, if funding were to exceed standard market rates, EEFA would not allow it to be the legitimate income.
That was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the funding for SPM by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been deducted.
It was reported that a portion of Neimar's earnings at PJD could have been paid by the organizational committee for the 2022 Peace Cup in Qatar.
But SPM and Qatar-2022 deny that Neumar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past SPM sanctions mean that EFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to Thursday familiar with the situation, WEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with SPM on the Neumar transfer.
They were communicating with the Associated Press on an anonymous basis because they were not authorized to discuss the SPM provision.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the PJW received over 10 million euros in circulation of Euro542.4 million.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have not been published yet.
PJD expects that Neumar's arrival will provide a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and t-shirts with a team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Undeniably angry that one of the best football players was missing, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neumar from transmitting, claiming that PJP would violate the financial “fair”.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” stated the Spanish newspaper AS, President La Le Le Le Havière Tebas, with Qatar as the final owner.
Arsen Wenger, the coach of Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares La League doubts about the financing of the club by the State.
\"It's all the implications of participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years,\" said Thursday Wenger.
\"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to observe the financial firm because the country could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and places of oath
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have drawn up the State Committee on Legislation and Statebuilding.
A week ago, deputies planned to make a direct determination of the procedure for making an oath of the law.
From the solemn oath, children under 18 years of age, as well as non-negotiable ones, should be released from the finalized text of the amendment to the draft law on the nationality of the Russian Federation (to be held at Izvez), which the Committee would consider before the second reading of the proceedings of 11 July.
The idea of taking the oath of nationality of the Russian Federation, instead of formally signing the documents, was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of Gosdoma, Vyacheslav Vladimir.
Members of the Republic of Korea amended the second reading of the bill to abolish the decision on the extradition of nationality to those subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences, such as public appeals for terrorism or public justification on the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code, art. 2 of the Criminal Code), as well as the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (art. 211, art. 4).
According to the bill, the logic of it was that, in the form of documents for citizenship, a person is under a promise to comply with Russian law - by embarking on the path of extremism, he is in violation of that promise.
In April, the bill was introduced to the State by the leaders of the Hindu factions Vladimir Vasiliev-One Russia-, Gennady Züganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov - Fair Russia- and Speaker GD Viacheslav Waldin.
On 19 May, he was received on first reading by the deputies.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Planning and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but was now reworked.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will make an oath.
Parliamentarians had previously planned to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State's coat of arms and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - a list of places where RF herb could be placed, is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of State, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, federal executive heads, etc.
Most likely, it could be the SAS.
A solemn oath will be made by officials who wish to obtain the nationality of the Russian Federation after they have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath has been sworn in, followed by an updated text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that the oath of Russia will be from the age of 18 instead of from the age of 14.
The rule remained that those who cannot make, read or sign the text of the oath will be released from oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to free himself of this procedure and other persons -
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainians who are considered to be speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the authorized body of Ukraine for that purpose.
A tentatively certified copy of the statement would have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of “others” - as it is now - will not be required if provided by an international treaty or if it is not possible - for reasons independent of the person -
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-Siker GD Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Podlanski, Paul Kraschennikov and Airat Farrahov (all - One Russia).
I think many of you know that it's unrealistic to get a certificate from Ukraine, just impossible.
Accordingly, a large number of people were awaiting a solution to their fate concerning the nationality of the RF, and they had explained before the time that Paul Kraschennikov (ER), head of the Thoughtal Committee on Hospitality and Laws.
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up their citizenship in writing and who had surrendered their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia but, for reasons beyond its control, had not ceased to be a national of another country.
Aliens are now prohibited from holding posts in the municipal service, to be admitted to employment in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Similarly, a person of dual nationality or residence of another country may not become a member of the State or of the Council of Federation.
The law is to enter into force on 1 September 2017 and necessary regulations must be prepared by that time.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the United States Starfleet - and the Society Detective -
The current iteration of history nostalgically reminds us of the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; of the frontier era in the 1990s (approximately when great master David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of the sketch State for the MTV); and of themselves -- about 2001 -- before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd turned to more serious events.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exaltation and epitome of our era, with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems an anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was an amazingly good one, not only because of the absurdistic humor (including the original story of the speaking vegetable bank that H. John Benjamin spoke).
The result is twofold: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood, thus making it impossible to get back into a joke.
Ten years later -- where adults have played adults -- have less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes reefs from scalker movies in the 1990s like \"Rooks That Calybel\" --
In one episode, the character receives Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skaters, and, uh, other things from 1991 --
Many plot moves are the same.
The friendly Coup (Shouolter), now a writer, still failed to achieve reciprocity from Kathy (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still did not separate himself from virginity.
And there's a foolish and evil conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (also known as Shawolter) is now incited by George Bush Senior (tested parody in Michael Jan Blake's performance).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the derogations from it.
It's especially funny to see the eternal young Rad, who sings Matt Dillon's song from \"Odinock\" -- a character whose former big man, Andy, now looks old.
To bring success to this franchise could have been accidental madness in the spirit of the recursive series, Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would have been its logical conclusion: \"The bitter American summer: 20 years later -- where the entire company would have been in the final scene at the premier film, \"Worship American Summer.\"
The Comrade Detective - in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the cold war memory from the Americans - - From the Blonde - or even - Blasca - with its image of the struggle between East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a television film, the Romanian police drama of the 1980s, about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin road.
The main role, which was seen in Gregor's life and idealist Josef's life, was played by Florin Pierresik Jr. and Corneliu Ulych, and their dialogues were launched in English by Chenning Tatum (an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lewitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are several visual jokes (the police spend time watching the chess match as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices by frame -- including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali, and Chloe Sevinya -- allows you to play in an interesting tone of voice --
But, Comrade Detective, it's the kind of holding true that there's an awkward propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not very much, not often.
If you were to do it in the short term, \"The Society Detective\" could do better with your satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, whenever Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, two fat men are sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
This image of Western culture, this beautiful communist star, says, is capable of doing something about it.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not right: we are doing so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Super Bowl football prize fund between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about £30 million.
Sergei Prakkin, President of the Russian Football Prime League (RPFL), reported this at a press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, RT.
He also added that so far there are few tickets to the match.
Match Spartak - - Lokomotiv - will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30 p.m.
According to TASS, \"Spartac \" is the active champion of the RF and \" Lokomov \" is the holder of the country ' s Cup.
Two young killers have cleaned a furniture price of 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old man with a furniture firm went to the police the other day.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the ceiling, causing serious damage to his production.
The warehousing of warehousing was a tool worth almost 200,000 roubles — two welds, a perforator, a hydraulics, and a winch.
The guards of order began to search for criminals and soon reached the Bashkortostan, a friend of 23 and 24 years of age.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, hacked the front door and carried out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first hit car service.
A theft case had already been brought against them, and law enforcement officers had succeeded in returning only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
Gosdep commented on Medvedev's words on RF and US relations.
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
A statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nawert, in response to the words made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, concerning the two-State relationship.
Previously, the head of the Russian Government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improved bilateral relations and had declared a full-fledged trade war on the RF.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a low level - but noted that it was necessary to seek areas for interaction -
- Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month now -
- This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia - it gives the words of the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that the sanctions amounted to trade war.
The draft law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, President Donald Trump of the United States, signed into the past.
However, he recognized that the document was unsuccessful and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior - raised - roses from amethysts and quartz
The French fashion house unit Dior - Dior Joailerie - completed the collection Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There were five new rings and three barricades on the barricades.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a roll of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds were made into glyptics (hand-to-hand stone) and respect for the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joailerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by roses who grew modeler Christian Dior in Granville and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the culprits of deteriorating relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, strongly criticized the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
\"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine,\" wrote the president on Twitter.
On the eve of the day, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
These include Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a presidential statement in which it stated that the law would prevent the United States from making good transactions and would further bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter, Sberbank.
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokokena, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary unit of Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained to RBC the intention to concentrate on other of our planned investments and projects on which we are working -
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be a better investment of time, despite the investment attractiveness of her daughter, Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the consortium's application to NorvikBank by Grigory Gusselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceryev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of Petr Porošenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, other than the WTB and the Wnesheconombank, became Sberbank.
New York City called the cause of blackout in the Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation called the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, explained what had happened.
He said that the peninsula had remained powerless due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck in the accident behind the electric transmission line resulted in the disconnection of Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
The disruptions in the electricity supply of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts removed the disturbances within hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout could be an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates of 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later declare that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakened inflation have reduced the rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and left interest rates unchanged among increasing pressures on family incomes.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with 6 versus 2 to maintain rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer Committee members favouring an increase in the rate during the month because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family income would continue while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank cautioned that increases in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control shortsighted inflation and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be higher than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge economic package launched a year ago as a result of the backlash.
From the following February, the bank would close the emergency financing plan for which it provided bank loans, although it reported that it was now expected to provide 15 billion pounds, up to £115 billion.
The report on the decision on rates stated: “According to the major MPC projections, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is soon slow, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption”.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that “some tightening of financial policy” would be required in order to halt inflation, at “slightly more” than market expectations.
At the moment, markets predict the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
But the bank emphasized that all increases would be “step-ups” and “restricted”.
Bank forecasts for increases this year and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news stories, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent unfortunate growth rate had weakened the higher expectation of increases; GDP had then increased 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The last account of the inflation bank gave little reason for the joy of the households, which had been hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: the bank said the pressure would increase before it went down.
The Bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” was successful over the next few years, but expected significant salary recovery by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also driven by the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low pound rate, which compensates for some of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent in the past August after the shocking results of the referendum on the withdrawal of the pound.
According to bank estimates, it is likely that four years will be needed to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its last decision at the rates, there was a noise about the expected rate increases, as inflation increasingly pressured households with severe pressure: three of the specialists on the committee asked for a rate increase of up to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that it was expected to fall and again compensate in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is entirely due to the low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Koreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “If we take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be again becoming even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good year’s completion.
The market looks particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as credit refinancing, often with the possibility of not having a commission, and at a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
Public health service will record 10,000 people who have given rise to the spores of HIV
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that a pre-exposing HIV ( HIV) pill, a pre-sex pill that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection among persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by a health service for an initial three-year probationary period of about 10,000 persons.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay the PREP despite its claim that it should be funded by local authorities.
This was announced on Thursday as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called him the “return moment”.
Before the complete launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, the Venerosers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposing Prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex HIV drug used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
In the event of HIV infection before having sex in the human body, sufficient amounts of certain drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and those whose partners are not aware of their HIV status with antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practice physician in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week, following an international procurement tender, signed a drug contract.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PREP by taking into account the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its acceptability and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation must complement and strengthen the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of the NAT (National AIDS Control Office), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PPT, if it is to target people in need and at risk, is an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV, through a study conducted in England by the National Health Service, will have access to a new and emerging means that can be controlled by a person without discussing it with a partner, leading to the improvement of many and many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Greene, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now the first thing that needs to be done to ensure that the test is rapidly unfolded throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we have a pilot drug, we are going to protect over 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Sharon Hodgson, the Shadow Minister of Public Health, said: “We very much welcome the commencement of the PREP test, it has been severely delayed because of months of delays and delays on the part of the Government.”
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of the transmission of this annual infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PREP.
It is now important that the test be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk on HIV and move us to stop the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution supporting the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth World Congress of Tatars (WAT) adopted a resolution that noted the importance of retaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post - positive form of the organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of all the Tatar people —
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole -
Recall that since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazanyu has been concluded for a period of 10 years.
On 11 July, the members of the Republic of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
Head of the region - the only post to be called the President -
In Russia difficulties arose in obtaining international driving rights
International driving permits (IDS) are scarce for GIBD units.
To obtain such rights, it takes several weeks to wait in line, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to leave their home country for their car or to rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP has been introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written on the national certificate, as it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are also recognized in the countries ratifying the Vienna Convention.
However, in fact, it is up to the specific police or the rolling office: some require the IDP and others have sufficient national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international rights are still granted international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in non-ratifiable countries (e.g. the U.S., Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all units of GIBD, reports Kommersant, which has conducted a study in several regions.
In Moscow, for example, in the UGIBD units, the plates are not available, and the forms are not available for four months.
You can apply to the company website, but it's been in line by mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IDP cannot obtain, for technical reasons, without going into detail, in the Samar region it is honestly said that there are no forms similar to those in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already encountered the problem, and reports are becoming increasingly common in social media:
Irina Burmistrova: “Consider why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow”
That's right, because all the HYBDD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina:
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always too far ahead, there's no talons on the spot (the button is there, but the talon can't give it).
Like a public portal, it shows that Spb's free time is up to figs.
Has anyone tried another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving permits have changed and new forms are being supplied to the Gosavto Inspection Unit.
The deficit may be linked to this, but it is not clear what changes are involved, and it has not been previously reported.
The beams are purchased by the Road Safety Special Purpose Centre (OBD CPR) of the MID of the RF and then delivered to the GIBD.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with AO-Goznak - in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms have been manufactured, 15,000 in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the GS-First Print Court to produce 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the CSN just didn't get on time to run the tender, which is why there was a deficit.
There are, however, other versions of the lack of forms: as a result of the crisis, many people have begun to drive on their own, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
Which rights are not fully understood, and therefore are re-insuranceed, and therefore there is an auspicious demand for international shorts --
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass a test to confirm their qualifications.
That was the proposal made by the Mintrans.
The international driving licence (IDP) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, August 4, in an interview with Portal - Surveyor -
No respectable international company will even resort to a bolt or hook because it risks losing its business in the territory of the EU, the US and Japan in the countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia against the Crimea.
“That is, in my deep belief, the prospects for this project are not really there,” said Petrenko.
He added that he found Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build smaller objects properly.
I know that after the Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse in Sochi.
“I think that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that are so short-sighted to join the project” the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the building of a convoy of motorized arches of the Crimea Bridge.
A major assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed on the UNHCR Bank, which is closed at a height of 45 metres from the construction site.
“Once the bridgers had prepared a rail arch for the fairway, they had reported to the project’s information centre.
In April, the head of the Mintrans, Maxim Sokolov, informed the Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, an official who had been away from work for 10 years was dismissed.
What, then, was the angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) to be possessed by the chief of Spanish official Carlos Recio?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not your immediate boss.
No more bureaucrats in the world.
The commoners seem to have been accustomed to all the shoals, the servants of the people.
Nevertheless, officials are still amazed at the kind of tax they live on.
This time, I complained from Spain.
There, a member of the archives at Valencia Carles Recio managed to stay away from work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular regrets.
It's all solid -- 50,000 euros a year.
And here's the strange times, Mr. Recio's over.
He was dismissed by the Valencian legislature.
During the investigation, it turned out that the vicious man every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to report to the electronic system.
I went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 4:00 p.m. to report back on the system that he had gone.
That's 10 years old.
It has also become known that all leisure time was spent painting comic books on the house.
Now, the members of the Valencian legislature think about how to punish Mr. Recio, the direct chief, who could not help but know how to work actively, in his workplace, his subordinate.
Judges are advised to protect themselves from presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee suggests that the powers of the presidents of the courts should be limited and that their choices should be made.
For courts of appeal and cassation, the HR Committee wishes to introduce special districts that will not be bound for administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals as part of a presidential order.
The HRM has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was commissioned by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, who the President gave after a meeting with the councillors.
During a meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016, a number of cases of court arbitraryness were discussed, as well as public control problems in the places of detention of citizens (see chap. 9 of December).
The HRC has resulted in 25 proposals which address both the independence of judges and the identification of court errors and the funding of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the presidents of the courts to improve the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully passed a contest and received the support of the judicial community, the president of the court, in the opinion of the HR must present him for appointment without having the right to refuse as the law allows.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to refer cases to judges.
To do this, experts allow, maybe a specially written computer program.
Also in the HRS, the President is of the opinion that it is not the right to pre-empt the judge ' s qualification, to initiate his disciplinary action, to decide on the determination of additional entitlements,
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves -- and to have their powers over a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation --
All presidents of the courts (from republican to regional) are now appointed for six years by the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HR Committee proposes that an appeal and cassation be initiated in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now tied to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRA states that “it is necessary to organize individual courts of appeal and cassation, not at the level of the regional judiciary, in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts,
The experts took as a basis the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have a judicial district - separate from administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guaranteeing greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using telephone law -
The HRC proposes to strengthen the people ' s jurors to deal with some categories of civil and administrative cases with their participation -
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
- It's just our suggestions - I mean, I mean, I mean, a member of the HRS, a judge of the Constitutional Court, on the resignation of Tamar Morschkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only a matter for the Human Rights Council but also for the Supreme Court (JP), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the assignment from the VC (in the context of the perpetrators, the General Prosecutor ' s Office and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the RF ensures the independence of justice, President Vyacheslav Lebedev must be until 1 September.
Living a good life: half-age and tricky design techniques have turned this little apartment into an out-of-the-space home for Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacehouse in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a sympathetic model house in Queen Anne's style, and in favour of a new design, it says that Joan didn't collect his belongings and move again.
\"Really, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,\" Joan relates.
\"I've been looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were those high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the same price on the same day.’
Since the first review of the 1,000 - square - foot apartment, a complete renovation has taken place.
It was originally an apartment with one complicated bedroom to get into the bedroom, and it had to go through the kitchen, and Joanna wanted to add storage space and half a floor to get the most out of the generous ceilings.
\"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,\" she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, a architectural design studio, Duck & Shed, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project but would be worthwhile for Joan.
The ceiling was not high enough to build two spaces one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half story where full growth would be possible.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brife.
“The work with steel structures is very complicated,” he explains.
“We had to place our rooms so that they could be on top of each other, and we didn’t have to bend.
We didn't just have to build a simple platform, we had to take out the structures so that they were at the right height and allow them to use the space from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms one above the other in the space he was looking for and a lot more interesting.
From the back of the floor, a fancy copper light window from Retrouvius opens the view of a magnificent living room below.
The gold furniture, silver accents, and Vintage lighting devices from Serge Muy set the project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding vigour, space and light.
A short corridor is lined with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel appears to be a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrors are used to store all the vessels of Joan.
To create a sense of more comfortable surroundings, the beauty of a living room can block the kitchen when it is out of use.
There's nothing new about the kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's going up the door like in a garage.
“The art of engineering was involved,” Erfan told of an armoured steel wooden and fiberglass shield door.
“It is fitted with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“Finally, the area of sex is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is based on,” says Erfan.
“The real estate trade agent, to put it, will enter into and make calculations on the basis of sex”.
Here, they were able to increase the area of the sex by using quality materials that give the surface a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help us make emotional contact with the house, ” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not hurt the strings of our hearts.”
This is evidence that the good design and the increased mileage of an apartment may, from something common, turn into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a Commission on State Cultural Policy.
The relevant regulation has been published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, refine tasks and prepare new programmes for implementation.
The head of the commission has been appointed as Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan to implement the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to enhance the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a unified cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the development of conditions for the culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has decreased to an eight-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent lower - October 2009 when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a 0.1% decline in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded a week-long deflation in 2017.
Inflation in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
Mini-economics, however, believed that the target had already been reached - at the agency's version - was 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on environmental development in the Baikal Territory, warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donsky, noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It permits logging during fire management, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored so that the process of excision would not cut out all in a row.
Donsky noted that the bill involved control by MEAs and oversight agencies.
Media: The members of the U.S.U. are in secret from command to negotiate with the Donbass militia
Regular telephone calls have been established in the Donbasa line of armed confrontation.
Fighting parties are constantly communicating with each other via mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The members of the VSU and the Donbass militia made contact on cell phones hidden from their high command.
This was reported on 4 August by Strana.ua, referring to the parties to the Donbasa military operation.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on telephone every day.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders try to reach some — tactical agreement —
Part of the result of these discussions is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists have come to know of cases in which an officer received congratulations on his birthday because of the front line, from his or her formal enemy.
The U.S.S. and DNR and L.N.F. militia sit in trenches on the line of distinction from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
MID resented the blocking of UNSB ' s attack on the RF Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy office, the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives which blocked the press statements by Sovbes of the United Nations condemning the terrorist attacks by the Russian Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria are outraged.
Russian MID reports this.
At the agency, it was recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was attacked for a third time in a month by terrorist groups - Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham - (the former Jabhat Al-Nusra - banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylak Al-Rahman -
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSC resolutions call for countering this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that it seems to be clear that the terrorist attacks - Nusra - must be a universal unequivocal and strong condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of attacks against diplomatic missions -
However, as stressed in the divisibility, “even for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine on the Security Council, alternately, vary the tone of objections, while covering the allegations of lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft press statement by the Security Council condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain to the conscience of those delegations.
“The most shocking fact is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel sense impunity” said in the MID and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council will join them”.
Vladimir Putin has argued to limit the number of unplanned business checks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, during an investment meeting in the Far East, said that the number of unplanned business checks should be reduced to 30% of the planned ones, and that the duration of the inspections should be limited to ten days.
- Non-planary checks are generally carried out without proper consultation with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office; only 2-3 per cent is agreed with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and all the rest are carried out on their own, and the President of TASS quotes.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from taking out servers and hard disks at businesses.
In addition, in the President ' s view, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will make a positive contribution to business-related cases or to the violation of the law in the business sector.” The Head of State said.
As reported, I think, due to the moratorium on planning checks, there is an increase in the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, at the order of the business ombudsman, the President of Russia, Boris Titov, was interviewed, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of scheduled checks by extra-plans (the total number of persons facing them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens ' statements (from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
Details of business checks in material - I guess - - The small business is on the other hand -
Brothers fight for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth more than $500 million, forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton football club and developer Collin de Lutis lives in Turk's palace three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him with the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court has still had a bitter divorce dispute.
With their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 items worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family started a company called Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family list includes office buildings today, parts under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
In agreement with the late father, Colin, who Paul describes as the main driving force and the dominant person, De Lutis, owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
This means that Colin's property is 316 million and that Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
- The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of his property - he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, following several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearings were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, which Paul believes was excluded from him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but blames Paul for the incompetence of managing certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he looked forward to a resolution of the dispute.
- My Italian roots make me think of my family as the top priority - he wrote.
Court expenditures are rising as snowflakes: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Kramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including Queen's counsel, Allan Myers, and the best rapists.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had managed milk bars and gastronomics, and in the early 1970s, they had bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened her first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was -- in the last grades -- and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old) --
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
Luigi often told me that she didn't want the brothers to come to court, she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, no longer belong to De Lutis; Colin says that Mark got 10 million when he got out of business and Luke is 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were - unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office -
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best other television set.
-Ferfax Media - on Friday, she contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colleen responded with a text message stating that, since the case was not yet before the court, there is nothing particularly true to say:
- I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a suit against me and to stand in court for the name of our family. - He wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin testified that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that “there is still hope for a solution to the conflict —
On Friday, this hope must have dispersed.
“ The ruling in our case will soon be handed down by the court,” wrote Colin.
The new head of Trump's office plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first one.
Politico - reports that the new head of the White House machinery plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news messages from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a calmer state.
This is what reporter Josh Dawzi reports.
At a meeting held by John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House apparatus, with the manager of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: the poor channels of information to the President.
Kelly told the staff that the information had to go through it, in paper form or through briefings, because it would be better for the President to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have failed to reconcile Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television came a few decades ago, and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could have been overcome” said February - Politico - Sam Nanberg, former electoral staff adviser.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time in Politico that, according to the six former members of the Electoral Staff, to control Trump’s habit of writing to Twitter, there was a need to monitor the constant flow of praise to him personally --
All right.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing to Twitter has ever been -- under control -- just funny.
Maybe these election staff members know something that we don't know -- for example, if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know of tweets that Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had spared him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material -- whether reliable or not -- which confirms their views.
Politico - right to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to constantly provide the President with questionable information.
Here is one example, as described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
“External and former Trump officials say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those with dangerous leaks, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone put into the President a printout of an article with GotNews.com, an Internet browser site, Charles C. Johnson, in which Katie Wells, Deputy Chief of Staff, was accused of being behind a number of leaks -- in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever taken to Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that he launched false accusations in the past and then refused them.
Trump read the article and asked staff about Welsh -
Goldmacher adds that then Chief of Staff Rains Bus and Secretary Rob Porter tried to build a system to manage and document the stream of papers that Trump receives -
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he'll be a more effective manager than the Bus, but Trump's still impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very challenging.
The Tumena Prosecutor ' s Office is dealing with the HIV disorder
The Public Prosecutor's Office challenged the decision of Tumeni, the Kalinese Garden, that had terminated criminal proceedings against a local resident who had lost a young daughter to HIV.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was a HIV disorder and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from her responsibility in connection with her father ' s reconciliation.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a Tumeni resident was initiated at para. 1 of article 109 of the Criminal Code (inaudible death) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV positive.
“The woman was not treated herself and refused treatment for her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection” explained in the Tumena District Prosecutor’s Office.
The criminal case went to Tumeni's Kalinian Paradise, which decided to terminate it on 25 July.
The father of the deceased, explaining that he did not have a wife, that she has no claims against her, that she has committed harm and that she has offered an apology.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and filed an appeal requesting that the stay of the case be reversed and that it be referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it is not possible to repair the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection, reported to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
In the view of the supervisory body, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV-dissicients would follow its example.
According to the Tumena AIDS Centre, in the Tumena region, about 12 children with HIV are now not receiving treatment due to parental rejection.
“This situation has already improved, in the year of the work of the ad hoc group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their opinion, allowing diagnostics to take drugs,” reported the AIDS Spokesman of Elena Loseva.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents by law and that, as a result, not all HIV-infected children were able to detect -- mothers prevented them from being examined, hidden, and escaped from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV-dissidents?
At the end of last year, Peterburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Health professionals and AIDS activists call these views anti-medical and their spread a serious threat.
A terrible photo session that ended in the tragedy took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Hmelnica.
A lively company of reared young people walked by the bridge over the tracks where the freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective selves on the rooftop of the wagon, and they told FACTAM, in the communication sector of the police in Khmelnica.
The guy started coming down from the bridge on the train, but because of his carelessness, he leaned behind the power line and got an instant shock.
Fortunately, the station's dispatcher became aware of this incident, which immediately called out -- the non-delivery --
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctors were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hmelnica District Clinic at the Fire Department.
Men were diagnosed with torso burns of 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit [1.2 ° C].
His condition is now assessed as stable by the doctors.
Law enforcement officials recall that extreme selves on multi-storey rooftops, transport bridges have become increasingly popular in recent times.
The police have encouraged people to be vigilant and not allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists Allowed Oceans to Exist on Ancient Venus
Oceans could exist in ancient Venus.
French scholars made this suggestion.
Experts have developed a computer model that demonstrates the process of water production on the surface of the planets by writing Science News.
It turns out that at Venus early in its history, oceans were formed with 10 per cent more water than it is now on Earth.
Earlier, the Week-Arguments wrote that according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their research concluded that the water site was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a park in San Francisco as a result of a shooting in San Francisco
Three people were wounded in San Francisco, and handed over to the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where there were a large number of visitors.
Witnesses said that several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them picked up a gun and started shooting at the people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, since they had all but eyes closed.
Another was medical treatment, after which he was released.
The third one is a minor, there is no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular site among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.

Louna rock group concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will introduce their new album, The New World of Newness, which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show that will be the most vivid of the band's concert history.
- The dual new world - the fourth album of the Russian rock group Louna.

In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group co-sponsored a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Halle with a Peace Songs programme,
It is composed of Lusine Hevorkian (vocal), Vitali Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergei Ponkratev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbourski (barabanes).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club, Faraon, on 17 October at 0 p.m.
The ticket price: 1200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the target groups on the Russian rock wall.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
On several occasions, the Group won the various nominations of Hit Order-Chert Dugin-
The Gypsy have broken the moat and returned to the “Millionaire Street”
Some of West Midland's most wealthy homeowners are again in conflict with the determined gypsies who have overcome the creeks of municipal authorities to once again occupy the field next to their homes.
The Gypsy had parked 20 houses on their wheels in a field bordering on the rich street of Solihal, with the joking title “Millionaire Street”.
With horses, infants, and many houses on their wheels, they returned after being expelled no longer than in May, and had not been prevented by a trench carved by municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical campaign found a gap in defence facilities and stopped its vehicles from crossing an area that had not been protected to leave room for the trap.
The angry inhabitants attacked the municipality of Solihal, saying that it was “inability to address the problem”.
An anonymous local resident said: \"They came here on Monday night after being driven out of Bentley Hit, where they threw stones into passersby.\"
The municipal authorities should be humbled and forced to act because they were completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were run over, and they came back again.
More gypsies arrived last night, perhaps even more today.
“The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.”
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, \"It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and this attack is going on.\"
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse pass in the meadows.
The representative of the municipality of Solihal said: “We know of an illegal camp on land near the Streetsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solihal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
The Crimea is the operation of the champagne wine plant - New World -
The Council of the Republic of Crimea - Establishment of the champagne Win-New World - decided to take action by converting it to the U.A.A.A. - Plant of the champagne Win-New World - followed by an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuchina.
100 per cent of the enterprise's shares will remain in the state of the Crimea.
The statutory capital of the equity society would be $595.5 million and would consist of 5.955 million regular shares at a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there were no funds to modernize the plant over the next three years, there would be a risk of a plant stopping.
The principal expenditure in the enterprise is about 60-70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles. Because of its institutional and legal characteristics, it is required to give 50 per cent of its revenue to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
Getting the owner's money is problematic, it's difficult to talk about attracting the loan funds of big credit organizations -- said Crimea Sergei Petelin's minglehouse last April.
Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the privatization forecast for 2017.
It was suggested that it be held and tendered.
Source - Interfax - in the hands of the Crimea, it estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise of $40 million, investment of an investor in modernization of $30 million.
The New World increased the production of sparkling wine by 2.8% from 2015 to 1.52 million bottles in 2016.
In 2017, the New World planned to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golycin as a plant producing game wine in the name of the New World.
The plant is 11 acres [11 ha] of land.
The lower - headed third - graders defeated more than 40 gravestones
The members of the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services in the Lower Town Area identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 gravestones at the cemetery in Lyskovo.
The attackers were third - grade students.
The first statement that the grave plates were damaged by unknowns was made to the Russian MID for the Lyskov district on 27 June as well.
In all, 24 people have been approached by the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code - Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places -
As a result of the investigation, the police found the suspects to be two students aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments falling, and they were encouraged to do so.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy has increased its tone vis-à-vis the ships of NGOs fleeing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owning rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities” said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minnh, in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper - Stampa -
The Minski warning took place the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship owned by a German humanitarian organization, Jugend Rette, on the suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for only a year, had rejected the substantive comments of the detailed charges filed against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
“The salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we regret very much not being able to continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now,” declares the organization in the social media.
We will be able to evaluate all the charges put forward now only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juvent, belonging to Jugend Rette, since October.
His crew was suspected of receiving entire lifeboats on board migrants, who had been sent directly to them by traffickers, and had allowed smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting, it is estimated, took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, and is confirmed in the charges published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct implies, mainly, that the Juventi-type courts will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
To date, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: “The Ware of the Children” (Maltic MOAS) and “Pro-Activa Exchange” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they did not result in any significant change or interference with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there was a Nobel Prize organization, Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan Coast Guards and to cooperate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
“ In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel,” said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
In Libya, we don't want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict.
The RF authorities have recently increased their Libyan policy markedly, and delegations from the opposing Libyan parties have taken part in the visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal Libyan settlement of the Federation of the Russian Federation and the State of Gosdum, the assistant head of the Republic of Chechnya, Lev Jongow, described — I think — the objectives of Moscow in the region and of whom it bet.
The Libyan Contact Group that you lead is hardly aware of.
Let's say the Contact Group on Ukraine knows about it.
And here is the curtain of mystery.
What are you specifically pursuing, and what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Public Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are under the supervision of the Foreign Minister Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma's MP of Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan track by the Speaker of the State of Gosdom, Vyacheslav Vladimir.
The detention of the Russian tanker-Mechanic Chebotarev in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We wondered how we could help the crew.
A military contact group, the representatives of the Gosduma, was then established, and our work was supported by the Head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadir.
How did it turn out to be that you headed it?
Since I've been working on Libya since 2008, I've been asked to take the lead in the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the liberation of seafarers from - Mechanica Chebotarev -
We have been able to reach out to all the major factions fighting against each other in the Libyan conflict - and Tripoli (which is based on a recognized UN Government headed by Faiz Saraje. - It is understood - and to Tobruk (a parliamentary measure that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalif Haftar, who is in control of the eastern areas of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Methiga (Levia's vice-premier), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
At that time, it was decided that a contact group should be established in order to make better use of those contacts.
Its mission is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with any side of the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all of us.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya?
The contact group is now composed of five persons.
Among them are people who have experience in power structures, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include the Regional Specialists, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RA.
No one is ever in Libya at all, and it is not necessary yet.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors, in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All discussions and publications are not true.
But your contact group has ex-wars coming in...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hotspots.
Or cities as closed to a certain point as Misurata (which are based on militias, which have played a role in overthrowing the Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi in 2011 and have been significantly intensified in the years to come).
We arrived in Misurata this January.
We were scared to say that the Islamists, the terrorists, are all there.
But it was important for us to assess the situation on our own, to examine the real military potential for which we are responsible, why such rumours are, what is the real role of Islamists there.
In Misurat, we met all the representatives of the units that were involved in destroying the IH in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was cut off from the fighters of Russia's banned - Islamic State - - I guess -.
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that it was they who had played a crucial role in destroying the IG in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed it to themselves.
And to what conclusion have you come?
- The Islamic State - in Libya, it wasn't Haftar that won?
That's not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on a different front, in Benghazi.
The structures under the Government in Tripoli were fighting with the IG in Sirte.
And by the way, we invited to Russia the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came, the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of Federation, Duma, MID and Rosgvardiya.
We understand that you are in all the Libyan regions and are likely to represent the sentiments of the local elites and the field commanders.
Do you think it would be possible to implement the ceasefire arrangements reached at the end of July in Paris, Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened on many occasions in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will be resumed, the parties will try to take power unanimously?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal, and it was not yet possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
Often they write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haphtar on that day was on board a Russian aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
They said to us: \"You must be very brave men who came to us today\"
But our task is to show that we do not support Haftar alone; we are engaged in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does understanding with Russian partners facilitate at the human, emotional level the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
If he knows Russian, he's very relatively.
But what he learned certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And there's more to him than that.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or even in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak Russian in a kind of fine way.
And they're pulling on Russia, and they're having some sort of nostalgia on it.
Do you believe that the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely to be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
We're interested, of course, but, as I said, we're not taking sides in this conflict, nor are we willing to arm one another to the detriment of the other.
We would like everyone to be about equal.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to contribute somehow to its withdrawal.
The constitution-making process is now progressing actively in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions and gain internal consensus.
Later, elections are to be held, as was the case at the meeting between Saraja and Haftar.
If elections are held and the legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now owns such a status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, only to escalate the conflict.
In the days of the media, it was reported that Italy, which faced African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Could Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by making use of its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s forces will exercise control over the coast and end the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with Haftar and Saraj and with Misurata and the south of the country.
In this regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a matter of ensuring that the Southerns are interdicted with the flows of migrants in far-reaching advances?
I mean, literally, we were turning back the buses that Nigerian migrants are on?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help unite the Southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Khaftar and the Southern tribes.
But to begin with, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist and a supporter of the shari ' ath in the country.
How radical does he feel?
Would this not be an obstacle to building relationships with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion on him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, the opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting the terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us from going there.
And we've got them all mixed up, and we're starting to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobuck.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosnefti has concluded a cooperation agreement with Libya's State Oil Company, NOC.
The director of NOC Mustafa Sunalla, with whom the head of Rosnephti Igor Sechin had made a deal, was himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft,
What will Russia do to her?
I suppose I'll resell.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to resign the contracts concluded at Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, the pattern of oil in exchange for services --
I don't know what the scheme will be, but I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are in fact engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to make an agreement with each other so that they can order themselves, and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and removing terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former Soviet Union?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Committee for State Security, who said that to date no country from Russia or other countries in the former USSR is there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya).
And from what States then are these militants?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
The question will then be raised differently.
How many Libyan Islamists in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans, not more than 5% of them.
The rest are coming.
Is Moscow able to negotiate in kind the case of Paris?
There are plans like this.
We are actively engaged in negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have announced their willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits must be made, and it is hoped that the time and place of negotiations will be clear.
In the Czech Museum, the beneficiaries raised money on a expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matzol, who has DCP, brain hydrocephalia and complete blindness, will receive a specialized escape route on 5 August.
Sascha, Minister of Culture, Oxana Kosarev of Moscow, and Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum, provided a useful presentation.
The training money was collected during the charity Marathon - Don't get up to do good - which took place in Melchizedek on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov.
On the eve of a marathon at the museum, I received a letter from Sashi, who lives in Manushkino village of Chekhov, saying: “I don’t see the eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter.
- I'd really like to get a ride to make my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit
And here is Sasina’s dream come true.
The museum will be followed by the “Concert Post-Scriptum” - a prominent pioneer, Russian artisan Alexander Hindin, who will perform porpoises from popular classics.
During the charity Marathon in Melihow, the choir of the Great David Desert called Ilya Drozdikhina workshop, students of the P.I. Chaikovsky and Russian Academy of Gnesini, Artists of the Melchizedek Theatre - Chekhov Study -
The visitors were auctioned, a book fair and charitable gift sales with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melichovo Reserve Museum took the initiative to make Chekhov Day 15 July a single day of charity in all of Podmozkovya Museum.
A 30-year-old Olewska district resident at the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the young people who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported by FACTAM, in the communications department of the Gitomir district police.
After that, the man entered a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building in which a man had used a rubber bullet-shooting device to wound one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, and his life was not threatened.
Police officers and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the gunmen had fled by then.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same date, on 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet firing device that's sent to the expert.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 of the Criminal Code have been initiated for this purpose.
Detainees are at risk of imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kyiv, an attack was fired at fire on 28 July at Lukiyanovska in the area of Tatar Street on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's sentence for reports of suicide of Conrad Roy
Massachussets was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michel Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of his term on a grid and a further five years of probation.
Carter in June was found guilty of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearings on Thursday: “My family is killed in grief.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers claimed that she and Roy had suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and cream blouse, listened to her sentence standing, shook her hands, and gave up her eyes.
- She killed Conrad Roy by her actions.
- She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility, she said.
- She showed no repentance -
But counsel Carter said it was a tragic case she deeply regrets --
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his view, her age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant effect on her actions.
The prosecutor read the statements made by Roy Lynn Roy’s mother, who says: “No day went by when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do it -- I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that remains with us forever -- he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was promptly pursued by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunts of his children.
\"To see a man who's always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of his life.\"
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the responsibility of a person ' s advice to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with HMS symptoms, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been pushed into suicide by Carter's message.
\"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, slaughter yourself with a knife I don't know many ways\" -- she wrote in several reports sent two weeks before he died when he and his family rested.
Just a few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, \"You have to do this, Conrad, and you have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy.\"
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention by means of Roy's death, and prevented her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The lawyers' views on this were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British roommate in Italy two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published in Los Angeles Times -- a particular opinion that stated: \"Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not jail --
Eugeny Boschev: “I let Langford go like a tall - flying bird ”
One of the best basketball players in the WTB Single League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNISS.
The withdrawal of American defence counsel, Izvedia, was commented by President UNISS Evgeny Bozhev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, and he told Eugeni Bozhev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I thought I'd go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he earned a different relationship.
He played UNISS three seasons and showed a high level in each match, with all 100 per cent.
So I let him go like a tall bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Casana Club for three years, winning a single League-2015/16 silver.
In the period-2016/17, he received the award of the most effective player in the Euroliga season.
He scored 21.75 points on average for a match.
The result was the second year since the award was established.
Langford, who won the 2014 award, was the second player in Euroliga’s history who won the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China, Shenzhen, informing Eurohops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be second to July by the Euroliga Star, which goes to the Chinese champion.
Previously, an ex-Centre-Panatinicosa-Jannis Bourusis moved to the CBA in China.
A sunburner from Podmoskovya was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigea
Adigei rescuers have, today, evacuated from the mountainous region of the Republic by helicopter, a submersible tourist with the strongest sunburns.
The man was resting at the Pist house, which was 16,000 feet [16,000 m] high.
The 27-year-old tourist received increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The leader of the tour group approached the rescuers, who told them that the man had been burned on the march.
Audi will have to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW stated that it would be proposed to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believed that “there were more intelligent routes than driving restrictions” with reference to European cities, including Munich, where BMW was located, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called it a rebuttal.
European automobile manufacturers have actively promoted diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with the carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost to the automakers of the installation of equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust also goes up, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for the cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, the Chancellor's government, Angela Merkel, has also accused them of following powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the \"Folxwagen\" error, which has hidden the use of so-called \"disruption devices\" that during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted in order to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, be turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
A former head of the Thermodynamics Unit in the Audio Engine Development Group was arrested last month in Germany.
Former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and is therefore vulnerable to extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to bypass European emission regulations and expanded the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionately high share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrahan a coffee visitor paid off with false money
The police were informed by the employee of the bank's office that they had been found in the cash transfer from the generalty, a suspicious bill of 5,000 roubles.
A study at the Criminal and Expert Centre revealed that it was false.
According to the UMVD of Russia in the Astrahan region, one of the people at the cafe who purchased the shaurma paid the bill.
It should be noted that the cashier was not equipped with a buyer's authentication device.
Police officers are currently establishing individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of an notoriously forged CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services encourages residents of the Astrahan region to be careful in financial transactions; it is recommended that trade officials install instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found the Ajad planet on which even iron can float
For the first time considering the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics was much surprised by its temperature, which was able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that water molecules are so hot with the star’s light that infrared radiation is released.
The Hubble telescope has sealed the glowing water molecules on this gas giant, which makes the atmosphere of the planet in an infrared range at high temperatures.
WASP-121b refers to so-called Hot Juppets - gas giants, comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but 10 times closer to the parent star.
This year only 1.3 Earth-days are on the exoplanet, and its gas cover is almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provance.
It has become a symbol of Provance and South France, but it is now feared that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse because of dry weather and insect borne diseases, which has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Schees, an expert from the Provance Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provance has indeed been threatened because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: there has been much less rain in spring and especially in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there's also little cicadas that populate on leaves with insects carrying microbacteria; in very dry weather, they're getting very much --
There's a lot on the map.
The lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much used in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Sches says: “We have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent very long ears with large numbers of large flowers.
So we have fewer parts that contain air oil . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Decisions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slow evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and producing more drought-resistant varieties.

Two-fold Hockey World Cup, Ambassador Zimney University-2019, Alexander Semin, met on the eve of the start-up hockey players and distributed autographs to the painkillers.
The meeting was held in the Winter University-2019 tent during the thematic week of the hockey game.
Any traveler could walk on horseback in an artificial ice field.
In addition, estaffets, victorines and games played with souvenir products were organized, and the division of aerobics had to be blurred.
Fifty students attended the event.
Aleksandr Semin advised the boys how much more they could do in sports fields and stressed that the most important thing in early learning was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
- There's a site in Krasnoyarsk like the Zimney University tent-2019 where the starting athletes can direct questions to team coaches - said the champion.
Note that promoting student sports and healthy lifestyles among Ukrainians is assisted by Ambassador Zimney University-2019.
The tent of the University will operate throughout the summer season until 25 September, reporting the Zimney University--2019 directive to the press.
In Gosdepa, the words of Medvedev were commented on.
The official representative of the United States Department of State, Heather Navert, commented on the need to find areas for interaction with Russia at a briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitria Medvedev.
She said that such areas should be found to - improve bilateral interaction -
A successful example of this cooperation was the Armistice Agreement for Syria.
We are two nuclear super-Powers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other” said a diplomat.
In doing so, Navert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
- If Russia said that, of course she has the right to say it, but I can't say anything more on this subject.
Previously, U.S. President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of the Medvedev Government stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the U.S. sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the U.S. Sable was the Clean Trump.
The missing bodbilder in Podmosk found someone else giving a lost memory
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July, under very picuous circumstances: he left the car for the living room to go to the toilet.
Seven days later, he was unsuccessfully sought after by acquaintances and locals.
I'm looking for Shamil on a stranger's daughter in Ramensk.
He was completely naked in his host's bathroom.
A Dagestan athlete couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
To establish his identity helped to declare his missing.
The outside medical staff recorded partial memory loss and brain injury at Hanmetov, reports the Mash.
Maybe the athletes are waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, the keys to which he was also stolen.
The oil revenues of July exceeded the projected 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenues resulting from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
Exceeding, the agency explains, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per rouble compared with the average monthly value of June used for the evaluation, as well as the excess of actual gas production and the volume of petroleum exports of projected levels.
Refraining the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from a monthly assessment in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019, +40.2 billion roubles is projected in August 2017, as reported by the Minfina.
Thus, the total amount allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Every working day during the period indicated, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases on organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an equal basis during the business day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to Federal Treasury accounts in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodoza usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa, a state of organized crime, corrupt officials, or ongoing war drug dealers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: taking children with them to an office where they had already dropped a grenade in 2009 or left them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board that hangs in a room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names of each column - no evidence is necessary, no suspicions or internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of holding a whole list of candidates from the Government or cartels, making it dangerous to cover Mexico's chaos.
The violence does not spread any further, and there has been an increasing number of journalists among the dead: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder-Riodose Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is very acute, although his presence everywhere is a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger, with the inscription Justice on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in their 30 ’ s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have T-shirts depicting his smile, face in his glasses, or his firm panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug and organized crime killings every year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Journalists at Riodoza insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, even though they are killed in grief, though it is much more dangerous around us now.
Without information about the killers, without justice, there is little benefit in talking about the security of the meetings, Ibarra says.
- It's really stupid to spend time at this seminar - he says.
- Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone -
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoza in the capital of the state of Kuliacana.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was taken out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means “Twelve River -
The shooter left his car and crashed her nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's got a wife and two grown children left.
Listeners usually go around Kuliacan quickly.
But almost everything is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and released to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
We shall not say that one or more people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two - story mausoleum drug kings, who are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of peace is just when one of the cartels is taking control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of the Riodos, was crushed by his feeling of guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was released in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions who fights with Guzman's sons.
The publication could be angered by the sons; the people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were brought to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security, after another newspaper had been captured that had written about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroest and sold his 50 dollar shares with five colleagues in 2003.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to deal with journalism without affecting the subject of drugs,” said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for being bold and honest, and for selling and advertising profits.
Journalists liked to be able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about something no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after her founding, Riodose received a prestigious award from Maria Moores Cabot for his reporting work in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in investigating the Mexican drug trade, wherever it went.
He frankly admitted he was scared.
\"I want to live on,\" he said at the CPJ Award.
A drug trade in Sinaloa -- that way of life -- he said last October in an interview with Rompepiento TV.
- You have to do things that lie on you both as a journalist - or you're a fool.
I don't want to be asked, \"What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?
Staff at Riodoza misses Valdez, a joker who fought like a truck in a port, a friend, generous hugging, and advice, a teacher who knew how to pack up alive.
They relied on the order they had set.
He should've worn his hat all the time.
He was supposed to go to El Guyabo, a bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking him, \"Have he been destroyed by love of the only order?\"
His death caused them to doubt how best to do their job and stay alive.
- They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, children, their legal business, and the underground airfields for the transportation of drugs.
- Those things were behind the damn thing,' said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was high levels of self-censorship and self-preservation.
I have to believe my instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says editor Riodose - Andrés Villareal, is that - the proboscis can be deceived... - and then what happened to Javier -
The old rules, he says and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoza staff met for a security training, cellular phones appeared to be banned, a few days earlier it became known that spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were being used in Mexico to track journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen are hidden in the shades of a tree from the 104 degree Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the state government to guard the Riodoza office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacana.
Some journalists have asked whether these police officers include 50 per cent of the police in the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under de facto control of drug trafficking gangs.
The nearest issue, Riodoza, had three main themes.
It's the murder in Sinaloa of a brother of a former champion on Julio Cesar Chávez box.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in their hometown of the Governor.
And there was group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
It wasn't officially announced who was abducted or how it happened, so care must have been exercised when it was time to write about what everyone in town knew: it was a favorite restaurant at the same time as drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, there have been loud allegations of corruption against several PRIs governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son - El Chapo - Guzman had slipped from the raid of the military.
Some months ago, readers would have sought Valdez column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
- The 46-year-old Villareal, called El Flacco, says:
- Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken -
The Valdès Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and bandits protesting against the murder of journalists, because staff members have become what they have never thought they would become: activists who speak on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez picked up several posters and went to the next morning to demonstrate to the local prosecutor ' s office about another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoakán in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, to organize protests, and to write \"SOS Press\" on pavements and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the demand for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdés Ramírez, she accused the authorities of spying journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give her any more tasks in publicizing the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdès has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalist, he wrote that reporters are not simply killing drug gangs; they are doing so on orders from politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were perpetrated by police and government officials.
- In Mexico, you're dying because they want to shut you up - - Ramírez says.
Of course, murder is a protection against people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masías six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
She found a note on her body allegedly written from the face of the Zetas cartel: \"I am here because of my articles \"
Computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close down like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after killing her correspondent, Miroslav Brich, in March.
Others continue to hold, like - El Maniana - from Nuevo Laredo following the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through an editorial in the first page, entitled “What You Want From Us —
Some journalists have left their home states or a country at all.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they continue to see danger on the streets.
And they are sometimes killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's afraid to write about the drug trade.
- Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a journalist - he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was ready for the press, Riodos publishers sat on the pavement next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at once.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to unfold, as promised in a series of letters from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the pavement, they put on the Riodos website via their mobile phone
The next day, the first page should have been changed.
Not too soon, the sirens were raised, another gunfire in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw whether the security police were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of their deceased newspaper founder, whose middle finger was placed on the view of Sinaloa, the Riodos staff, continued his business.
“How can you think of closing down,” said Bohorkes, “if the day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report...
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though he's a nightmare.
The researchers told us that the first remains of an incredible substance from a rhino discovered by a Canadian miner remained so well known that the experts called it “Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his bluish skin was red and brown and to say that he had, in some way, a dark past.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-preserved of the findings in the history and one of the best copies of dinosaurs in the world”.
This fossil is a recently discovered copy of a Nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a small period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune has shocked researchers, who call him “really wonderful”.
This herbivore is the most highly preserved fossil of this species in all history, according to National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Millenium Mine at Sancor, near Fort McMurray, North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the rock's environment and decided to look more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tirrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done to locate an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be shown.
“It is only a little to be caught and it can almost be believed that he is sleeping,” told leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tirrellian Paleontology Museum, where the establishment is demonstrated.
“He will enter science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite its shelling and the fact that it resembled a walking tank, it seemed to have been exposed to considerable danger from the fleshy dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, covered with powerful armor, used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also enjoyed by many of the animals of our day.
This would allow him to blend in more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting his enemies, the experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This phenomenon, at 110 million years of age, was widely publicized in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of Mark Mitchell's museum lab, one of the group's members, who spent over 7,000 hours digging it.
The amazing preservation made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape and shape of the jerseys and pansy plates on his body.
They discovered a protective coloring method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protection paint is well distributed, the discovery was unexpected because the Borealopelta dinosaur is far larger than the currently living animals with protective colors.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by fleshy dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern coloring animals — such as deer, zebras, or armoured animals — are much smaller and more readily available, indicating that the Nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur panicked shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melodic period were,” said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Chase dinosaur also indicates that its skin should have been red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the remaining contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and with its back to the bottom of the ocean.
During those times, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the south of Florida, and rivers and oceans are more likely to have spread far further into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly marked by the fact that it is completely covered by the remaining wheat skin, while being completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
\"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did back then, in the Early Malt.
You don't have to resort to imagination to re-establish it, you just have to get a little bit caught, and you can almost believe that it's sleeping.\"
The period of time is an era when giant tetrapods, fleshy dinosaurs on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, there could have been some of his formidable ancestors hunting the tyreofora.
These include an acrocantosaur, a 38 - foot - long monster (11.5 m) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea and mummified in the ile after death.
The substance was found by Sean Fank when he was working at Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum's staff, it's the world's most well-preserved tyreophore, along with skin and panic, and it's a target, from the face to the thigh.
On average, they reached about 18 feet (5 m) in length and weighed up to £3,000 (1,300 kg).
Two 20-year-old shoulder spikes were their distinctive sign.
Researchers believe that this herbivore has been hard - pressed because it is now Canada, until the spilled river has taken it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his shell with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossils of this particular copy have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover the burly pancake plates along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in the National Geographic magazine article, the degree of preservation is “rarely like winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the burly pancake plates that encapsulate the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is pulled along the side, five fingers on it are turned upside down.
I can count the Czechs on his pillow.”
Michaela Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, who had formerly led Georgia and then Odessa in Ukraine, came to Poland.
He did so without having documentation to prove his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported to the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on its YouTube channel and his presentation.
Saakashvili attended an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since a politician does not speak Polish, although he has tried to start speaking that language, he has had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as to Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his citizenship, an opportunistic politician had learned while in the United States.
He was the only one who managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents, so far not known.
Earlier, the former Governor of the Odessa region, Michael Saakashvili, stated that his signature on a questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been falsified.
The politician emphasized that he had not completed any questionnaires.
The period of investigation in the Weinziher and Olkhovik case is extended until January.
The pre-trial investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova-Evgeny Olkhovika group and the head of the powerhouse-T Plus-Borys Weinziher group has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering extending the accused ' s house arrest.
The representative of the UK reported at the meeting on the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to extract and carry out an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several RF actors,” the investigator said.
He added that suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olhovik, as well as the former leader of the ZA-Complex Energy Systems, Michael Slobodin, who, until 5 September, was head of the Wimpelk Company, was handing over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for the establishment of the best possible tariffs on heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of a favourable business environment.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, phased into Syktivkar and arrested for two months, Slobdin fled the investigation and was declared federally wanted.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the depths of his soul.
Just one day after arriving in New York on a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching a tape Facebook on the phone.
She hit the post of someone from high school.
It said: \"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he still lies in the middle of the street.\"
Noting that no one else of her tape had posted this information, the job was to close the Facebook and open the Twitter.
She had a lot of traffic on the user with @TheePharaah @theePharaah.
A real-time rapist from Greater St. Louis was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be four hours away.
\"It's a savage,\" Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't new to her and her circle.
She postponed her phone, and later in the evening, I went back to the tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed that he was Brown's father, the top poster, saying: “The police officer from Ferguson has just killed my unarmed son!”
She's seen a live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protestors with a snooping dog.
On another video, another cop, she said, \"I'm gonna kill all of you... animals!\"
\"It's not a normal situation,\" in his own memories, Ferrell said.
\"It's not murder like the ones we're used to and can call typical.
At that point, I felt a chill.
I was angry and cried.\"
She took the ticket back and left home the next day.
When she landed at 11 o'clock, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years was the subject of a new documentary entitled \"Who Are the Streets?\" that will appear on the screen on August 11.
It is the story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience in terms of people living in and out of the community, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a dress in a flower dress and wreath, they recalled a conversation they had had spent so many times before this morning, “of blacks' experience and their situation”.
She remembers saying, \"Do you remember what I told you about black people fighting for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now, because the policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.\"
\"I couldn't help it,\" Ferrell said later.
\"What's happening today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She must know, see and be raised.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of experience of black people and their situation, and what we must do to become free to break free.
Even if I could provide her with an environment in which she herself would not face apparent racism, she was no different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have given her a bad favour if I had stopped her from doing it.\"
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop they made at South Florissant Road, on a site located across the road from a police station that looked like a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the outcome of the failure of Officer Durren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
In his mind, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitarian Students, representatives of national minorities, and was concerned with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
\"I haven't had experience as a organizer.
It came on its own.\"
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Saba's Folayan, one of her fellows, at an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, \"just wanted to document\" the events.
Ferrell asked the question, \"Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play on?\"
This skepticism has been practiced by many people, often white, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and persistence.
In a recent interview by Folayan, “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently”.
Folayan had already joined his contestant Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism in the death penalty.
His participation aroused his sympathy for Ferrell and the six other local residents with whom the Chi Streets Project team had been in touch over the years since Brown's assassination.
\"There's no one talking for us or for us in this documentary, we're talking for ourselves,\" said Davis.
“This was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it is the way I will be represented myself.”
Although the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience -- in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the savior leader, but about how the community unites,” as Folayan said, it was the most open-minded of the film participants.
As a result, The Whose Street? shows suddenly the personal aspects of Ferrel's life, for example, how she fell in love and married to her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrell, laughing at the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I realized that when you do this kind of work and you humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created the #BlackLivesMutter tag on social media after the murder of Trevon Martin's black teenager in 2012 -- identify themselves as homosexuals.
“Red homosexual women in positions of leadership support this movement,” says Ferrell. “All because we fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black-headed homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan accepted this claim, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a multitude of homosexual black women”.
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the man who awakened the energy,” she said.
“ On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it came first, because when ”
You can feel its energy through the screen.\"
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long since gone to film cameras, but complex racial connections between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell's another two and a half years will be on probation for road closure during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home simply, \"Bardak\".
She's still holding on to the story she learned when she came out on Ferguson Street three years ago.
We have to fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for the bite of U.S. players
El Salvador's assembly footballists Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have received long-standing disqualifications for unsportsing behaviour.
During the fourth-final match of the Golden Cup of Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCAF), Salvadorans bited American players.
Henry Romero's attorney was the first one.
El Salvador bit the attacker Josie Altidora, and then pinched him by his chest.
Seren, a half-protector, then bit the U.S. attorney Omar González when an angle in its penal square was delivered.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.

Origin: Artists create DNA portraits by Chelsea Manning
In the middle of the Freedman Hall in New York City, the faces of the people -- white, black and brown -- are hanging from a ceiling on a wire.
The 30 portraits were created by Heather Duy-Harborg, an artist from the cheek of the tentacles and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Davenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is 35 years old for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, held on 2 August, is entitled “The Rise of the Similarity —
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harbor, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident whose sentence was reduced by Barack Obama just three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed the DNA software from Manning and used it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who could have had a genome like this, Dewey Harbor created a deep, though difficult, manifestation of the manifest on not only the plasticity of the DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the alien determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but since his teens had openly said that he considered himself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the spying, computer fraud and theft act.
Her photos in prison were not available, so there was only one picture of her: a grainy black and white herring, where Manning, in a platinum wig's tint, was clearly awkward, was driving her car, and she was associated with the photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harbor completed its 2012 project, Vision of Non-Scientifics
In it, an artist made portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence of the type of carcasses and chewing cutting, removing DNA from it, and creating images of what those people might look like.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
- They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article - she explained to Dewey Hagborg at the preliminary screening of a new press exhibit.
At that time Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked her if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became correspondence friends, sharing several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book called Comics - Sufficient Images - illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who described how President Chelsea’s punishment would be reduced in the future and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
What Obama really decided to do was release Manning just a few days after the book went out proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about the exhibition that opens right now when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government and comes up with new ways of inciting Twitter's hostility, which he's intended to mitigate.
When Dewey Harbor was asked about the coincidence of all of this over time, she said, \"There's nothing wrong with that.\"
In a statement by an artist written on the gallery wall, Manning's enormous signature below (with a heart instead of an over-i- in her name) calls for an end to the “automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientificly sophisticated artist), Dewey Harbor was hoping to show us how we were all remarkably similar, at least in our biological structure.
I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is -- said Dewey Harbor; its 2007 video \"Low Memories\" is also displayed here.
- The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here.
The last part of the exhibition in one room is a comic book novel mentioned above.
On it, Manning, in the King Kong style, appears over the U.S. Correctional Cazar building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
If they kill your speech, they will win. It is written there.
♪ So don't ever shut up ♪
- It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me. - Says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
- I still have ant on my skin when I'm talking about it.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as the visionary is depicted in comics - but when it comes, she will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, by her own genomic simulators, gathered as if by a crowd of protesters.
This was also done deliberately, as was the case with all of us at the exhibition up to a height of (5 - 2, growth of Manning), where genetic haplogroups were painted as a pencil.
- I'd rather hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people.
- I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release.
Professor at North-West University and staff member at Oxford University are looking for police for murder
The police report that there is a nationwide raid on a professor at North-West University and an Oxford University staff member who are wanted as suspects because of the death of a man in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook Court ' s records, warrants were issued on Monday for presumptive murder without the right to bail for forty-year-old Wyndem Latham and fifty-five-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-year-old Cornell Durano died after being wounded multiple times.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, it is stated that the body was found on 27 July.
A police call was made and they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Durano was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives investigate death from knife wounds, viewing it as murder, while police are searching for two suspects.
Latham has served as associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of the North-West since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice-President of the University for Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit the campuses of the North-West University.
“It is now a criminal case that the authorized persons investigate and the North-West University cooperates with the investigation,” said Kabbaj.
Warren works as Senior Finance Officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to give up.
The Chief of Communications of the Chicago Police, Anthony Gullemi, said that he strongly advised suspects to surrender.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” said Gullem.
According to Gullelmi, the local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Gullem, the police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gullemi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself took place on 27 July.
He said that the video camera data confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship,” said Gullem.
The Grand Plaza manual issued a message to the lodgers stating: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible domestic accidents”.
Russian vice-premier Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map soon”
Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions set out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA) would be met soon.
A certain phase in compliance was completed, and RUSAD was given the right to plan and carry out tests in conjunction with UKAD (antidoping agency of the United Kingdom).
The WADA road map was updated respectively - Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the restoration of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA ' s work and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
- Everything has been announced. It will be done.
He added the results to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and VADA as soon as possible.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian andidoping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the VADA investigation conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that the content of the Russian sport was controlled by the State.
On this issue, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no State programmes, and we won't recognize what wasn't.
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rsport-Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems that had occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
Unquestionably, no one is going to accept the report - Smirnov added.
VADA suspended ROSADA from doping in November 2015, following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of the WAD, Olive Niggly, stated that RUSADA was moving in the right direction to resume his work.
A 79-storey Dubai firefighter
The big fire that took place in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, full of water, transmits to Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters were able to cope with all the fires by 4 p.m. local time (300 msec).
The local authorities reported no injuries as a result of the incident.
During the fighting, the streets adjacent to the sky were closed.
The reasons for this are still unknown.
Previously, it was reported that Dubai was the site of The Torch's 79-storey residential skyscraper, one of the highest buildings in the world.
All tenants were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable shape of the Bouzian fan shock: non-covering pants
Scandal leading reality show - House-2 - Olga Bouzov struck the spectators of Europe Plus Live by rabbit dancing.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly appeared singer duet with Nastya Kudri performed the song, \"We'll be hot.\"
Both girls went out on stage in the provocation brücks, sewed in such a way that the underwear of the singer was in sight.
Buzova and Kudry inscriptions were made on the pants.
Previously, it was reported that changes in the appearance of Bouzov had been made to comment on a specialist in a Moscow clinic for plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg recognized the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, the news service - Radio 4 - reported this with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the Crimea and destabilization situation in eastern Ukraine.
Stoltenberg, however, assured that dialogue with Russia was nonetheless possible and that any of the participants would benefit from further escalation.
Previously, on Thursday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerously low level and charged the United States Congress with that.
Yekaterinburg Metro is developing a new way of paying for it
In October, a ride in the Ekaterinburg Metro will be possible to pay for a bank card, the director of the U.A.I.-Sec, Paul Vedernikov, in an interview with the Regional Gazette -
Our goal is to introduce the same system of subway travel to the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, the guests of the municipality, to take advantage of the subway with their bank cards without obtaining tokens or standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Herrett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction of his startup staff in the area of electronic commerce, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, undisclosed.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust in the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, managing a company in San Francisco with 75 members of Madison Red, an electronic hair-care trade.
She therefore turned to others for help.
A new type of startup is now emerging in the area of staff management, which helps companies to understand how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, which is designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make express inquiries, to address specific teams and demographic groups, to offer anonymous and hotlines to employees for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass top management and direct to the directive.
\"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?\" says Jim Barnett, founder and president of the Greent launch from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
She told me that she had come to a better understanding of what her staff think and feel in the three years of \"Glint\".
In addition to express questions and questionnaires from certain teams, the product offers a warm map to the company and illustrates which units have more complaints and which managers have low approvals, allowing them to understand why.
Companies are sometimes aware that they need to control the workplace, or they will become another “Uber” who is involved in a scandal when a former employee post on a blog describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed frustration have been punished.
For startups like \"Glint\" it's a desire to control the situation -- an opportunity for profit-making.
The Internet portal “Let's talk about pay”, dedicated financial technology, global governance, regulation and compliance could cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The “Convercent” of Denver, Colorado, which assists companies in preventing and detecting misconduct, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the decline in Uber’s reputation.
Almost 600 clients have Convercent, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Ober has recently appeared to clients.
Like Glent, Convercent allows companies to send personal interviews of staff, collect confidential real-time responses and view warm maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allow staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the board.
“The Court of Public Opinion seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company does not deal well with the employees or does not behave ethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may have costly customer boycotts, staff outflows, and lawsuits, it told Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for more than a year to make sure that the staff were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a main office email, file an official complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, director of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be quickly detected and dealt with.
“I can get closer to a coherent, comprehensive understanding of the situation of the staff,” said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings with the staff”.
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm, had failed due to ethical misconduct as a result of Del Enron.
But only when “social networks have received widespread distribution ” did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus on the network.
“There is more to begin using technology to control ethics than people have used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee to use their products.
It was a business model and an opportunity that received the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million from firms such as Sapfire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, making the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing amount of research has shown that today's staff expect more of their jobs than they used to do.
Markets with heavy competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, are only a necessary minimum.
Staff want to feel like they're being accepted and appreciated and that they're spending their time with a good mission.
“When people are happy to work for a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful”, says Nina Mackuin, Vice President for Global Benefits and Staff Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors generate income when companies do well from their portfolio; they do well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace cultural experts, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But it's useless until the company's trustees take action.
Indeed, if a company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that there is change.
And if the changes don't come fast enough, or if they don't come at all, there can be disappointment, and the staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rath, president of the Kotter International management firm, who had to see companies make a mistake relying too heavily on data collection.
\"So if you don't go to the end, the staff will say, \"Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I be equal?\"
According to Herrett, Madison Red, who now conducts monthly interviews, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after receiving feedback from staff who are dissatisfied with decision-making speed and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has gained new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long run, it will be better able to retain these knowledge in an industry known for its high turnover.
\"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people,\" said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is discovered at the Red Army Avenue.
Cardinal measures were taken in Barnaul to address the cause of asphalt failures in the Red Army Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly inflated carriageway (crossing with the Youth Street) decided to open -
Recall that the collapsing of a small section of the road near tramways was due to the fact that the land was located in the area of an unexploded network.
According to the Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Economics, Improvement, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmat, a detailed survey will be conducted for a detailed survey and the elimination of the obstacles to the collapse.
Depending on the outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the re-establishment and concreteization of unmanned communications will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
Team Bruins has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11 o'clock; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, are being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields to a team on campus.
Some of them pulled their t-shirts over their backs, sparkling their sweat after the first heavy day of the sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these minutes of idleness are a mid-day break.
After three hours of training, players will go back to the dorms to prepare for their final exams, and the next morning they will return to Wasserman's football center at 6:30 p.m.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, team coach Bruins Jim Mora said: “The next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat tube.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the pressure on players, has actually extended their working day - at least until the end of the Friday exams.
So the start of the first three trainings for the California University team in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit in an already dense schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings a day was greater than one training days, and Bruins moves the camp to start nearly a week compared to last year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in six Sea seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions until 20 August inclusive before starting formal preparation for the first game in the season against the Texas University team A&M in September.
The sea said it supported the change in rules from the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it had created another point in the players' tight schedule.
“For three or four days we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test,” said the Sea.
\"And they just got over it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is an easy task, as its fields are in direct sight with an adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have moved the protective network beyond the gate.
Bruins players have to occupy a hotel starting this weekend, but the Sea allows that once rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” said Mora.
\"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger of anyone taking a room, sitting there and recording the training on the video.
If you have a video recording of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in parking room number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to be too worried about that.
We have a plan.\"
All victims of the Petersburg attack are released from hospitals
All victims were released from hospitals during the St. Petersburg attack in April.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-Governor Anne Mitianina.
According to the figures at the end of July, there were three people in the station, handing over the “TV centre”
Recall the explosion in St. Petersburg Metro last April 3rd.
The bomb exploded suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
The terrorist attack killed 15 people as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of the day before Rosprodnadzor recommended that the Peterburg metropolitan area should revise its transport safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is increasing the fact-chatting in the fight against fairy news
Facebook will frequently send texts suspected of being an independent expert and will show their findings under original positions, stating on Thursday the world ' s largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called feic news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize the potential hoaxes, send them to check and possibly show them the results of the initial post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy news, which many believed has influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also an active debate in Europe after French voters have been misled by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they expressed support for a plan to fine social networks if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in the German language, Facebook reported testing a new Cheking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which reports are contested by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgments about what they are reading and sharing,” wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook News Manager in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the article-based function -- and work on other news changes to address the issue of fairy news.
Create an novel comic: One lock in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video Squeez, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it was a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But for 700 years from his cozy place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he watched a gruesome story around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a scrap hair and a propensity to historical documents, to a novel comic.
- I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago - he says with encouragement.
- You feel it in person when you hold that letter in your hand -
- The building in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells of families living in Scottie; each story is illustrated by a young British painter, Isaac Lenkevic, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote the Dead Man's Tooths and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the depth of his soul.
- I could have stretched my fingerprint at the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked as an anchor - he tells me.
- That's his fingerprint.
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days fire was lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives...
For a person who has such a passion for old paper, to receive support from the National Foundation and the English Art Council, and to live in the castle for four months — to be honest, I had a little bit of a meal there — it seems too good to be true.
Rods studied the New - Victorian Castle for days, went through the archives, and looked at numerous treasures of name and old things - such as the gyres on walls or bottles, which had been in ruins for centuries.
He was walking around the park and at the ruins of an old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank wines, and sat down to write;
The history of Scottie Castle is not well studied, because the National Fund was granted full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the officers were just starting to deal with the archive, which he describes as the kind of thing that the aristocratics of the century had fallen to the herd.
Days, letters from the British Empire, maps of who owns what: \"You think land disputes are boring,\" Rhodes says, \"but here two families fought for this shore.
It's just like that, guys.
In some stories, the castle collection has become a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the Labor hero, a newly built castle comes out of the newly built castle to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
- There's information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called the Knight Families of Kent and Sassex-- says Rhodes.
The Crusades started in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected.
The other stories are closely related to the story of the castle -- for example, the Priest -- which tells of a priest-eze whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or, Contrabandist, of 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funerals, struck the tomb with stones (this was discovered several years later when the grave was dug).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes, all of whom were inhabited by Scottie: “Gentlemen seemed to have been a perfect sting, were always in debt, and spent money on what they couldn’t afford.
Through generations, Darrell's men solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of cute guys who are capable of caring for their large-scale heirs --
At the end of their work, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in Finnish soil, where he wrote a graphic novel about the Elamyaki, where at the beginning of the twentieth century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew back into the forest.
But Scottie remains a special place for him.
- It was sad for me to leave, - he says.
- I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to life again.
Fifteen of the largest banks choose - Russia -
The conflict in the Russian Banks Association (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselchosbank, Binbank and FK-Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, no less than 80 per cent of the market will fall out of the ARB.
But it's not just a way out -- all the banks that have declared the break-up with the ARB are engaged in negotiations with another social organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Association of Regional Banks -- Russia -- which is led by a prominent politician, Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Committee of the State on the Financial Market, recognized, at the end of the last session and the most effective leader of the Dummy Committee and deputy on the number of bills that have been prepared.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a discussion at the Council of the Federation, when new bills were considered by the Interregional Banking Council, including new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
Then Garegin Tossunian, President of the ARB, stated that, according to the association, the bill was adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus sought to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticisms of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which had, indeed, been objected to by the representative of the CBS: many of the heads of the banks that had been fined out, in particular, had entered the governing bodies of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and was a visible reason for the top fifteen banks, in opposition to the ARB policy, to begin preparing for the association - Russia - noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB will be low-level, and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is in fact not taking place”
We're going to have better coverts.
What's the end of this?
We will answer the first question that arises immediately in or near the least possible crash or conflict in the banking sector: it is not likely that investors will be in danger of the security of the banking system.
Chairs Russia-Anatoly Axakov, known for being sensitive to all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the guidance provided by the CB is present at the annual events of the association, and all relevant legislative initiatives by the regulator are carried out through the peer-reviews-regionals-
In terms of personnel and organization, there are apparently no special shocks.
Without a doubt, the ARB falls into a difficult financial and management situation once such a powerful and influential participant has been deprived of such contributions and lobbying.
However, there is considerable potential for this senior agency, which was established in 1991, to continue to improve banking legislation and the general monetary policy.
It cannot be said that the Russia Association, with its open arms, is prepared to receive on any condition new members, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova, may wish too much - which, on 21 July, at a briefing at the Parliamentary Gazette News Centre, stated that - literally the next day, representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider building the potential of our association - Russia -
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, both parties ' proposals are being examined, and an extraordinary meeting of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September in an international banking forum.
We'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Axakov, while stressing that, behind the chair, did not hold, called a possible new head of an updated association, Russia-Georgi Luntowski, who left his post in September as Vice-President of the Central Bank, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakov, who is now on his way to the Crimea, plans to suspend his leave and attend an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Association, Russia, on one day, where the agenda for an extraordinary meeting - Russia - is scheduled to be considered -
The entry of petrol vehicles into major Russian cities will not be limited
The deputy head of the Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline vehicles into the major Russian cities would not yet be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually upgrade the environmental classroom.
And there's a concept that's going to go straight to zero emissions.
I think technically we're not ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same thing at the level of slogans: let's prohibit it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Can we close the whole city?
- After 20 years - I don't know if it's gonna happen - - brings the Prime word to the Minister.
Previously, the newspaper Izvedia reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arcade Dvorković had been entrusted with the task of examining the proposals for the possibility of the domination of electric transport submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO Kamaz Sergey Kogoginim.
Among the proposals, according to the paper, is the use of vehicles with DANs in major cities and resorts.
Washington, D.C., is changing the rules for the receipt of engravings.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted to change the rules for the receipt of funceries.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republic party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so in the face of a change in the US’s ability to hand out grunctures to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process would benefit English-owned candidates, have the money to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
We have failed to think that 2017 can no longer be worse, and a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots has come out.
Mda.
Sex robots are in the middle of the focus now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharky, the well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffild and the founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot eyes, the shape of the suckers, and the type of fingernails.
“People are giggling about, but firms are sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see them a lot more soon,” said Charkey at the presentation of a new report.
Modern sex puppets evolved from their inflatable assembly of silonic leather robots, warm to the touch, and with almost human cues driven by artificial intelligence.
Users can also build — their own handshake — by choosing from the color of their eyes and the shape of their suckers to the shape and color of their fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have a personality — compared to what Stepford Women would have shown to be very progressive — is even more disturbing.
Modern sex glasses have turned into silonic leather robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to tune in quality jobs that they find attractive -- for example, shyness.
There are other Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by the Truth Companion, which are supplied with an already programmed individual, such as the Cold Farra, which gives the impression of a suspense, and Dikaya Wendy has a bold character.
♪ Roxxy Gold has a character that's good for you ♪
So she loves what you love, she doesn't love things you don't love, and so on.
She's been changing her mood for a day, like a real man!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be in a mood -
In the emergence of sex robots, there is much concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all concern is the subordinate image of the woman, the rape association, which causes possession of the cold.
On the Internet, Truth Companion, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator only for men.
- If a woman (sic!) has a vibrator, why men can't have Roxxy, they say on the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subjection as an opportunistic supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the backs of consumer culture.
But what comes down to us from the periphery can be very instructive for the species of the age in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these complicated sex robots came at a time when women's rights around the world are at stake when the White House has a president who boasts of what's coming to women.
The most frightening thing about the TV series, the Servant's story, is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies, and the eyes, which is how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve this physical similarity for real women (only with porn ratio) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to be human beings to copy human body movements.
But it's your character that robots don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could ruin the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as we say in 2017, the maids.
The L.A. citizen Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been in support of Ukraine's gathering since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball champion, the final part of which will begin on 31 August.
This was reported in an interview with BeBasket's General Manager, Blue-Yellow, andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
“ This situation will make it possible for our young players to develop,” he said.
I recall that, with the direct participation of Jeter, Ukraine's gathering took on a record sixth place in Eurobasket 2013, and for the first time came to the basketball World Cup, where yellow blue failed to overcome the grouping phase, while a U.S. citizen scored 15.4 points on average, 3 sets and 5 broadcasts.
Jeter has ceased to speak in favour of Ukraine since he left the post of Chief coach of our National Team, American Mike Fratello, who resigned from the post in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their team tournaments on the Earth, the promised one.
Evgeny Murzin's trustees will have five units in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tour, our men's team carried out two check-ups in which the Dutch and Belarusians gave in.
The big Trump wave?
I think it's pretty smart to paint Mita Romney.
In Trump's age, the fact was that the political disputes that had polarized the American electorate had broken some families at a micro-level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers perched columns on how to deal with horrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're gonna pop.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who's been on knives with Republicans in his family for a long time, came to New York City this week.
She reminded me that association in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
At Trump in the White House, all she knew, including her Republican brother, with whom she had argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely came on the same side.
It's certainly good for dinner, but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed his force into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule may move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we have in mind the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be hit by his weekends.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump normalizes — the rightmost Republicans — who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly be a model of common sense.
I've caught myself feeling very bored today by Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness -- with a dog on the rooftop of a car and a 14 per cent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) -- compared to Trump, and both seem like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids at a carousel in Central Park -- the largest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-vowel paintings on the central drum, the glamorous clowns and the animals, which, being driven out, look at their back horribly, are extremely repulsive, and the buzzing music is strange.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointing: the species are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are coming too hard to cause awe, and the reality of the city is not following a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I found out that the Suiss-cottage district is not really a Swiss shale (the thematic pub - ye Old Swiss Cottage - not on account) but a large round intersection in North London.
And the Central Park carousel is still an unusual, magical place where a child is two years old, a child eleven years old, and two women can spend forty hours perfectly.
If I could set up a carousing score, I'd put in a five, but fortunately no one asked me to do that.
And in a department store this week, I was asked to conduct a terminal card, to evaluate my experience of buying a scale of between one and five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus an option to accompany a 15-per-cent tea score is to order from the rack.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowed down, but it is also necessary to have a personal bearing on a situation that does not imply it.
A poor salesman in a department store smiled smugly while I was tired of valuing my credit card experience to her at five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison because of his visit to the doctor the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital to treat wrist cuts, which the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of falling into the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office for an initial conviction for an unintentional murder.
He killed Stephencampe in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times in it through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend for a night thief hiding from him in the toilet.
The Public Prosecutor's Office declared its intention to lodge another protest, this time against Pretoria's six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
The period of Pretoria can be increased by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The NTV journalist suspected of being beaten has been signed for non-removal
Capital law enforcement officers chose a restraining measure in the form of a signature of non-removal for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Slorageev during a live flight from Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of the Russian Federation, Irene Volk.
In an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Federal Republic of Korea - against a 32-year-old man who struck on the face of a television correspondent in the Central Park of Culture and Restaurance by the name of Gorky, the suspect has chosen a preventive measure in the form of a signature of non-exmission and proper conduct - Volk has been specified.
The representative of the Ministry added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for non-compliance with the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct flight to WAT Day, a non-cut man came to the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with VAT.
According to Sprout, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to apprehend the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for their illegal tent parking
According to the BBC television channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had put tents in an unsettled location, including two Bulgarian citizens, were arrested in Citonia.
They were released on the same day, while the result is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC television channel that Bulgarian citizens had then been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their control of the free camping and have already awarded serious fines to all who will be caught while parked in a place other than that intended.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, a fine may be imposed by the court.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused the US Vice President of the Time - Cold War rhetoric -
Statements made during the European tour of the Vice-President of the United States, Michael Pence, were criticized by the Russian MID.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is turning more and more deeply to the primitive ideological cold-war images — which are completely out of reality —” is said in a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
Thus, in MlD, they reacted to the words of Pens of the O - Russian threat - and to attempts to force the border crossings he had said in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed out the destructiveness of the choice — or of the West, or of Russia — and the invisibility of the thesis of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that had violated international law by applying force to the exclusion of Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to cease the shelfing of Russia and its foreign policy line, which has always been based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive way, taking into account the interests of each other” is stated in a statement by the Russian MID.
Feldscher was injured in an accident with an ambulance in Podmozkovje.
The accident occurred in the sub-assembly Stupino, as a result of the collision with the Caret - Help Speed - the paramedic was damaged.
Today about 08:10 msk a Mitsubishi car collided with a ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow.
“As a result of the crash, the ambulance was turned over” - the TASS was reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service in Moscow.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers work, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son into the building and turned it into a cellophan bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the Police Division of the Division received a report from a local resident that it had found a package with a baby in an unbuilt private home.
Law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly took the child to a medical facility reported to the Odessa Head of the National Police.
Medical authorities have determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the pupa.
Priority operational activities have established the identity of a pregnant woman, a 36-year-old local woman.
It is also found that the woman has three children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been considered by the law enforcement officers and had not been specifically taken into account.
The police are now establishing the circumstances and reasons that have led the woman to the action, and a procedural decision will be taken thereafter.
Now the infant is under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nicolaeva, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage dump.
Gregory Leps: “I fight, though 55 - not 30 -
One of the most successful artists of the Russian estrangement, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary in the coming Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer spoke to the narrator - Vestius -
I remember what your militia said -
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gainor, is a patron's cock, a powerful salute over Moscow-river.
You must have pretended like you wanted to spend your next five years.
Are there any plans?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, spent three times with the gastroles all over the country, giving 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I'm now, let's say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks will not be fooled.
The way I sang in my 30s gets harder.
Nevertheless, I'm in battle, I don't want to stop.
And with new people, I think I'm at a different level.
You and the new album are writing with them, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and we're going to send it to a studio in Los Angeles.
It's called, \"You're so serious, by the same-named song that was written with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
Let's do this later when we put a clip on it.
And let's introduce the album in November -- to a series of my Moscow-Crocus City Halle's anniversary concerts --
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, has put his hand in your new plate.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your gastrol composition as well?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects).
But for long work in Russia, they put in excessive conditions, mildly speaking.
It was €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malchishev.
It is better to feed your own souls.
At times, I want to fight them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fédor Dossumov is highly regarded at the international level.
Western music magazines invite him to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, after listening to his game, said that a new generation of guitarists had come, with another performing technique,
Your album's in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't still come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers that deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't go to America.
I told you I was studying.
The more you associate with real professionals, the more you get.
We're not stupid enough, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music over the past 70 years have never faced the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They were seeking to sound as good as possible.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now somehow Great Britain refused me entry for ten years.
But I'm going to apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy so that I can be allowed to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And as of August, you're having a concert in Monaco that's not booked, it's an air service, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo -- I've been there once.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets are already sold out.
We're going to go to the Randew Lyma Vaikule on July 20th at Jurmal?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a beautiful singer and a beautiful woman who is able to give herself and a beautiful eye and even a whisper.
After the show and the party concerts, as far as I know, you want to address Vladimir Vysotsky's work once.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 Highlands songs about the same time he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
Accommodating me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'm going to try and get Aleksandr Yakovlevic Rosenbaum to join the album.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenko's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write his album down?
Boris Borisovic is a great man and great musician.
I would cross with him several times and ask him if I could sing a song or something?
He said: \"Grigory, I write songs to make them do.\"
Please, try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write an album like this.
As long as I don't have a task like this, but in the future, a year or two from now, if Boris Borissovic doesn't mind, I might be going to do a project like that.
If you don't focus completely on your production center.
I suppose until you have realized his potential, you have signed contracts with all the artists who are interested in you?
There are a number of performers that I'd like to have under my wing, but they're separate, separate people.
You understand Sergei Lazarev?
The ear is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And at my center now there are Alexander Panayotov, who I led at the Goloce.
He and I have a contract and work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
He will be truly sorry if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick him up with a repertoire, take off the clips.
Hope for a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, cry poets, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still prove our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money they put in them.
Although I'd be pleased if any of them made business progress and paid me the interest we agreed to do the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anyone's oxygen.
Let everybody work, break, prove how I've proven it.
If you're asked to do a gastrol tour for Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee you're going to enter the country?
I'm still being invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my own country, a Russianman, who supposedly flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If they say tomorrow that we have to go to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll go.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret the fact that we have this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, Annie Lobode, and Artem Loick...
In Ukraine, a mass of gifted people, and I sincerely regret that they are now unable to throw their talent fully into a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some kind of Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as the Glorious of Vakarchuk, and to make a joint concert with him.
But I think at this point it's unlikely...
Andrea Ochlopkova was thrown from the launch site
As has been known, the Director of Technology for the East Andrei Ohlopkov space launch at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HKNPC) of Hrunichev.
He had previously de facto been involved in the construction of the East Spacefield, but, owing to disagreement with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Operations Centre (CECI), he had been transferred to the Moscow Philes plant, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ochlopkov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function is scattered across the CENI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director for Technological Development of CENCY, Andrey Ochlopka, has gone to work in the Hrunichev HKNPC, which was originally to tell the top managers of several space industry enterprises as well as a government apparatus.
- He's been working in a new post for a few weeks now, and he's got interviewees working in the industry.
No operational comment could be received by CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information I see is officially confirmed in the HKNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said to the enterprise. Andrey Ochlopkov's task of providing a launch minimum for the first launch at the East launch site was fully accomplished.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to CECI in 2013 with a space force behind his shoulders, in particular on Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, at the North-North side, occupied the post of the first deputy commander in the rank of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his delivery, the regional merchants received state-of-laws rebuffs, but failed to comply with the obligations undertaken to clean up the parts of the rockets in the Arhangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technological development responsibilities of the CECI have been extended to various projects, but the main one has been the construction of a spaceship in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview -- I mean, to say clearly that the situation in East -- was critical as early as October 2013 --
The fact is that a strategic error was made in the planning: the completion of the construction and the launch of the first launch of the Soyuz 2.1 was scheduled for the same date, the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the construction had been decided six months earlier and had been postponed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, they had to do a trick: the CENI experts began to install technology equipment at unbuilt sites in parallel.
Andrey Ohlopov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed, and the change that took place (instead of December 2015-Soys- only flew on April 28, 2016), the idea proved true, says the source -- I guess -- at the launch site: \"We would still not have carried out any of the voyages from the East, but would have worked on the construction \"
Vice-Premier Dmitri Rogozin, who is in charge of space building, used to call Andrey Ochlopkov his space-based Susanin, but he almost always asked for information about the design.
Mr. Ohlopnikov was remembered and he was straight: in an interview, I mean, he proposed to deprive the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spesstru) of the status of the only East Executive and to work directly with subcontractors: \"Why do we have to put all the eggs in one Spectrous basket \" .
This idea has found support in the Government.
Since 2017, CECI has assumed the responsibilities of the contractor-general to complete the start-up and technical work at the fourth quarter of the launch team.
According to this data, it is understandable that Mr. Ochlopkov’s transition to a new place of work has led him to argue with CENI’s leadership on how to complete the construction of the structures and complexes of the cosmromone, as well as how to work with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be best for everyone,” says one of the top managers in the East.
The government official, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals, and finding an equivalent replacement would not be an easy task.
According to the data, it is understood that this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the spacefield will be abolished and its functions will be scattered within CECI units.
Music schools are going to have two occupations.
In the future, pupils in children’s music schools will be able to receive two classes at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education, St. Golebenco, this can be re-assigned to students of recurring disciplines, while the question of the remainder of the class in the second class can be resolved with special grants, says RIA News -
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow for the acquisition of two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict existing educational legislation” said Golubenco.
Last Friday, at a Sunday talk, Vladimir Putin, with his students at the Children's Centre, Sirius, a student, Maria Andreeva, reported that she had to pay for recurring items in the second specialty at CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was studying the violin and piano class and she had awards in both directions.
The Head of State acknowledged its relevance and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was arrested by a 17-year-old man in a wall on the skyscraper.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russianman named Cyril N. was arrested and reported to El Universal on a portal on a wall on the roof of a tall building.
The incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
A young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and took himself to one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
We've got a young man on the rooftop.
The staff of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him to the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It reveals whether a young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, a video from a young person who is on the rise has become popular on the Network.
Users called the young man, the spider.
According to the media, these experiments are a hobby.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the HLC.
Red meat and chocolate are assumed to be a nightmare for your digestive tract.
However, recent research suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meats and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300000 in the United Kingdom, leads to the infirmity of the stomach, chronic or bleeding, the loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
In order to alleviate symptoms, patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University have found that the main amino acid protein triptophanes contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestines.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestines keep the harmful microbes from entering the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in the intestine have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine, and the development of cell populations that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophans were held in the diet of mice, the more immune cells they had--
He suggested that the same thing would work for humans: the combination of L. reuteri and a rich tryptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
The postpog Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, who was studying a variety of more tolerant immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line but was held separately did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiomes of the intestines of mice, which are communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which usually live in the intestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestines of the mice were sequenced and six types of bacteria were found present in mice that have immune cells but do not have mice that do not have them.
The mice that were grown in a sterile environment that had no good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell got L. reuteri, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of fluids - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of triptophan processing known as indol-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also dropped by two.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have as much more tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our stomach and gut tract.
It is not known whether the L. reuteri side products of tryptophan help humans to develop cells as well as mice, but those with inflammatory bowel diseases have been diagnosed with defects in tryptophan genes.
She says: “The development of these cells may be something that we need to strengthen, since these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan, with L. reuteri, can potentially lead to growth of their population . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to José Mourinu, Manchester United hired a \"guynia\" in Nemania Matic
Manchester United hired a \"gnia\" in Nemany Matic, believes José Mourino after debuting in a match against Sampdori on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's 40 million pound player began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last United Pre-session match before the WEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday and was impressed as a semi-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira burst forward when they were grateful.
However, since Matic did not participate in the Chelsea pre-session tour of Asia, he was seriously under-prepared for the game and held a total of 45 minutes, which Mourino said would require further elaboration prior to the start of the Prime League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, um, the genius of how he thinks, he thinks football,” said Morinyu.
\"We'll help him prepare sooner than later.\"
Like Mother, his new associates, Victor Lindeloff and Romela Luka, began playing at the Aviva stage when Morinyu began to form his main composition by the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Morinyu wanted to hire three more players, but he said that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
\"I'll be happy even more if they get me four out of four, but they're already very good for me.\"
The former leaders of the social democrats of Lithuania are coaxing them into a ruling coalition.
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-premiers Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former seima Speaker from the social Democrats of Cheslovas Jurchenas, have appealed to one party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported in the “Parliament newspaper”, because of friction with the partners of the Alliance of peasants and Greens, the Social Democratic Party initiated a debate on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
Here are three senior experienced companions who addressed an open letter to one party, which states, inter alia: “Surely, the disappointment of the party's election results, but the coalition with the peasants, has created for us, not a very easy one, but an environment for the further realization of the social justice goals that, on our initiative, are provided for in the Government's programme, and for the preservation of the political dominance of the left-wing centre over the right-wing parties.”
According to the party's former leaders, in the debate, the expression of emotion-based opinion has been adopted without specific arguments -
The authors fear that their party ' s thoughtless actions may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
An invalid, Anton Mamayev, was fined
Mosgorsoud has reduced the punishment of an invalid man with a staff member, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, a judge had been released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirezev Court.
Mosgorsoud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he had set up a robbery and abduction of a motorler from a former special forces fighter.
Mosgorsoud’s decision reduced the execution of Anton Mamaev to £200,000.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and therefore must be criminally prosecuted” explained “originally, press secretary of Mosgorsoud Ulian Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied section 64 of the Criminal Code, which provides that penalties may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamayev Vasiliy Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would give rise to a change in the seriousness of the action and to a change of sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself claimed that he was not satisfied with the Mosgorsoud decision.
I am disappointed by the decision of the court.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify it, to fight further for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out appeals of conviction at the Mosgorsoud Court of Cassation and Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he said.
Recall that the 28-year-old Muscivist Anton Mamaev, who suffered from spinal muscle atrophy, became criminal figureier last autumn.
The disabled person claims he bought a motorler from people who know about 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, motorlers, among whom the former warden of the Special Forces, claimed that the disabled and his assistant Vasili Serostanov had taken possession of them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirezev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasiliy Serostanov to three years in the colony, while Antona Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in the general regime colony (para. 2 of article 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the General Prosecutor ' s Office for Human Rights, President Tatian Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIzo by a decision of the same Timirezev Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed against the decision of first instance in Moshorsoud.
ONF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The Outcome - Action Forum - The Sorbian People ' s Front (ONF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, reported - India - source to ONF, and confirmed the head of the Aleksai Anisimov community.
As a result of the French forum, he said, they planned to report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy for addressing them.
Interviewers - Izvez - in the ONF point out that the report of the Head of State will contain a “deeper analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to data available, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
Its exact date has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is built upon by the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key activities of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostow-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryaya Ulaan Oude.
On the basis of the suggestions that have been made and will be made at these events, we will formulate systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as told by an interlocutor to ONF.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Olga Timofeev Movement, who heads the Committee of the State for the Environment and Protection of the Environment, reported that the French would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the Forum of Action, ONF, are likely to be combined.
Over the course of a year, we grew up as a powerful team of environmental experts, saw legislative gaps, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition, \"Frontals \" are also reporting on work on UNFF priority projects, and reported on \"Ivediam-Olga Timothyev \" .
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the Forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To keep these issues from falling off the agenda, she added Olga Timofeev.
The head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Colladine, noted that while raising environmental issues, ONF is working towards the Presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President,” said the Newsmen, Andrei Colladine.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded to date, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to address not only their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, but also the addition of an expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the direct line with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the collapsing in the Balachia (really closed) and about coal dust at the port of Nashoka (also drafted a bill banning open coal transport in settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofeev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is the question of further law enforcement as well as of the position of civil society.
The Head of Charity - Ecology for All - Leonid Bochin.
A member of the HRS, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia - Sergey Tsiplenkov, in conversation with the Ives, stressed that the responsible approach of society and business, one legislative effort, is essential to a successful solution to environmental problems.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, Sergey Ciplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the tendency that infringement of environmental legislation was a cost-effective solution to the business.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and a car in his arm.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed by a microchip to open the door of his home, enter the office, and even drive the car with a simple twist of his hand.
Stephen Northham, a 30-year-old, used a tiny chip between his thumbs and his thumbs and now, through his firm, BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives by accounting for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, a consulting anesthetist from Queen's at Winchester, to ensure that the application procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip used by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces locks in homes and cars with a chip compatible with a £300 chip per lock.
One child's married father has already put technology in his home and in his car, BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Requisit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to TIME records, the White House decision last month to drive a South Lawn Marine helicopter to an event dedicated to American industrial production cost 24,000 taxpayers.
The White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as \"Marine One\", when the President is on board, became a central element of the White House event of 17 July, with American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House top officials examined technology products from all 50 states.
A helicopter in Connecticut was fired next to a boat in the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squad of Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), the Department responsible for helicopter control, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you knew that it was an extraordinary, widely publicized event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his superior, the first deputy aviation officer of the Marine Corps, on the e-mail of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second return flight crew would be required in accordance with work hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event and the unit's security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it is not clear whether the second crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether an event was contrary to that regulation.
“We asked, among other things, if this law was violated by Hatch, and we were told that it was not”, wrote the Commander.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” replied the deputy chief.
White House was declared an official event, and the Hatch Act did not extend to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made an effort to advance the health reform that had been under way in the Senate at the time, and he praised the attempts to regulate government orders.
The use of aircraft known as \"Marine One\" and \"Air Force One\" for political purposes is hardly new.
Presidents are required to use them for their journeys.
But it's not unusual to ask them to be alone in the interests of photography.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential flight ran rearward during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled at the display of ‘Affluent in America’,’ which featured products from 50 states made by U.S. workers from American materials,” said White House Spokesman Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transport of President United States to the White House with accuracy to an inch.
When Trump was in early July at the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the “Affluent in America” event was read off by the crew for the required training flights per month.
The aircraft also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the “non-resident support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a South Lawn helicopter demonstration.
HMX-1 does not account for the presidential flight budget, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the 2017 fiscal year rate of the Ministry of Defence, the VH-3D reimbursement rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that the time of aircraft in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield based at the Kuantiko Marine Infantry Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“It is completely wrong to calculate the value of taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement,” says Walters.
“These applicable rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriation”.
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spyser spoke in defense of the helicopter for the event.
\"The idea is to demonstrate this week's stuff that's done in America,\" he said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly on.
It is therefore certainly appropriate to draw that attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump was involved with the helicopter by looking around the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely in the driver's seat in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump approached the representatives of Sikorsky by searching with the press for his own fleet of products from the company.
\"I know \"Sikorsky,\" said the President. \"I have three.\"
Moscow will issue grants for the emergency offices of urban hospitals
Each year, grants - Savings of life - will be allocated to resuscitations and intensive treatment units in the capital clinics.
Funds will be directed to encourage doctors and medical nurses.
Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobianin visited the City Clinical Hospital named Judun.
During the examination of the clinic, he gave a thank-you letter to Traumatologist orthode Victor Procco, led by a complex juvenile foot rehabilitation operation.
Sergei Sobianin also described the decision to allocate grants to the resuscitations and intensive care units of urban clinics each year.
Funds will be channelled to encourage doctors and medical nurses.
According to the capital city chief, the Judah Clinic is now one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colombian Rural Hospital.
More than 1,000 patients are currently assigned to the medical facility ' s offices.
In addition to resuscitation and static there are day offices.
There are 2,800 hospital staff.
The total area occupied by a medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the health institution became a part of the pilot project for short-term accommodation (SPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used in the process of surgical intervention, which will significantly shorten the rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation at the station, they spend only a few hours.
In just the first half of this year, 36,000 patients were given permanent medical care at the Judah Clinic.
Medical staff in the clinic performed 15800 operations of various degrees of difficulty.
NBW reported no buyers of Ukrainian-child-Sberbank
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBU) was informed of the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian daughter Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to the NBU press official.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017 a package of documents from the Belarusian and Cyprusan national Victor Prokokeni for the harmonization of the indirect (through Paritytbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares has been withdrawn.
Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBS were not received - this is noted in the communication.

On 28 July, it was reported that Nazbank of Ukraine had denied the Russian businessmen Saidu Guceriavu and Grigory Gusselnikov in acquiring the Ukrainian child Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the fact that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents for verification to meet the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported on the sale of her Ukrainian daughter, Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company last March.
The consortium's major shareholder was Said Guceriev, son of the Russian businessman Michael Guceryev.
Penalties against daughters, five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were forbidden to withdraw their capital from the country in favour of their mother ' s organizations.

SF released Lakeov from the chairmanship of the head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Council of the Federation endorsed and dismissed the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Ozerov.
He remains a senator from the Habarov region.
An application requesting his release from the position of the Lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the necessity of rotation and by his desire to change the rhythm of life.

Electricity is cheap for both residents and Buretha Commodities
For decades, the efforts of the Soviet and the post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric power consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the cost of low-pressure electricity is reduced for industrial beneficiaries.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation to amend the Regulations on the Whole Market of Electrical Energy and Power and the consolidated forecast balance between the production and supply of electrical energy (power) within the framework of the Russian Federation ' s Single Energy System for entities of the Russian Federation - (17.07.2017) - has established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Burya.
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for Buryat manufacturers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades the leaders of the Republic have been striking the thresholds of Moscow's cabinets in a futile attempt to balance the region in tariffs with a nearby Irkutsk region, with a cascade of hydroelectric power stations in Angar, which comes from Baikal, the main watershed area for which Burya is.
It wasn't until this year that the move started.
In March, electricity tariffs for the Republic ' s population were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the addition of Buryatia, by decision of the Federal Government, to the list of wholesale market price zones, for which features of wholesale and retail markets are set in motion by industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 roubles for a kilowatt/hour.
But no one dares to call at least the approximate date of new tariff movements towards the low point for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Cattle Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's bison for his long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
The GMB Scottish office reported that the issue of future investment at the Tolkros site was silent.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces, among other products, the Hobbs liver and Rich Tea.
Pladi, owner of McVitie's, reports that he has invested over five million pounds in the site over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the site's operation, the employees and representatives of the union will “know them first”.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish GMB requested McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffey, stated: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot be clear from the general head of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolkross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in Greater Glasgow; this is a major pillar of decent work in the Territory of High Unemployment and Social Deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brekzit, an increase in subsistence and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish in the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The manager of the Tolkrosian facility received a letter from the GMB Scottish office just yesterday, and the company will respond immediately because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the trade union”.

Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be connected to the issue of gas transfers to the Eastern Petroleum Company (GNHC), but the Gazpromu guidelines, like Rosnefti, would not be given.
Thus, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the controversy.
The Head of State drew attention that the relationship between Rosneftu and Gazprom should be based solely on market principles.
The former head, Rosnefti-Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, explained that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for WNHC jeopardizes the duration of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom - on this issue was ongoing.
\"Gazprom\" suggests finding resources from the perimeter -- Rosnephti -- but we don't have -- added Sechin.
Recall that Rosnephti asked for permission to use the gas from the Kirin Valley Gazprom, located on the Sahalin shelf, for an east petrochemical company.

Did PJ Barcellon warn of Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris St. German will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of flying three years ago?
The Sensation Proposal revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neumar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as PJ offers him a salary of more than £500,000 per week clean.
It is known that Barcelona and the rage over the proposal and how Neumar broke up the contract despite the fact that, as the source close to the leadership of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done its best for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was not the football world warned of such a possibility three years ago by President PJ?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the 2014 employment of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a painful warning to every club that wanted to lure one of the best PJ players.
“I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going against them, we're going to make suggestions to their players,” said Al-Helaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.\"
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in a semi-protector from Marco Verratti's PJ.
The PJ has made it clear that the Italian player will not let go on any conditions, and it is likely that Barcelona will feel the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
