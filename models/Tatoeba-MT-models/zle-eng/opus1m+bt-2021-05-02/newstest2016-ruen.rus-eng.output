The social map of the resident of Ivanovsky is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the continuation of the benefit of public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, arrangements have been made for the transfer of citizens by means of a social map of the resident of Ivanovsk.
According to the press service of the Russian Government in the Ivanov region, the changes provide for the continuation of the public passenger travel allowance and the introduction of a social map calculation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the FZ - on the national payment system -
In doing so, the social map of the resident of the Ivanovian region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Consequently, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the replenishment limit is now set, not in travel as before, but in cash, while maintaining winter and summer periods by not more than 400 roubles in winter, and in summer, by no more than 800 roubles for the current month.
The users of a social card on receipts issued in transport would now need to track the cash balance rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of the concessionary travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the tariff for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel reimburses the district budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social card remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on a social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to record in detail the expenditure of money on the social chart with accuracy to the copies.
In addition, it is possible to recover unpaid but unspent money.
It is also added that the pattern of inter-accounting with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and the same amount reimburses the carrier with the budget.
No commission will be charged on a cash card.
Vassili Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road and Transport in Ivanov State, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social map trips had been made in the region, with almost 25 million trips in 2015.
More than 470 million roubles are provided for in the district budget for the provision of welfare accommodation for citizens.
As at 1 September, more than 312 million roubles had been reimbursed for this purpose.
During a 911 call, the teacher admitted to killing a friend
During a 911 call, the teacher of the University of Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot a friend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house that was alive, but probably upset, and said that the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police officers discovered Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was carelessly written on a white sheet of line paper: \"I'm sorry, I'd like to get it back, and I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me\" says in a note, according to representatives of the organs signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to go 300 miles to a university campus where police believed he had shot all the respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, on the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police of Delta State Lynn Baford reported that university officials had heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more thing: Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police had surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still tried to fit the motives that had led Lamb to.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told him that they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gothia, where Prentiss died, reported that he had no charges of violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the beautiful people with whom he crossed his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures from one and the other.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems to arise.
One student who spoke well of Lamba, Brandon Bivers, reported that he also seemed nervous and nervous, as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of his 2014-15 school year about how he coped with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctorate's degree, so hard to obtain by Lamb, would not have guaranteed him an automatic teacher post.
President William Laforge of the University reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but obviously Mr. Lamb had something in his mind--
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb's trail after he ran off campus when he went back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibres in the back yard of his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, one mile south of his parents' house, the coroner of Washington Meltel Johnson County.
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he had known the people living there.
Lamb grew up in those edges.
Lamb began working at a university of 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in the spring of that year.
One longtime friend of Lamb described him as intelligent, charismatic, and cheerful.
Carl Haurston told her she was 15, and Lambu was 20 years old when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy older who spent years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he was a successful woman.
All the girls were hiding when he was there, says Heirston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentis had apparently been dating for a while.
During a 911 call, Lamb said: “I killed my wife, but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lytning who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, the back of which comes out to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is 19 years old.
- She's totally depressed. She told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both spoke at one summer festival three years ago.
Then together they played at concerts from time to time.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman and co-maintainer of entertainment at the t-shirt of The Julep Room in Gothier's suburb, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentis on the evening of 5 September, Lamb finished playing guitar and sponge for the few visitors.
Nothing suspicious happened.
- Just a happy couple. - He said.
We were having fun and searching out each other.
I mean, they were both very sharp.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for the primary school and specialized in the stories of Native Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
On campus of the University of Delta in Cleveland, on Tuesday evening some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the candle-burning ceremony.
Schmidt Liz's wife and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The business will resume on Wednesday.
“ We are trying to get our students back,” said Laforge.
Crisis's over.
It's a day of recuperation.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press by Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that the Lamb's call went to service 911 after the murder of Schmidt and that while Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reported that they would not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, with the battery player and children's goods believing that they would allow staff and temporary staff to work longer hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would initiate interviews with applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the purchase season is getting closer before the holidays for a few months, companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have sufficient states in the shops and to sell, transport and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about dating with Princess Diana.
The film prime, Back to Future, proved to be a big event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
- We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place was open to me, and I was shaded up here, with Princess Diana sitting next to me, and he told me in the trailer to the soon-to-be documentary film - Back in Time -
The film starts, and here comes to my mind, that I'm literally in the distance of an outstretched hand and in one false zig from seeing Princess Wales.
- Back in time - a documentary on film - Back in the Future - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spilberg.
The movie's premiere - Back to the Future - was held 30 years ago.
For me, ” Spielberg says, \"it's certainly the greatest time travel movie ever taken--
- Back in time - will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN Head states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has responded to Russia's military support for Syria, that for a nearly five-year conflict - military solution - there is no - and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations called once again on all parties, including the divided United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had rendered the situation intractable -
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had shown in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 results from a survey showing Donald Trump is not joking
Some tried to label him as a provocation.
Others turned away from him, viewing him as a joke.
And some people are demanding scandals.
But as some Republicans try to win the high profile of Donald Trump in the results of the interviews, they did not succeed.
Ten of the last 11 national interviews have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means to a real estate magnet in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance of being nominated by the Republican Party.
The experts point out that, at this time in 2011, R. Perry gave in to her favorite, Hermann Kane, who was neither won nor one state in the process of nomination.
There are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But outside groups, such as \"The Counter-Committee of Political Activity \" , \" Jeb Bush \" , and the Economic Conservative Group, the Growth Club, recognize the unabated power of the Trump and begin to deliver their dollars in order to overthrow it.
Here are some numbers of interviews that show that the magnet of real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
The rails were pretty for Trump to turn 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about this property magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now responding positively to Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are at the beginning.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of Republicans there are very positive towards Trump.
Two thirds of the voters for GOP would have set up Trump as a candidate.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 per cent of Republicans said that they had either responded favorably or with satisfaction if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say that they would be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they'd be very happy about 40 per cent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next level of delight?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans say they'll be -- not satisfied -- or frustrated -- if Jab Bush's stable is to be nominated.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of Republicans throughout the country believe that magnets have the right temperament to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
The same figure appears in the first closed congregation in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think he's not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to it.
When they wear their badge hats, Republican voters think Trump's serious.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to CNN/ORC interview last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose R. Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to team up around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a gap is likely to be in favour of Trump, while at the same time the non-Tramp is evenly distributed among the supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-to-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
He is ahead of Carli Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paul, John Cassich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate around him?
Ben Carson chased a businessman over 19 points in a hypothetical competition -- one for one --
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only over half of Trump-supporting voters say they are sure of their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with an outsider colleague, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants two months ago, in his campaign statement, immigration has become the most relevant topic in the debate in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's position would deter key Latin American voters from participating in the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with the Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday, a new ABC/Post poll claims that they want a political outsider rather than a person with government experience.
And they're also wronged by Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed with the Republicans' activities in Congress, and 54 per cent were unsatisfied - and 21 per cent were violent -
The Government will decide on the fate of pension indices in October.
The vice-premier of the Olga Goldotz RF stated that the Government is now looking for options to implement the Pension Index Act in 2016 to be real inflation, and passes it to the WG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the following year into the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulation pension of Russians.
The hungry man noted that pension savings amounted to 350 billion roubles.
About the same is true for the next year ' s indexing of pensions in full.
According to the vice-premier, there is not yet a final solution to the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his or her own initiative and does not belong to socially disadvantaged categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him or her.
Previously, the media reported that two options for balancing the State budget were under consideration in the cabin.
Why is there so much irritation and beauty in the ages?
Says the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashov:
Our ages are the broads that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that inhabit them.
As we forget the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of the bible itself.
The output is simple:
Don't keep your eyes dirty with your hands, and carry with you a special wet nape for ages;
at least 1-2 times a day, cleanse the edges of the ages from the harmful substances stored in them in the day.
Cleaning procedures should also add to the warm compresses of curative herbs (shalfea, rumblings) that fuel the dense secret of the irons, and then to the massing of the edges of the ages, which should be carried out by circular finger-cushion movements;
Wash your makeup, don't use alcohol.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further thicken the secret of the iron.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclei created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yonben nuclear complex, is working at full capacity
This was reported on the site of the National Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to - aggression and the US nuclear threat - and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons in number and quality -
The last test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, there have been no plans to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang says he was able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tried medium- and short-range missiles, and has written polit.ru.
Zyrinovsky demanded that the mention of brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian hymn.
The leader of LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinowski, believes that the mention of a union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national hymna.
He stated this during the meeting of the State Council, reported to the Russian News Service -
Who are these peoples now?
The fascists and the killers!
- Very long hymne, the longest in the world, even sportsmen can't stand.' said Zhirinowski.
The MP is of the view that all the four should be removed from this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zyrinowski stated that the current hymna should be changed to - God, king of the grave - and Russian tricolor should be replaced by imperial flag, written polit.ru.
Asaad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria, Bashar Assad, called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Asad is sure that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must cease supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
That's our opinion on the issue.
- That's the point of the refugee question, - he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus-building.
However, if we want real success, they cannot be as long as people die, as long as they continue to bleed and as long as people do not feel safe.
“So we can reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we have defeated terrorism in Syria” emphasized Assad.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants, including Syria, arrived in the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current world migration crisis has been the largest since the Second World War.
There may be thousands of extremist militants — the Islamic State — among migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to set up their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city set up a holiday for the refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become the leader of refugee reception, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
It is estimated by the authorities that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts have referred to significant numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived.
Jenny Hill, a BBC correspondent, visited Darmstadt, where migrants have a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister ' s session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the Prime Minister ' s session is eagerly awaiting
Jeremy Corbin, the new Labour Party leader, will be addressing the Prime Minister for the first time in a session with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin would address the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his statement was likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for less theatre and more facts, in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech to the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the leader ' s decision to remain silent during the national hymna on Tuesday, during the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the British Battle, has been criticized by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing the State Gymn drew attention to
The Spokesman, Mr. Corbin, stated that he stood up in solemn silence and acknowledged the \"heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain\" -
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow cabinet, told Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Labourists to sing a national hymne - independent of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play Mr. Corbin's team, speaking out differences on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences would also be “stopped” in the Labour Party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin as European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had amended to abolish the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party was fully aware of the fact that it was only in opposition to the Government ' s plans to reduce the ceiling from Pound26,000 to Pound23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labourists, with whom David Cameron will meet at the chicken box, in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labourists, who had promised a different approach to politics, said that he had brought in collective resources to gain Mr. Cameron's ideas and received over 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Ailington North District said that the Prime Minister ' s questions were causing undue confrontation and that he would refrain from harsh responses and the exchange of collegies, instead promising to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economics in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with a Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkow, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to get away from the political style of the Jarmar Ballan, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics have argued that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.

Pound Sterling is growing as wages grow in Britain.
Pound has grown against the background of the increase in wages in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to the SABMiller purchase proposal.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate has been highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to an earlier date in projections for possible increases.
The Pound Sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar, to $1.5505, and by 0.84% against the euro, to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index has grown to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
A common background was the SABMiller shares, which grew by 20% through the purchase proposal from AB InBev.
The deal would unite two of the world’s largest brewery companies, gathering brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni, and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9 per cent amidst encouraging news from the competing group of retailers of the Lux Richemont class.
The latest data on Richard's sales exceeded expectations and showed that China's sales -- in the key market for Burberry -- had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose by 5 per cent after the mining giant announced that it had succeeded in obtaining $2.5 billion through equity placement, which was done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi Paper and Packaging Group ' s shares were the leaders of the drop in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group ' s rating to - to sell -
JD Sports shares grew after the sports clothing supplier reported an 83 per cent increase in revenue prior to the six months tax, up to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can interfere with expansion
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Kaugill said that raising the minimum wage for British workers meant greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers -
But it's unlikely that such a purchasing power would outweigh the increase in the cost of labor, he says.
Costs could have an impact on plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could have meant a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Mettash is launching a bottom-up campaign to combat the pressures of Aldi.
Mettash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier launched the IGA market share protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia at the bottom of the initiative, in light of the forthcoming injection by Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of the 120 shops in South and Western Australia early next year, Mettash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote IGA brands through marketing in leading media and social networks and in activities like Adelaide Show -
The campaign is joined by ritlers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tasting at IGA stores and shopkeepers who sell tickets to the soccer League of South Australia football matches with discounts.
Mettash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day when this wholesale supply of food, alcohol and farm products will spend its annual investor strategy day.
Much has been done because in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA brand stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Mettash shops and show higher profitability than the Mettash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to be followers of the customary routes, so the market is more favourable for IGAs than for New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will consume 5 per cent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of their first stores, taking away from all players present, but mostly from independent pilots.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA's pilots could lose $360 million per year in sales and Mettash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 shops in WA, making sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets, respectively.
The loss of income and the sale of food at high constant cost to Mettash could cost companies about 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Mettash is losing its share in the market in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is estimated that Mettash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the lead stock manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed present at a business dinner in Melbourne that Mettash could disappear within a decade.
Mettash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Mettash board of directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The market share of IGAs declined from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and the business income of Metttash for food, which is supplied by the company to some 1,200 IGAs, fell by 43 per cent over 2012 due to the operating business and the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not surrender, spending more than $150 million each year to balance retail prices with Coles and Woolworths in thousands of positions every week, and helping IGA pilots to renovate trades, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider range of manufactured foods.
Director-General Mettash Ian Morris said that price equation and improvements in trading spaces were gaining momentum and hoped that the company would make a net increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilli
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be respected, not criticized for his conduct.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected in a recent scandal surrounding his friend, Nick Kiryos, and more than criticism is worth his conduct, as President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy, says.
Kokkinakis, a junior in a talented duet and often called Speculative Ks, was involuntarily in focus because of Kyrios' shameful quarries with Stan Vavrinka on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during the hot qualification match at Cincinnati, the Vishka judge had to double the Kokkinakis and his opposer Ryan Harrison, while Harrison stated: \"Vavrinka should have put it on Kyreos blades, and I must have put it on this guy's blades.\"
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a rocket after a swath in his leg saved Rishar Gaske from a possible US Open strike, Hillie loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in solitary confinement in the semi-final of Davis' Cup v. Great Britain.
- I'm really worried about one thing, that's what Tanasi got involved in the conflict.
He really broke the rocket when he had a US Open foot, but he wasn't the first player to catch a rocket when hope broke, and I know Tanasi is good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he owned very well in relatively provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little bit unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working a lot, he's good at the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensively trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated and well-developed young man, and I think he should be judged in dignity.
He also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important Friday match, with the prospect that he would return to the team as a long-term player.
“We want the team to focus entirely on the match rather than on the disputes around [Kyroos],” said Hilli.
And I think Nick's gaining power very quickly, which is proof by people like Federer and Marrey, he's growing up in public eyes, he's making a series of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's important that he get his attention out of the center for a while so he can reflect on them, and it's best for the team and best for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Having announced the state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally to keep the flow of migrants flowing inside.
There were unrest on the border, with hundreds of migrants digging into the border territory, to which Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
Stucked at an uncertain time in the section of the road between the checkpoints of two countries, people fleeing armed violence from their homeland broke tents and settled in that area.
However, there was a lack of satisfaction.
When a police helicopter was hovering over them, the migrants were shouting - Open the border - and shouting insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared it unacceptable to expel migrants from Hungary when they arrived more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not the accompanying damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries should be held in the coming days,” said Ivica Dacić in Prague.
The fighting on the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in crowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that 120,000 additional refugees, including refugees from Hungary, will be reached in the future (the next month or the end of the year).
The chancellor of Germany, Angel Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded the convening of an emergency summit of the European Union next week to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The announcement on Tuesday of a state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Syyarto, stated that his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire at the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had finished taking over on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete a barbed wire takeover between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major narrow place and a point of crossing the Euro-Community border, many of which are refugees victims of wars in Syria and in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people who arrive in the country are economic migrants who seek a better life rather than refugees who are victims of hostilities who have the right to protection, and this view differs sharply from that of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
New laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now constitute the crime of crossing or damaging a four-metre (13-foot) barbed wire, built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.
“In view of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency” said a representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern town of Szeged.
We clearly understand that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but reports from the Associated Press, which are on the border, have been there for several days to observe the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Djerd Bacondi, counsel of Orbán on national security, reported that 45 people had been caught by authorized authorities trying to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, were currently in police custody and were charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings at the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, forcing a railway car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots broke out on the main crossing of the town of Ryoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pushed one another to break inside.
Some 20 people were able to penetrate, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced their refusal of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Election 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders was halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for being nominated all over the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders reaches for it.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary Democrats (below 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Byden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is receiving the support of 15 per cent of the primary Democrats.
More than five months before the primary elections began, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident of their choice than those supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage for women and the moderates, but that has been reduced.
Her support for men fell significantly, and Sanders lags behind her at only five points.
Clinton's preference for Democratic voters for 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton chased Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democrats across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A fourth would support it with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
Perhaps it is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to show more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more controversial - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 per cent of primary Democrats say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trumpe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question why they want to see her, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then the time for a female president (13 per cent) is now, and that she is the best candidate for that position (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also talk about an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called agreement on issues and chances for election.
As the Vice-President is considering the potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary Democrats would like him to join the race - although a third believe that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, the primary Democratic voters are mostly known as Baiden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said they'd choose Baiden the second, that's more than Sanders'.
If Baiden chooses not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate to win the general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
By this indicator, the Baiden had a large gap in the second place, but the percentage of those who considered it to be the most likely candidate had increased.
Nevertheless, in answering the question that the most important thing in a candidate is that Democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, the situation last month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nomination for these primary voters.
Democrat candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key characteristics of the primary voters in their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Byden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Baiden of all three is honest, and the strong side of Clinton is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary Democrats do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally regard Clinton, Sanders and Baiden as similar ideological views.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the Democrat voters have no opinion on Sanders.
Although questions regarding the personal e-mail box and the server at Hillary Clinton are continuing in the capacity of its Secretary-General, most of the primary Democrat voters are satisfied with its explanation of this matter and believe that this has not adversely affected their general view of it.
But this is a completely different story from that of the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
This was shared by the public back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail has had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of her has deteriorated.
These are mainly Republicans, over six of every 10 who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even with Clinton considering her party to be honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six tested candidates, Baiden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see an honest person in Sanders rather than no, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The limit of error for the sample of 351 primary Democrats is 6 percentage points.
As a result of a national survey, Ben Carson was close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came across Donald Trump in a recent CBS/New York Times survey
Two of these candidates won half the vote in the new interview, leaving everyone left behind in search of a foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump extensively, whose percentage of support has increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday interview.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support from all population groups, hindering Trump in the Republican voter group with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carlie Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, went back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Haqabi, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, together, ranks third with 6%.
The limit of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey was held in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in interviews, showing 19% support for Republicans, followed by Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's support grew last week, Trump made a number of critical advances towards the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for having questioned Trump's faith.
\"We need energy.\" Trump said last Saturday, closing the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a high school student at Baruch
About two years after the death of a college student, a murder charge was brought against five people in the Pocono brotherhood in Pennsylvania.
Pil Delta Psi's brothers from the New York College Baruch brutally assaulted Chana-Michae-Denga during the September 2013 dedication ceremony and failed to bring him to hospital on time, causing his death, reported to the police.
Officials say a student with eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to reach a goal by walking down a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P-Delta Psi's fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they waited an estimated hour before taking him to the hospital, they say to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask advice, as reported at the press conference by police chief Chris Wagner.
“ At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above Michael Deng’s health,” said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered some blunt head injuries, torsos and thighs.
“A lot of families have been affected by brotherhood rituals, since at least one student dies each year, beginning in 1970, when Douglas Faierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in his statement.
The brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
The jurors of the Monro county were inclined in favour of third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against the novice and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all of this either formally or informally, it and so on,” stated Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Rate increases will occur and bull markets will stumble, bond returns will rise, and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take, and how long it will last.
There is little time for the economy specifically.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first rate increase and for 86 months.
The severity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The US Central Bank Administration therefore insists that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates but on how much adaptation they will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the jokes about rate increases are exaggerated.
The first rate rise by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end-of-the-money signal,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the United States to be more normal, but still low will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could be reacted according to historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or so, waiting for rates to rise may lead to some volatility.
However, the effects are not usually so dramatic when the rate is higher.
It's impossible that the shares' revenues will be suspended 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy - the analysts say Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the Federal Reserve rate increases.
If more specifically, the market over the last 35 years is more often changed - about 14 per cent - towards upward rates - remains fairly flat within 250 days after that (the average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, is returned to normal with an average return rate of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief equity strategy specialist at Nuveen Messenger Management published in Barron's.
In Deutsche, the result of securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate rise, and the stock revenues begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate increases often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is subject to conditions that did not exist earlier and could accelerate the recession.
For the most part, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point during the entire life of the upward rate.
In 118 cases, Deutsche Bank stated that only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though he was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that this is for a long time, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates on such unstable economic backgrounds may be risky and may raise the question, would this time be different, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve System for the entire year, with their view tied to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
To date, many policy makers and economists believe that FOMC could approve the rate increases at this meeting, future trade only represents a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study from 1950, all rate increases to date were in the supercycle of an increasing financial lever, with GDP overlapping peaks precipitating recession very quickly after the recovery -” the report states.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession during the period chosen.
The current cycle is the longest one that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, which is 74 months long and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for rates to rise, a scenario that is somewhat similar to that implemented for shares.
The fundamental difference is that in bonds the effect will be faster than in stocks when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rise/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase, the bond returns immediately drop, reports Deutsche.
Strategy specialists at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring long-term and short-term bond returns closer together by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although - we are still afraid of fluctuations in income - says Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system's policies.
In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has built up a tighter monetary policy -- it has written.
Interest rates on short-term loans went up, income curves were flat, credit fronts increased, volatility increased - all characteristics of the market increased while the federal system policy was tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
International debt companies would be in a worse position as the growing dollar made their products more expensive in the world market and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
History shows that `quality' shares demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial rate increase `-- said analysts Goldman Sachs in a customer report.
Stable financial companies bypassed unstable companies on an average of 5 percentage points in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
High capital income companies, as well as low-volatile shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
High interest companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Intakers could also see profit through higher returns, although experts differ in how fast it will happen.
BBC Radio 3 - copy of Classic FM - states a member of Parliament from conservative Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the station for reducing standards -
Evidence that it is becoming less and less distinct from a commercial competitor
He's also targeting BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize's just sod with Brits.
Damien Collins, the Parliamentary College, which was subjected to the same criticism, was not originalized by
BBC Radio 3 turns into a Classic FM, said a leader of Parliament, encouraging teleradiocom to prove that she was doing anything that business companies did not do.
Member of Parliament from conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that public radio seems to be \" stupid \" and is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
Radio 3 seems to -- I don't like to use the word \"simplification\" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM -- he said.
He also targeted BBC Music Awards last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like the Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- here's two examples that came first to me in my mind, where you're really just copying what's in the market -- said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director-General has rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and the education of the audience.
What I'm going to learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music is not really comparable to anyone else.
- So really important, I think, Radio 3's interest in finding new music and in promoting new works, - he said.
Earlier this year, manager of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than they had in the past, because British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for being on heels by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tori Damien Collins, a member of Parliament, attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
Can you see why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctiveness?
Lord Hall claims that BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feith and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the BBC style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find Ta' in her own home horse - the next time she started a fun project.
However, he does not think it necessary to prevent the ordering of new The Voice seasons in the future or the use of money by those paying the licence fees on other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales has slowed as far as possible in August, and the fault may therefore be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase of 7 per cent in online sales.
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile spyware
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could contribute to the control of costs
For about a decade, the virtual skipping has been experiencing a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say that now there are signs of online sales leveling, after recent data have shown only a seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown a minimal increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of online sales leveling, after recent data have shown only a seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
- If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000 they always got a reasonable explanation - told Guardian Andy Malcahey, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But it's on the plateau right now, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slow down of sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from purchasing on the eve of the last Friday of November.
During the past year, customers five times more than average rushed to computers to make good use of the offers, thereby disrupting a number of seller websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real fight for a lucrative purchase, could have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold via online motorways.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online than do fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims were killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family was subject to sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident for the Saudi Binladin Group construction giant
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons had also been injured following the collapse of the tap
Hundreds of Muslims fled all over the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the crane's collapse at Mecca's main mosque.
The clothes mainly in white, the ones present at the funeral filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of those who had died, who were on their last journey to the al-Moaissem cemetery.
The fiery procession passed by, passing through a sacred place where, just a few days earlier, the building crane had pierced the ceilings of the mosque and fell upon its citizens.
The bodies were issued for the funeral and, at the same time, King Saudis was fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 persons were also injured.
The bodies of 29 persons who died in the collapse of the crane at the Main Mosque were carried on the streets
Among those killed were the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Grand Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane struck.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left a tap shot raised in an unworkable tap.
The Arab version of a decree issued by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of assault.
The English version of the news agency did not detail this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the main mosque’s yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had fled to go to the hut this month.
Binladin Group made no statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of failing to harmonize properly with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Main Mosque, as part of the large-scale construction work conducted by the Binladin Group.
Ben Laden's family has been among the close-up ruling families of Saudi Arabia for decades and has led major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a changer who rejected the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in the life of every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irreversibly mutilated.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to Eastern European small-money artists
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair workers
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - opening up more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouse stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, principal city correspondent, Daily Mail
British are said to be putting their hands on hammers and painters, but instead to hire skilled East Europeans to do housework.
If you're able to treat a hammer, or you're able to paint walls, it seems like you're a minority these days.
Because, according to B&Q, British people are still hiring master workers to do complex housework.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of housekeeping services, reported that there was a significant influx of skilled artists from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops specializing in artifacts and to close 60 B&Q warehouse stores at the same time.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, as eight out of 10 shop decisions were made by weak shopkeepers.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, characterized by an increasing number of households made up of single women who were more engaged in housing arrangements than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Ms. Lori said: “Our shops are still mostly men.
Steps should be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on commodities are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in the lead of the British companies whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching out to the directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and the Director-General.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification, an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women at the board of directors was not easy.
After the group took over the closing costs of the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new shops.
Decision time at US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is monitoring the Federal Reserve Bank meeting, which is discussing, within two days, the most important decision to raise or not have a interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who had thought that the Federal Reserve would do that last week now believed that it would continue and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced its rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move away from the zero mark and begin the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, lead member of Peterson ' s Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy works effectively, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that changes should be prepared, but all of them indicated that they were confident that all of the chances were against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees travel to the EU through Croatia.
- Open - scan hundreds of refugees at the Khorgosh crossing on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday Budapest has closed the border for settlers.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to discover other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia across Romania.
Another through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now on their way to Shidu City on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered to proceed without stops.
Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Neboša Stepanović assures his country that it is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe can do it alone, and all the more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not wish to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is unswerving:
If someone names himself as a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, we'll never let him in, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary had already erected a 175-tylometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this point: he plans to erect the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Gospelist Maemarakis: \"Europe wants to help us\"
For a number of years, Vangelis Maemarakis joined the right-wing governments, who left the country in view of the financial crisis.
Now he, as the party's temporary leader, the New Democracy, is challenging Cypros.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronus.
Euronius: Mr. Maemarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Gospelis Maemarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronus: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy has been compared to its popularity.
What has changed over this time period?
We've changed Greece, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago Greece had fiscal surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them out.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tzipros.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Today ' s life has been markedly worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win, you're going to seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
Gospelis Maemarakis: The fact is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, the political forces and all the governing parties have met together to implement the programme on which they have agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronus: Your party voted in favour of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maemarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's European movement, because we are well aware of the devastating effects that the withdrawal from the EU would have had.
Europe is now helping us by subsidizing our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a package of Junker and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current severe economy was the result of Mr. Tzipros' negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government, in its first year, wants order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to think that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are awaiting full implementation of the agreement.
If we wish to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Tsypras Government has not made any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of the incomes of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that this was not a fixed monthly income, so he could not be taxed entirely in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were neither prepared nor ill-informed, and thus failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronus: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Junker, Olland, Mrs. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you will say differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras said to them?
Wangelis Maemarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we had tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the acute angles in it.
We have moved the reform forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under emergency circumstances.
The market fell and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek Government.
I was a Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were the government majority at the time.
Despite their serious ideological differences under key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations from outside.
We have managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronus: The recent weeks have seen a massive flow of refugees moving across Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries to which these people seek?
Gospelis Maemarakis: The refugee crisis is a time-consuming bomb that we have to deal with after we win an election.
The reason is that the Government of SIRISA has not acted in this situation as it should have.
Such matters should be advanced because, if the problem pervades you, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in that situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS did more in just seven days than Mr. Tzipros did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim Government, which has been greatly assisted by the President of the Republic who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice refugees who are illegal immigrants.
It's the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maemarakis, thank you for your interview.
Angelis Maemarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Drotkovka Donetska province, during the day, criminal investigators from the Directorate General of the Police of the region, together with military counterintelligences, found and detained a suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from Kriwa Horna (Dnepropetrov district), who, prior to the evening, fired from his gun during the joint consumption of alcohols and a conflict in the village of Upper York City of Donetschina, fired his gun at his opponent.
A 22-year-old man was injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired leg wounds.
As Artem Vasicky, deputy director of the police chief's criminal investigation department, explained in the course of the operational action, the security forces proved that the figure was involved in another serious criminal offence: the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operators found that there had been a conflict between the suspect and another local resident on the same day, causing the man a fatal fire wound in the head.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been opened by the DPA Investigation Division.
Detainees are at risk of up to 15 years of imprisonment.
Figurant was detained and detained in a temporary detention facility, and was reported to the police at the Donetsk district press service.
Two of the inhabitants of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in Ukrainian flag colour, including two of Vladimir Lenin's monuments, were sentenced by a Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents were sentenced to restrictions on their freedom.
The residents of Novosibirsk received prison sentences of 2.5 years and 2 years.
Two other convicted persons were restricted to 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the CRCR and Trikotryna Street, as well as the Memorial complex, the Slava Monumment,
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of 12 December, in the city of Novosibirsk, unknown people painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag on Monument of Glory.

Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition for everything.
Evgeny Gypsy, 36 years old.
He's an actor in Moscow's theatre, Master's Petra Famenco.
It's known in the films of \"The Walk\" -- \"The Space as a Premonition\" -- \"Bristy Strong\" -- \"The series \"Ottepel\" -- and \"Farza\" --
On 8 September, Eugeny Gyganov was recognized as “Actor of the Year” and“ Man of the Year, on the version of the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his friend at Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he regretted the first murder and wanted to get it back.
Police in Gothie, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people to his home.
He said: \"Yesterday I killed my wife -- and also mentioned that there is a dog in the house -- that doesn't touch anyone -- but is probably upset.
The police asked about the caller's name, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
On arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found Amy Prentiss' body there 41 years, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying: “I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and killed himself on Monday night when he was surrounded by police.
Rector of William Laforge University reported that he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but there was clearly something in his mind--
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported that there was no information or evidence - any triangle -
It was called \"o-good man,\" Sean O'Stin, who said he was married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss have a daughter who's 19 and she's unsatisfied.
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were the best friends
According to Lindsay Knowles, a newspaper called San Herald, called a close friend, Prentiss, the latter worked from home on the Internet.
Knowles told me that Prentis had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said: “She always wanted to help the people...
According to the police, Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to say that he wouldn't go to jail.
On the same evening that the police caught him on highway 1 — not far from Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the forest, and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university site, Lamb received his Ph.D. in the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
The stars that lost their luck
Acter (left), in a photograph with his son, Redmond (right), has been through some difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing mate, Farru Fosett, who had died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug addiction and he was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this, of course, has played its part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United left for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the League of Champions match, where Manchester United lost a PSV in Eindhoven.
While the lawyer is concerned that he will not be able to go out into the field for at least six months, Louis van Hal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless podcast on the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penal zone.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and oxygenated before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gale said, \"He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital,
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or afternoon later, and then they'll operate.
It's terrible that a young man came to Manchester United at 18 years of age, got through a lot of trouble and started playing fantastically, and this is where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask on the locker.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card and no toolbar assigned.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Hal believes the Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge yourself, when I say it's worth a drink and a red card.
It was a very bad two-foot roll.
Twitterer Shaw writes: “Thanks to all for your messages, not to describe how I am devastated, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more strongly than I was —
Still on the theme: Manchester United is having a bad time with Luke Shaw when he's hit with a PSV game.
The English defender will have an additional incentive to adjust to the European Champion in France next June.
Philip Coke, a PSV coach, said: “It's a very serious trauma.
When any player gets out of this trauma, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno moved his leg fractures when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gali at the 2014 Peace Cup.
It's very hard for him now, because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious trauma, you're feeling sick, '\" Kok said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in a different direction, so it looked like it touched him, but I didn't see a podcast under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno, he said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Did David Cameron know anything else?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll take some time before you get to know it almost in vain.
Unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question posed by a member of a holiday child’s company about his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister chose “Lorax” as an environmental tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: \"This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children, because it always reveals some kind of image or message that we miss.\"
It would be nice, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to reconquer the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of a single-named film made in 2012 with new characters and details added to reproduce a rather short original narrative.
“In the high walls of the town of Domnuville, where there was no greenness and even air was sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of her dream, fulfilling her desire to see the real tree — we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Seuz (the real name of Theodore Sues Geisel) who died in 1991.
If this seems rather suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film's story, Lorax, posted on the Internet Movie Database: \"In the high walls of the town of Domnujville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl's dream --
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally active parent, would be so ignorant of the contents of a book that a non-named boy would learn of the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree cut-offer and by a knotter, Nachajkins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is in the title of the book), a funny substance with his lips, who will speak on behalf of the trees -
Most likely, such an easy PR task was entrusted to the perpetrator who had never read a book on Lorax to the child on 20 consecutive occasions.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had allegedly been obtained from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been made.
For Adam, Lithuania was clearly at risk of not getting into the compiled England, but it's still a complex issue.
The victory of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the assembly that England chose for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time, I don't think I'm likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my field either.
The Alistair Cook team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players among those who beat it, virtually taking the ball, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring with them scars from 2012, but only the boy's positive.
With Moen Ali's ball, he turns into a bowler giving the ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the other hand, Adam Lith left England on a test cricket replaced by Alex Hayles.
The decision to exclude Adam Little to me, his principal coach in Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
At his seven test matches, he had two good attacks in difficult circumstances, and the obvious but brutal reality is that the players in cricket are judged by the outcome judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I used to say this) players choose their own best.
A couple of semi-soldiers, and Lithuania could wait for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there's another possibility.
The head coach in assembly in England, Trevor Bayliss, was well aware of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take before the bats of the test cricket have the impression that it is a difficult question.
Let's play seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trottt for the Caribbean Premier League when Lithuania was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hayles shows up, and he's a batsman, whom I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he was working 236 against us at the Trent Bridge site, which was something.
It must at least be given the same opportunity as those before it, but it will certainly depend on the team's composition in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening bat, which would allow me to introduce an extra spinner, keeping four speed bowlers in mind, and I don't mind it at all.
I don't see why a beater can't hit a ball there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Woostershire, but became the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 third-beat test match before going out as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred and he didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a back-up spinner, and with my brief contact with him, he has proved to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risk rate, but there's a little bit of voice spinners out there, and those who choose to be young.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys to play with, and he's going to bring into it the wealth of experience gained under all possible conditions and in any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a settap.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, be it a game or a training job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the stripping room, even if they say what they said earlier, can give new strength to the team.
The College of the Darem Ben Stokes team is left behind for single-days, and Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I am not having any trouble with it for example.
Although not all agree, coaches and players do not set the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their position depends on the outcome.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
Britain's European Union withdrawal camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unimaginable policy of relaunching negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without a review of the election of Genitive Jeremy - This is yes or no - Corbin's leader of the Labourists or the TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the day that, in the current situation of the EU with various crises - not all of them in their own manufacture - some of the participating countries are sitting in the throat of the British egocentric bill of open concessions and disrupting the agreements of change that they do not want to do.
After meeting in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn't want them in any way if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it \"Devee and George's serf programme\"
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are riding at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against a well-known local monument, to or without local celebrities, and then coming home and saying that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to keep the outside contacts in Britain under the shadow of the Eurosoil - - Don't leave us with France - says Berlin - suggests that the sentry ministers and officials in some capitals get to understand when they're going to do whatever they want, stay or leave.
Angel Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before her situation deteriorates as she deteriorated for her sit-in, Thatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kola (16).
French head François Olland stands before election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon obtain a right-wing nationalist government, Spain left.
It's hard to see them lying out of their skins to help -- serfi-brits -- whose energy could have been spent to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK -- which they don't want because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to hand over deliberately useless remacks in the SNP style during the 2017 referendum campaign in Great Britain, in order to trigger Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend expects.
The revision was an idea-fix-and-Britnia received nothing of value from the resumed negotiations-
Europeans are aware of their plight as the predator of Flint Street, and as skeptical of the EU, there are media magnets, unlike Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry of 2:1 in 1973.
They may be sad to remember Boris Johnson, a European opportunist rooted in his EU direct bananas, the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
At all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a construction company made up of tax-fearing hives, telephone gun-hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he was aware that when you're in a big-till cage, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you on lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair accepted the principles of a reversed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who was a friend of mine on the back of Westminster on Monday -- I told him that he had no more time to spend on me -- seems to be at risk of repeating the strategy of Neil Kinoka the Merdoku Rabco -- of the '80s -- a mistake, then and now.
It may take time, but he must have developed a consistent strategy to interact with the press, not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I'm very delicately calling evolution.
He said he wanted us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and the wider community of small England parties are likely to say yes to the thorium.
That's the same thing as Hillary-Benn, but not Binnit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his domestic combatist refused to acknowledge that the appointment of Corbin as the unbridled John McDonnell-tenev, Minister of Finance, was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-in-law was struggling with TV for being illogical about colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his position in the Cabinet.
The Battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay -- in all circumstances -- is Benna's phrase -- not what McDonnell said, nor what J. K. told the vices and members of Parliament at a private meeting Monday night in general terms.
In order to tell the Democrat and his boyfriend Corbin, remember, he has touched even me - the discipline of messages remains an important seven-day-a-day-a-day television age, especially in the waterfront of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron get away from Europe as easily, allowing him to accept the support of the Labourists in the referendum campaign as MacDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But MacDonnell and Corbin's main mishap about EU membership, within the framework of the Beninite economy, is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of a slight difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misdeeds about Nato - Tom Watson, it is unswerving that J.K. will not go out - foreign diplomats will have to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions, when it could be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed at the weak military action of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the Government of the Tators in power cutting costs, which I was reminded of on Monday during a luncheon in a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government-funded agency to the effect that 95 per cent of electronic cigarettes were less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom were tobacco-related, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) jointly criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE published an important report, the \"returning milestone\" last month, called it a comprehensive review of the evidence.
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In a editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized — an extremely shocking argument — on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether the statements had valid or unsubstantiated grounds -
Martin McKee, a professor of European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “Fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness”
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that, as the best estimate indicates, electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco - based on detailed evidence and modelling.
In fact, this comes from the only meeting of 12 people to develop a multi-criteria decision-making model to summarize their views on the harm caused by various nicotino-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that a co-sponsor of the meeting had been a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had been informed that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the area of health in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly received previously from Philip Morris, a tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation was provided for the selection of Board members, but there were several well-known electronic cigarette supporters, some of whom also claimed to finance the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in managing the tobacco case.
The manager of the tobacco field in PHE also visited the meeting.
A scientific article published by the group would certainly agree that there was insufficient evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria, such as McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell told me that PHE's statements that there is no evidence at the moment that electronic cigarettes are expensive to drive children or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health and Welfare Direction, explained that BMJ had previously responded.
He explained: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco,
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote effects.
PHEs have a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and fails to prove these evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative dangers of comparing tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs $2 billion per year.
Clearly indicating that while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they do only part of the harm caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks before the nation.
Former chapter Channel 4 believes that BBC has to stop the EastEnds show
Former chap. Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given up a lot for successful shows like the soap opera about \"The Albert Square\"
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to create programmes that were not produced by other British television companies.
He criticized BBC for putting in broadcasts of public broadcasting, which are certainly only a small part of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors have high ranking shows, and on channels like BBC4.
After the BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had been unsuccessful in his six years of unsuccessful cooperation with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
“I cannot separate myself from the idea that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could show non-subsidized competing companies” told the members of the House of Lords Communications Committee to clarify the future fate of BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, that I don't think I'm a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only leave on air those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is on air in the prime slot because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of nobody showing him anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it's common knowledge that they're their own production.
Other channels would no doubt have given much for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don't think it would be demeaning to BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings - because of staff ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to obtain long-term support -
His comments on the most popular BBC show echo the comments made by Sky Executive Director Tony Boll, who, in his 2003 lecture to McTaggart in Edinburgh, offered BBC to sell EastEnds series.
Johnson observed that more public BBC transfers continue to go to BBC4, where the audience is often unappreciated, but the company's function has been performed, and this could be brought up as an argument in the Ganges sermons justifying revenue from licence fees of £4 billion: “Yes, of course, we are making all these incomprehensible transfers that no one is watching.”
They're putting them in slots where no one can ever watch them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson informed the committee: “I encourage you to find a more regressive system with regard to who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money, I wonder, they think they're not really watching and listening to BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “information, education and entertainment”
He noted that only a small portion of BBC output was now formally classified as educational - in his words, 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent of radio content - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters with a motto - information, preaching and entertainment -
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as “Frequent concerts” (only part of them said to be on TV) and should engage in alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
- Sonogenetics - allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows the nematodes changing direction when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound - wave pulses.
The tiny nematodes change direction of motion as sound pulses affect them, too high, so that the human ear can hear them.
The pulses are influenced by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Still on the subject: Researchers control brain activity by light
Scientists have explained that worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called sonogenetics, the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to trigger certain cells of the brain, heart, and muscles, and the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, an academic at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worm’s bodies.
Increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which have been found in the membranes of some cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and trigger the cells that bind to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During ultrasound exposure to modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered by worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right section of the brain through the optics, low - frequency ultrasound waves pass freely through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to be transported inside the skull box.
“We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal for a period of time,” said Chalassani.
He added that, in addition, the technique could be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.
Banned torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertising is being mocked by the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's stand against an arms show.
Brilliant killer drones!
Ruining iron cands!
Cassette bombs!
Electric glowing batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no traces!
The bodrian voice and drawing animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a liquid parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to push for arms to the repressive regimes, taking advantage of the defence technology and security systems display in the centre of ExCeL at Doclense.
Still on the theme: DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian regimes going to London
But a special campaign has also led to the sudden emergence of many posts at bus stops and subway trains that require another look at them.
- The important DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September - is written in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line becoming the tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will join DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent weapons exhibition.
300 posts are painted by artists who show their work at the \"Museum of Cruel Design\" in Banksy-Dismaland-
The team, Special patrol, helped distribute them to London using a set of advertising sites, a six-pound set of gaekeys, which is said to provide access to about a third of the world's bus space*
The transporters of London were not afraid of such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Group - Special patrol -
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and professor at Essex University, artists are more demanding and seek to bring political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibit welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a pro bono VCCP agency with a graphic designer and sound artist also working free of charge.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was struck by the advertising silence around an arms show -- with an ExCel pass -- and thought, \"Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid --
They thought to create a more realistic and clever corporate advertisement, but to fill it at home with bright colors and animations proved to be a more exciting occupation -
- They incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment to the exhibition. - Says Tom Davies from Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemetic products.
Saab's press release revealed the order at the AT4CS RS for a shoulder shot, which came from the U.S. Army.
It includes a “no similar cumulative warheads, which produce uncontaminated weaponry within the target”.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student's dormitories as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in bereaves and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the intense smiles of those I have irritated -- and the many long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be laid down in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm may vary from slightly nervous to totally frightening.
He encourages you to gossip: to tell people where you're from, whether you've taken an academic vacation and where you've spent it, whether you're supporting Corbina and why you're being honest, love, or hate Marmait because, seriously, guys, it's just a dreary extract of HAHAHAHA, I'll be at my own place.
Just take a breath.
And help others to pause, too, ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had the rescrews, and they would have given you fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
Rooms of people often turn into drinking establishments, moonskins, and common carnivores, but they are also the place where people dress and correct underwear.
On the other hand, don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are unfair.
Your room should be a safe haven, but many dormitories shape the culture of chatting from one room to another, which fosters friendship, communication, and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, \"I like you, and I want to continue my friendship with you, but I need you to leave, and I can recover the energy I spent talking to you.\"
Try to feel like a fellow student is tired of having a conversation, not getting used to it, but sending text messages.
Oh, knock, do it.
One guy in my living room followed the principle that if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends by baking.
Since you're starting a university life on the face of the performance of the Bake-Off show, it's not that strange of the 1950s to knock on the door to people to introduce yourself and bring you a plate of chocolate livers, not that strange of them -- Welcome, we're neighbors, and now you're having a smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions --
Offering homemade entertainment is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Bad sightings of flour, sugar, and fat will rather make people pretend to be sleeping when you reach them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the embezzlement of someone's chicken is stealing, but isn't it stealing to take a little bit of tea milk?
Do it to the owner of the milk.
He'll probably tell you not to be upset, even if he boils from rage inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry to you, but try to take it older than my neighbor who poured dishwashing liquid into his milk to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You must not make noises that prevent people from sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people talking about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to lose the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since she had a three-hour exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased his loudness.
When he finally remained silent at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut off his music and locked the door behind him for a three - hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse had settled in the same dormitories as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, until the elbow bite, no matter what, if you took your neighbour as your future spouse, got involved, broke up, and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him drag on to his side all your friends?
Of course, you won't tell your heart, but if your future mate's not exactly a hot neighbor, try to cool your own dust slightly.
At that exciting moment, when you realize someone's left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between the play and the grass is cheaper than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns into a contrast in seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting security lesson by hiding something, but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
If you lock someone's door and put the keys in a glass of water you'll put in the freezer - but don't glue someone's stuff with a Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the upgrade is released from Apple
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, selecting General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you jump and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation, when there is a report of an error telling them that “The update of the annex has failed”
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until the recovery is deadened or try to resume with iTunes.
The phone hints will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removing applications to increase the free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of the action by reducing the update size and has also simplified the implementation by means of a special utility that proposes to remove the annexes and re-install them once the process is completed.
Make sure that your phone is loaded or adjacent to the charger when you do the upgrade to prevent the battery from discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the upgrade, as defusing the phone may result in a failure of the upgrade.

You need to make sure that you've seen our check-list of what needs to be done before jumping to try and make it stop doing something wrong, and to protect yourself from doing something if that doesn't work. New functions, including enhanced personal helpers, and innovations that increase iPad productivity, as well as settings that increase speed and improve the operating system, are now included in iOS 9.
Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a telephone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow ' s military support to President Asad has only contributed to the escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague about this, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
PJ Media reports this.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad by Russia creates a risk of an increase in the conflict, and also has a negative impact on our common objective of combating extremism - unless we also continue to concentrate on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power - representatives of the United States Department of State stated.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State -- within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States will be pleased to have Russia ' s constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State -
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
Yet, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone call between President Barack Obama of the United States and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: “When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will go to our advantage, he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for Assad's regime by a winning bet*
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake that the continued support of Assad would only worsen the situation.
“But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation deteriorated - the President of the United States said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Development intends to release temporarily imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
Changes to the list of temporary duty-free goods have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported on this.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, commissioned a number of institutions to visit the Crimea: Mineconom Development, Mintrans RF, Minculture, MID, MES, FSB, FTS, Rosturism to prepare proposals for the creation of an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - around €200 million annually goes to the European States ' treasury for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Development of Russia prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe on amendments to the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on yachts imported and other means of navigation for rest and sports.
In the Ministry ' s view, this would certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Laškina noted.
The matter was put before the Subcommission on Customs, Tariff, Non-tariff, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development pointed out, the proposed measure for full conditional release on import is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol of the Sub-Commission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation, Mineconom Development would introduce a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with EEA member States, explained Laskina.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from customs duties includes those necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, among them are official equipment (personal computers, typewriters), test instruments, drilling equipment, wall costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the Mintrans press service, RF-Izvestiyam reported that they had issued binding orders on Kerchi seaports, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the handling and entry of small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport.
Mintrans has been given instructions to the Captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure that a simplified order is applied for the passage of small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure craft to the seaport and the withdrawal of listed ships from the seaport.
In addition, draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the border of the sea ports of the Crimea have been prepared by Mintrans.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosius, the remaining orders are in the process of being agreed upon, they were noted in the department ' s press service.
According to Mintrans, the Stateden, Classification and Inspection, State registration for small craft used for non-commercial purposes is to be done by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it's extremely difficult to have a yachting because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there's a whole growing industry that's involved a lot of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is on the spot.
Our shoreline is a small, single piece of yachts that can be used year-round, which is the Black Sea in the Sochi area, Helendzik, Norossiyska, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area the very strict rules of the border service: to go out the yacht, you need to form a mass of permits.
In Russia, too, the yacht can't even get started.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem is where to take it, says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special yacht hangars up to 30 m. yachts are also being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but as the crisis began, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for financial sector development.
This was reported by the press service of an international organization.
New financing will support a number of priority actions to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine - as stated in the communication.
The World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Ziyao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help re-establish credit in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Previously, the Polish Government has approved a loan of €100 million from Ukraine, transmitted to RIA News*
In prisons, separate units for transgenders are requested.
On the Public Council of the Federal Prison Service (FSEN) for the Protection of the Rights of Prisoners in October 2015, other issues will discuss the possibility of separate units for transgenders and transvestites in the colonies.
He told a council member, Vladislav Grib.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons not identified with sex in the Russian Federation, it was possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if such offenders were numerous) in the future to establish a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is not possible to determine whether citizens should be serving sentences in isolated places after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations that prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
He said that the proposed practice was successful abroad: in SIZO (where accused are before a court decision) separate cells were available for transgenders and in correctional facilities special units.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
They need to be isolated clearly, as the presence of transvestites and transgenders in the ordinary cells is dangerous to them, and this is a suffering for their families and for the sea of problems for FSEIN staff.
The humiliation of the transs is guaranteed by the cellers, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city is, how many criminals with uncertain genders are, we need to figure out where to distribute them.
SIDs don't really need any of them - just cells, jail blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if the transgenders are large.
As Grib explained, 50 or 100 persons could be held in the unit, and if the specialized body were to be established alone in Russia, prisoners of transsexuals could be served there from any region.
Citizens are detained in SIZO at the scene of the crime, so the admission of transvestites or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, and the introduction of this practice for those already convicted in a separate colony is considered by Grib.
It will be recalled that on the previous day, law enforcement officials had not been able to determine whether the detention facility, male or female, had identified the detainee for possession of drugs of 24-year-old transsexual Dmitri Kojukov (known as Alina Davis), causing the man with a maiden to be arrested.
He was released home under the signature of a non-departure.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, since there is no mechanism for transgender content in SISOs and colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, the LGBT activist (LGBT lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeiev supported the idea of setting up special places to be punished by transgenders, noting that it is also possible to define people abroad in a colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yeah, that's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as is the question of safety in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeiev.
Prisons must be safe, so individual units could be made in the name of homosexuals, especially since there are more men in prison than transgenders.
In doing so, Alexeiev doubts that Russia will have many citizens who are willing to extradite themselves for trans-sexwalls in order to get to a different place from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a transgender colony, but not always everything is clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning’s inmates looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change the floor, says Alexei.
A man can feel anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgenders to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and avoid the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could seriously delay the start of the sentence for convicted persons.
A commission is created as a matter of sexology, psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, and this is not the only test on which a high-level opinion is based.
Today's mental opportunities allow.
Therefore, in the face of gender changes, potential patients always go through these kinds of tests -- they show exactly whether gender change with surgical intervention is necessary, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system should be applied to convicted persons, since on average, it takes a month for such an examination.
The doctor, while generally supporting the establishment of separate units for transsexuals, also doubted that, in the current economic environment, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, and transgenders in Russia.
It's hard to think that there's no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such deviations and commit crimes are few, Lordkipanidze said.
Now, on an application by the authorities, homosexuals, transgenders can obtain separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipas won the world's junior chess champion.
Hunta Mansysk has completed the Junior Chess World Cup until the age of 20.
The end of the pre-eminence was given to more than an intriguing one.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and a Russian named Michael Antipas, who was able to finally chase down the Pole of Jan Kshishchtf Dudu, who seemed to be a sure title.
The girls enjoyed the victory by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The Chess World Cup, held in Hunty Mansysk from early September to the middle of the tournament, seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan Kshichtoff Douda, who issued a series of four victories (in the Swiss system in 13 rounds), was sure to take over leadership.
Given that Douda was the first-come, and was generally regarded as one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would lose the hole was very small.
And even when Duda lost his hideout and allowed the Russianman Michael Antipasov to cut the lag to 0.5 points, he remained clearly a favorite in the title struggle.
Because Antipasov had to win the 13th round in order to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, you win your party.
Plus this requirement of winning, of course, could have affected the game of Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipas managed to avoid them.
He was confident with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for his party to complete Douda, who met Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately, for Antipas, a Polish chess player made a fight with a Dutch man who was a Dutch man.
So Antipas and Doudas had an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipas had the best extras.
That is why he is the leader of the Hunty Mansium Autonomous District, the governor of which Natalia Komarov has traditionally given great attention to the development of chess in the region, and has been awarded a major prize.
But there was no intriguing ending in the competition of girls.
The leader of the tournament - Natalé Buxé (Ukraine) - had enough to win the title not to lose in the last round, which she had done with success.
So, Russia's victory by Aline Beavol prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second one, with a 0.5-point champion lag.
The output changes the regional structure.

Prosprodnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King's snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam highway was fined 50,000 roubles and the facility on the Greater Tull Street closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations had been corrected.
43 snacks violated the requirements for the facility.
Among other violations, poor sanitary and sanitary maintenance, failure to comply with ventilation requirements, were found in some facilities to have a gut stick bacterium.
The franchise on Burger King is owned by O.O.-Burger Russ, the owner of the network, Sholadnik, Alexander Kolobowa, and there are 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the department was against indexing 10 per cent of the tariffs for freight and for the provision of State subsidies, as requested by the UAO RZD.
First they wanted 17 per cent of the indexation, now they wanted 10 per cent and multi-billion dollar budget subsidies, he said.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, soccer teams, own TV, stop spending on the left and the right.
He added that FAS has its own much more stringent proposals, which are currently being discussed in the Government.

In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has up to 3 October to implement the option or to demand payment.
The details of the negotiations at Polymetallic do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal Project-Kisil in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CBS, was developing the order in which the builders were to be sanitized.
“We realize that this is nowhere to go, so we are developing the mechanism,” said the official.

The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevic, was the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third draft is a final version of the film.
Minpromtorgue: targeted food aid will not be the same as cards in the Soviet Union.
The Russian Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade, Victor Euthukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be akin to the food distribution card system existing in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid for the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I beg you not to speculate on the word \"food card\" -
I should like to point out in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product maps with the voice of the past total deficit, a distribution card system where the quantity of products received is normal.
We have as long proposed the concept, if approved, of proposing legislative changes - brings to TASS the words of Mr. Euthukhov.
Previously, I had written that a food card programme for the poor had been introduced into the Government.
For more information on the Minpromtorga initiative, read in the material \" Igor Schvaliv has commissioned the preparation of food cards \"

The president of R.D. Alexander Bobrushov is leaving his post.
The Vice-President of the U.A. - Russian Railways - (U.S.C.) on Corporate Security, Alexander Bobrushov, leaves the company, reports Interfax referring to the source.
Vice-Premier of Russia, President of the Board of Directors of the RCD, Arcadey Dvorković, stated that the issue of the departure from the RCD of Alexander Bobrushov had initiated a new head of the company, Oleg Belosaurs.
According to the vice-premier, the staff changes in the management of the RCD are not related to the change of the head of the company.
In the past, it was reported that Vladimir Yakonin OAO RZD had been headed instead by the first Peterburg Minister of Transport, Oleg Belloser, who was curing the financial bloc.
The new head of company announced monopoly reforms for the first time: in a year and a half, a new freight tariff system will be established.
For more details on the changes to the company, read in the material “I can’t help but write over the price figures ”
This year, a study of the Russian Managers' Association - Top-1000 Russian Managers - comes out on the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-echelon managers, the study provides an overview of the work of Russian administrators in a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's laureates.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as the candidate for this year ' s rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the initial rosters is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies who would be usefully added to the pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following business managers: Finance Director, Director of Business, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and given the opportunity to present his/her management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on a sectoral basis is based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Commercial Banks, Forestry and Forestry Industry, Engineering, Media, Metallurgy, Multispecial Holdings, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, Consumer Services and Production, Insurance, Construction, Trade, Transport, Finance, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industry, Energy and Fuel Complex.
Each participant is provided with a logo and a password for entry into the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the rest of the participants and can submit their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional channel.
The rating methodology is based on the principle that “Best selects best - top managers evaluate top managers, and functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle provides the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating shall be approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All interested candidates for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for previous years are invited to attend the expert commission meetings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a board to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve the functional leaders.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the online assessment and are confidential prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the attached roster of stand-by candidates.
Companies' names are given in accordance with the rules of Russian and the rules of the Russian language - I guess -
At the time of publication, the rating could change the status of managers and companies.
Investment comfort rate is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the market for small- and medium-sized business in January-April this year is 40 per cent straight.
What do you estimate is the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 and early 2015, IUCN lending declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
25-30 per cent of the annual credit was of no benefit to anyone.
If a bank had previously been able to place all its possible problems in an elevated rate, from delay to non-return, it is now impossible to do so: rates and so-called ones.
For a business, the current rate of IUCN credit is not convenient.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of payback.
A rate of 10-13 per cent would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How much do you estimate that business demands for credit are met?
After the decline of the CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more affordable.
However, according to our observations, customers have begun to apply for loans much less often.
First and foremost, business does not understand its prospects for development and future incomes.
Business now has the only way out: it is necessary to learn to work in a way that focuses on the economic situation in the country and the region today.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, to control the movement of money.
However, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
This ultimately enables the company to make the products more competitive and to keep the business even in a volatile economic situation.
What major trends in the IAS credit market will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The prognosis of the average rate will largely depend on the central bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical fall in the credit price for the ICB is not worth waiting for.
Inflation in the current situation was primarily a problem, which made it necessary to increase the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates are lowered.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited in both cash and economic behaviour correction options, would certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of poor loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic, and at the same time, it's quite difficult for those who're used to Cyrillic or Latin.
And so is the new CX-5 crossword, like any other model of the stamp, that is, unbelievably attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese is just by virtue of its Japanese-like nature, able to bring the country's products of rising sun to a state of complete awe.
You can give arguments in favor of machines from other countries, and a person will even in principle agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will come from the final phrase: “But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably have to love not only technology, but all the other Japanese.
Citing Bassé's move, feeding Vasabi's food, collecting cans and dressing your girlfriend -- not in kimono, of course, but in street Japanese fashion canons: soap, creatively, and very unexpectedly.
Perhaps the Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing characteristics — both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the younger the girl.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But to what extent does a new pattern of lights and rearlights change a vehicle’s face more rapidly in the traffic?
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the outward appearance is very strict.
We don't have to call the police.
Driving CX-5, one of the world's safest, can only be seen as a stale Japanese calm.
A 2.2 litres diesel engine provides a high torque with a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the engine ' s fuel consumption of 175 L.S. is only 5.9 L. The engine shall be equipped with only an automatic transmission and a full transmission.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can select the legins from the Not Cross police tape.
In the Mazda, however, every effort has been made to keep CX-5 driving away from your own accident.
In order to enhance the comfort by maintaining excellent control, the front and rear amortizers were reworked as suspensions, as well as to optimize the shape of the front bottom lever plugs.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A merchant in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's a different case if a girl hits a bathtub with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game of role-playing.
She'll have no less attention then than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved front and rear seat design, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both the long shoulders and the long legs, who has it.
Longer legs will surely appreciate that the thrusts in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expression.
The widest range of active safety systems is proposed for CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify the potential threat.
There's adaptive lighting here, and warning of derailment, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
A comfortable, minimum of speech, it holds a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are arranged in proportion to 4:2:4 - each section is fitted with a separate bearing - and increases the luggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
Japanese cartoon hero's suit is called \"kigrumi\"
Especially too bad to look pajama kigruma.
Everything's in it!
Of course you sleep.
But also to entertain little kids.
Or just walking around the street like that...
It's so great when you have the opportunity to pick -- cool clothes, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for helping me prepare the kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atom's mind.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine ' s cooperation with Russia on the construction of the Khmelnica Nuclear Power Plant.
On Wednesday, from the second attempt, the Supreme Council voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth units had been signed in 2010-2012, but the project had not yet been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law breaking up an agreement with the Russian Federation in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth units on the Khmelnica Nuclear Power Plant.
Only a second vote had been passed by the Government, with 210 deputies supported for the first time, with a minimum of 226, but then 234 members in a move to vote for the draft.
The initial project at the Soviet Union was to have four 1 GW power units with WEER-type reactors but only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on improvements led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and laws were passed by the Council in 2011-2012.
As no funds were available in Ukraine's budget, it was anticipated that building blocks would be imposed on the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
Following a coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent chilling between the two countries, Kiev began to reverse relations with Moscow in the atomic industry by refusing to cooperate on the Khmelnica Nuclear Power Plant and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship remained was the procurement of fuel from the RF for the Ukrainian current power plants (about half of the country ' s electricity generation), as the Ukrainian NAEC - Energy State would be replaced by Russian supplies.
The construction plans of the Hmelnica Nuclear Power Plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned, as early as 2014 in Kiev, for negotiations with Skoda JS.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, reported during a press conference that military means could not resolve the situation in Syria.
- No military decision - - brings AP its answer to a question concerning the military support of Syria from Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MID of the permanent members of the UNSB later this month.
- The meeting will be on Syria, he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Genstab of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that Henstab did not preclude the establishment of a military base in Syria in the future.
No such plans yet.
- But everything can be. - He told Mr. Bogdanowski.
Previously, I should say that the U.S. does not trust President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who said that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to combat the terrorist group prohibited in the Russian Federation - Islamic State -
For more information on U.S. doubts about Russian aid for Syria, read in material -- I mean -- the Russian military presence in Syria is worried about Washington --
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting between parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerazimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in South-East Ukraine.
What I know: a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations, brings to TASS the words of Mr. Herasimov.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and for the return to normal activities of our countries -
He asked whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the Norman format - or in the contact group format at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerazimov had noted that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, the policy stated that every type of dialogue was supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine to the negotiations, the ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, explained that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and the Lughan republics had in principle not yet changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but that the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission summarized the elections for the City Duma in the Municipal District by delegating 12 representative mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were made by representatives of the PRTF, who accused the election of “covering frauds” -
No opposition comments were adopted.
In addition, the parties “Communists of Russia” refused to organize a referendum to abolish fees for the repair of multi-family buildings.
The City Electoral Committee officially presented the results of the elections to the proud Lower Novgorod in the municipal electoral region.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the voters ' lists in Lower Novgorod, 746,000 in the ballot papers and 268 thousand in the ballots.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 were declared dead.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they obtained.
On the lists of One Russia, six seats in the proudly rely on Dmitri Swatkovsky, Dmitria Redovov, Vasilius Shuprovno, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Razterov and Igor Nagorny.
The sole mandate of LDPR was given to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the party.
Two PRTF mandates are allocated between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of Gosduma, Alexander Tarnayev.
Three mandates — fair Russia — are to Alexander the Great, Igor Bogdanov, and Michael Shalugin.
These candidates are now required to decide within five days whether or not they will serve as deputies in the City Duma: if the mandate is abandoned, it will move to the next Party candidate.
The Chairman, Mr. Alexander Mackayev, informed the Commission that he was putting on duty to send telegrams of Gyrinovsky and others to withdraw mandates.
At the time of approval of the election report, the representatives of the CRF reported multiple violations.
The member of the town hall with the right of deliberative vote from the CRF, Leonid Krasokutsky, proposed that the outcome of the vote should not be recognized in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, under the order of the head of administration of the Sorma district, the entrance to the administration building had been closed, where four district commissions were located.
Within a long time, neither Gos Oudma’s deputy nor the candidates themselves nor the observers were able to pass, and a resounding scandal, with the city’s front door storm, was shown on television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the Commissions with the right to a deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend.
Only when the voting was over and the district commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots did they have access to the chapter.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
- Then the chapter was corrected and interested persons could be present at all meetings - a member of the mountains was paired with Natal Andrushin ' s selection.
The Communists objected that the blocked administration building had held a member of the Assembly of Ludmila Aristus illegally for more than four hours and that an application had been sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition was also dismayed that in a number of UICs, on election day, the ballots began to be sealed at 6 to 7 o'clock in the morning, with ballot papers for an early ballot.
At the same time, the members of the Commissions with the right of deliberative vote and observers had not been notified, so they had already come to the beginning of the 8th morning elections.
Communists are confident that they could throw ballots in an uncontrollably manner in the morning hours prior to the opening of polling stations.
However, there have been no irregularities in the issuance of invalid ballots, according to Aleksandr McKeev, in the selection that have already heard more than 124 complaints on various grounds.
They did not support the members of the commission and their colleague ' s proposal from - Fair Russia - Maria Popova, through a slick, to come out with the amendments of regional legislation in order to set clearly the time for the opening of envelopes with the ballot papers of the early ballot, which then go to the urn.
“In order for you to have your own initiative, go to the CIC,” said Pope Alexander Mackayev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the PRRF, Sergei Samahin, yelled at the President, ignoring dozens of complaints and covering forgery in elections.
- You're not here at the meeting. Be careful. - The president of the election has been offended.
As a result, the protocol was almost unanimously adopted.
By 27 September, the election will have to approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the lower Novgorode sixth meeting will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to defining the outcome of the elections, the city election commission rejected the Russian Communist political party in registering an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to put two issues to the discussion of the lower-middlers: do they agree that the fees for the repair of multi-family buildings should be lifted immediately - and the tariffs on housing and utility services should be frozen by 2020 -
However, the lawyer duma Irin Maslow explained that the treatment of Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed benefit, a reduction in 2016 projections.
FedEx was reporting on the unfortunate results of the last quarter, and the huge delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the falling demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, however, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were delivered by about 2.5 per cent in advance bids 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending in the following May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to FactSet's review.
The forecast has been declining despite an average rate increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in ground freight charges for heavy or heavy goods beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the past year by reducing spending, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company worked stablely in view of weak economic conditions, particularly in production and world trade, as compared to the projected economic conditions of the economy.
The employment plans for the holidays were announced the day after the competitor ' s announcement, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about as much as they had been hired last year.
FedEx earned $692 million over the block that ended on 31 August, a 6 per cent increase over the previous year.
Share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share forecast conducted by Zacks Investment Research Survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by the Zacks were estimated to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a decline in urgent international transport, resulting in a lack of growth of the gross income in its express delivery unit.
However, the online shopping boom has dramatically improved results on FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating revenues remained largely unchanged owing to increased costs of large deliveries and self-insurance.
The expressway unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher labour costs.
Preliminary tenders, about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock market, fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, fell by 11 per cent in the year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting of the Federal Reserve Managers in a few years, this week, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will hold a 27-foot table from the Honduran red tree, deciding if it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At one end, the richly decorated two - story meeting room will be overlaid with a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank was given a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to retain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there are third, unwritten assignments: financial stability.
This third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to withdraw from the unprecedented incentive provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can deter already cautious federal system leaders from adding voluntariness by raising the base rate for federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegs, chief economist of Stiffel Nicolaus & Co.
Well, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates that have increased uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait further, she noticed.
There was no consensus on what would be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself caused fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent chance of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will not be short.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by the expectation that Federal system strategy makers would leave the stake this week,” said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
- It would be a surprise if the Federal System raised the stakes at that point in time - he noticed.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, it will take a long way to adopt its strategy to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic —
Other experts objected that the increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, since it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first little ball in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of U.S. recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was awaiting a higher rate this year, despite complaints by liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage increases show signs of acceleration.
Although inflation continued to be lower than the annual figure of 2 per cent set by the central bank, the leadership of the Federal System stated that the temporary effect of falling oil prices was a key factor.
The economy is able to cope with higher rates and needs, given the decline in the labour market,” observed Ian Sheferdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of the last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average index for industrial companies dropped to 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy might impede world growth.
The market partially recovered its positions this month, and the Dow Jones Index is now about 10 per cent below the Mayan value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment further complicates the difficult calculation of the period of interest rate increases.
- In the absence of information on what had happened in the financial markets and on the weak Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have begun to twist hooks at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve System staff.
Now he expects them to wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty about the consequences for the American economy, and they have little or no reliable evidence since the latest events in China” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in those decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Just a hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could be deadened -- its money expansion -- was a shock to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly interwoven, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process — more art than science — was noted by Zakari Carabel, head of Entvestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been instances of excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not appear to be related to economic principles”
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, insisted on a higher rate, cited the decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has resulted in the federal system reducing its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings — despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the United States — Laker said.
One year later, the leaders of the Federal System reversed these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should be placed at the forefront of the concern for stability only in times of great crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Interest Rate Committee in Bank of England.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
- Of course, you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of a rise in rates because of the shock in the markets. - said Posen, President of the Peterson World Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserves Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I do not think that they should go ahead of the events.
Need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
Market/commodity opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Commonly known as the Costco of Thailand, LAX-C is the wholesale Thai market, which also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
The market/commodity is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying choice of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen varieties, furniture, religious and holiday ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy the oil for the engine.
The ogroman store, and it'll take more than an hour to get through all the rows.
If you're starving, buy food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The retailer’s office in the store (good and inexpensive) is close to the cashier and offers various options for disposal.
What's suggested: Do you need anything, Thai?
LAX-C probably has that.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes soft-flavored Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat store is diverse, like the fish staff at the catch will clean up and split up the fish, and even burn it for you if you want.
An excellent part of the store is placed under an impressive ice cream section, where you find frozen leaves of carri, bitter sticks and galangal, ducks of whole, fish, beef and yolks, pig carcasses, eggs, local sausage, semi-farms, and much more.
Those who buy there are the owners and chiefs of restaurants, as well as families and individual buyers.
Shop carts and forklifts are also located in the broad passage.
Finding: A fresh fool of the moon next to the exit.
Where it is located: The magasin is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of China’s neighbourhood and the city’s business center, several blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site that it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually hard to find.
The Speaker of the Gosdoums, Sergei Narishkin, suggests that the United States deliberately destabilizes the Middle East to allow refugee waves to flow to Europe.
As expressed by Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspirological theories, but the question is in itself whether Europe is the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic tenacity in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East.” He asked.
“There must have been someone who suspected and knew that the flow of refugees, those unfortunate and disadvantaged people who had been saved from death, would flock to the EU’s well-being countries,” he added.
Naishkin asked: “Did the political leaders of Europe openly state the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which now literally engulfs their countries?”
- No, old Europe, with very few exceptions, prefers to keep quiet. - He said.
In Narishkin ' s view, NATO is flouting many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at and looked at the way in which the military saplings, which are sewn according to NATO standards, are growing up with moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and rules of international law” emphasized the Speaker.
Insurgency, mainly from Islamists, has been opposed by the Government forces and their loyal paramilitary groups.
Later, the terrorist group - Islamic State - prohibited in Russia - joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States supports rebels who fight both Asadu and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The president of Syria described the reason for the opposition to Russia in the West.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign States.
This was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, -- Russia 24 -- NTV, -- Russia today -- TASS, Interfax -- and Russian newspaper --
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the western media with the turn in Ukraine.
He said that for them, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin had turned from friend West to enemy, king, dictator, who was suppressing Russian opposition, which had come to power in a non-democracy, even though he had been elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Asad to fight against the Islamic State -
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Asad himself should leave, he noted that the President was taking power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay — the President stays, otherwise he should leave immediately — he stressed.
Asad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that they were being cooperated with.
Also, Syria is fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economics and military affairs.
He refuted the allegations that Iranian military units were being deployed to Syria.
Tehran is supplying military equipment.
There was, of course, an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but the exchange had always taken place, he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperating with any of them, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igial coalition known to the United States,” Asad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, with 11.5 million refugees.
A part of the territory is occupied by a terrorist group - the Islamic State - prohibited in Russia.
An international coalition headed by the United States is struck by an air impact on its position.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone call with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the John Kirby State Department.
It is noted that the subject of the interview was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide additional details.
He also stated that the US has instruments for Russia's best isolation - if it supports Syria's President Bashar Assad, he hands RIA News.
As reported by the Russian MID, Lavrov, during a conversation with Kerry, reiterated the need to establish a unified front against terrorist groups operating in the territory of that country.
Ways were also discussed to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, and possible steps could be taken to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Previously, U.S. officials claimed that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow's support for Assad.
In Washington, D.C., stated that if Russia continued to support Asad, it would be more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitri Peskov, a press secretary, said that the country would not be excluded from international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
A part of the territory is occupied by a terrorist organization, the Islamic State . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The International Coalition, headed by the US, has been exposed to IG air strikes.
He named the U.S. newspaper a slanderer on Arrowkov.
The former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Boroda, refuted the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
In a telephone interview to correspondent, Lenti.ru --
The Washington Post note is beautiful because it's completely out there.
Igor Strelkov, former DNR Minister of Defence, of course, did not bind and -- he was leaving -- he was in very high mood from the Republics of Donbassa, without ropes, without the three furs of money attributed to him by different characters -- he noted.
According to Borody, the story of Sagittarius in conversation with a reporter in the U.S. paper really went.
Yeah, I told you that Sagittarius was urgently required to remove the People's Republic of Donetsk, a former head of the DNR government.
Borody stressed that he did not know why an American correspondent had decided to write that Sagittarius had been taken to Russian territory.
I suspect it's provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's an amazingly misunderstood word, because I've stressed that the Sagittarius was leaving alone -- there's Borody.
- That's slander against me, and on Arrowcow, he made it.
Previously, an article on The Washington Post cited Borody’s words that he had taken Sagittarius to Russia by force.
According to the publication, Borody noted that he had to tie up his companion.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish lumberers started cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where a Third Reich gold train was reportedly located.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, reporting to Reuters.
Military experts said that the forest must be cleared in order to verify the accuracy of the rumours of the railway stock with treasures.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals inside the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lownessile Voyage, Tomas Smolarsch (Tomasz Smolarz), suggested that new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to surround the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Culture, Petr Jokhowski, stated that the 99 per cent local cemeteryrs had found the third Reich gold train referred to in legend.
Jokhowski pointed out that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were discovered, they would become the property of the State treasury, and the treasures would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two law firm clients approached the authorities of the Polish city of Walbjih with a report that they had found a train in an enclosed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The RF-General's narcolog offered to ban the sale of tobacco to individuals until the age of 21.
Russia’s chief drug addict proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugeny Brün noted that until this age - any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful -
Thus he said on live radio - Govorit Moscow - commenting that Speaker Sovfed Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
The man is growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for that.
He's mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
“ It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, only matures by 21 years,” Brun noted.
Formerly, a member of the Public Chamber and project manager - Three Russia - Sultan Hamzaev informed - India - that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age price of the sale of alcohol and agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again on the site of the upper house of Parliament -
According to the activist, a working group to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko will soon be established in the Council of the Federation.
The Bible has been requested to verify compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to verify the Bible's compliance with the federal law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development, and Cib.fm received a statement on 16 September.
The author stated that on August 26, 2015, he had purchased a Bible in the Chitai Town Shop on the Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violate FZ - On protecting children from information that is harmful to their health and development -
On 16 September, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Novosibirska accepted the application.
The inhabitants of Novosibirsk will receive a response within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It was much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, and he commented to Cib.fm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that society will bring about.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which it did not do before.
Brazilian Pediatrics Union Rio Grande promotes healthy eating for breast-feeding
SPRS, a Brazilian paediatric organization, has come up with a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves displaying images of babies suckling their breasts with images of harmful food.
Breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Owing to the high energy needs of pregnant women and women who have given birth, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor of Bailor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents their development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the adverse effects of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system have been detected.
Under Hamburg, the train ran a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus, which was stuck on a railway track.
A 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move away from the tracks, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a clash in front of them.
One of the students took him to the video.
The emergency caused panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and flee along the border.
The route still remains blocked.
According to the police, no one was injured, except one passenger of the train, who was slightly injured.
Disaster damage was estimated at €300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for the ban on boxing in the country after the death of the local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a connection with the Filipino man Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali nocaut in the 12th round.
Brown went to a hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to the life-saving equipment.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and completed one battle.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of Australian boxers flying in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Breidon Smith, died from injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends that the sport should not be allowed, but rather that it be banned.
I realize it's not going on purposely,” said the Vice-President of Stephen Parnis.
But in the form that boxing is now in, there will always be situations where an athlete gets bleeding or brain trauma, leading either to death or to severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to abolish sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narishkin, called sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He spoke on this at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable action, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the members of the OSCE PA to re-establish the Russian-EU partnership.
Let's get morals back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“Twelveness never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian Gosdum called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on Assembly members to concentrate on the following specific security challenges.
“First, in order to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and to convene our inter-parliamentary group immediately,” said Nariškin.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to OSCE.
- It's almost the only common ground where we still discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine - it's a politician.
We recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar, and will continue until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple or three days.
World champion Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be described as a triumphal one for a 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkowa.
He was able to win a record at his crown distance of 110 metres with barriers at the command stage of Europe, and the most important thing was to become a world champion, the first in the history of the domestic barrier front.
In addition, the athlete has recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, with a total of three seats.
New News asked Shubenkov to share the experiences of the season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to go to the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'll think about my rest.
True, getting ready right now is going to be at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different condition.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, beginning September, is a good time.
Passion after the main start of the discharge season, the burden of responsibility will no longer be incurred.
You can mate in pleasure, in relaxation...
Plus, you know what vacation's about to happen...
Do you have fatigue?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
The tiredness at the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what I did more -- winning or winning.
Every competition is a stress.
Constant overflights, overflows, all of this isn't going on for the body any more.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, I have emotions on the rise.
I'm just happy!
By the time you were in the Beijing World Cup, are you going back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that the bad sportsman who lives through the old victories is running his successful runs over and over again.
Enjoyed winning a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from those of the common season?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing as early as December, but I missed the winter season.
Training was first at Barnaul, then at the assemblies, then back home.
It's as usual.
But with the coach, they set the goal of trying to get to a new level that I wasn't at yet.
Most of the winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of sneakers, made exercises for general physical training, which included both pulling and sitting, and we rolled our backs.
Then they took up the barrier training, they did a lot of engineering.
Did the rivals follow the way they speak?
I'm always trying to do that, there's no problem with the Internet.
Looked at Europe's winter champion, and there the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier!
I thought you might have to do something, take it apart.
Every time you started this season, you added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons going along roughly the same pattern.
There's no way I run 13.20 first and then 13.50.
I'm always going to do my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is get out of 13 seconds.
All work focused primarily on this outcome.
But the paradox is, you feel like you're ready for a feat, and the competition isn't always going to show that you're willing to do it.
How was it, for example, on the Olympics in London?
I'm, frankly, that semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't get into the finals).
I was ready for a very good time. I really could have escaped in 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best performance at that time, I would be a bronze prize game.
But it wasn't.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get to the final, it was a math program like that.
And he fell right off the morning, in the pre-runs.
Then I realized that breaking your head and keeping your head open means that you can't run anywhere.
Two years later, the Moscow World Cup ended with a better time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive run: I really wanted to win the gold game then!
How does developing a decent speed keep your head down?
That's the hardest part.
We need to be very careful, focused on the technology, so that the barriers don't go down.
I noticed that when you're not focused on the outcome, it's much easier to process.
And the best thing is when you feel like you're running and everything's like it's happening!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes seek to move closer to the capital after their first major achievements.
Never thought that way?
Home is still better.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
How long have you been together with Clevsov?
It's been 12 years since I came to a light athlete.
More precisely, first I practiced with his wife, who was working with children, and then she passed on to me.
I started off with a sprint, then I jumped into the length, triple.
The child's mulberry was when the ball was cut, jumped in length from place to place...
At 14th, I tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
On the first run, the second adult standard was met.
That's what I'm staying for.
Fear of barriers has never occurred?
I mean, it's sort of been a deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work to do on technology.
There's a lot of torture on the outside!
But there's nowhere to go from this routine.
The technician has to get out of here all the time, so I can wake up at night, and I'm up and running through the barriers.
Anyone who has seen your run in Beijing claims it was a very nice run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't review my run, but I couldn't keep up here.
But effectiveness needs to be done further - no limits of excellence.
Don't you be afraid that a year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
I will try to meet expectations, as they say.
Once you've chosen this road, you've got to go to the end.
My coach likes to say that if you're not weak, no extra cargo should be felt.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to an interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are pissed off, I know their bread isn't feed-- give it to the enemy.
Although I didn't use my flag, and the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and I didn't directly call anyone, I'm a different piece of work.
All my pseudo-friends washed away, got out of here in a second.
The presing that I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, which I've seen types of brandy, think that white people have eaten up.
Like walking, walking, being attacked by a crowd and muting with rods.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm gonna hit a howling, old I'm, guys, scared.
There's no support for another.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so you'll bite.
Only fools can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather a better journalist, a poor job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in harsh form:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what annexia is called.
I think the reference to the way that the shriveled Shrivell has tried to sign something is in no way fit into the overall picture of the human dormitories.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his house...
The Kremlin war went out, and it's only going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started off by calling some Kremlin son of a bitch.
I have an idea who it might have been...
Cobzon's not that much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, put down a monument for him.
Of course, the people remembered him as the offending family.
Now, reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimir.
Sunrise Seven is ranking despite the ninth attempt to highlight leaders' losing to Today Show
Carl Stefanović and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the implications of the Liberal Party's announcement of the release of the leader's seat.
The ninth show was broadcast in the morning from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott was defeated.
The competitor, Sunrise, with David Koh and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcasting series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
The torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian television viewers, with the Sunrise audience accounting for 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities today, compared with an audience of 339,000.
Today, the rating was slightly higher than that of Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been reducing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared with 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 today.
It's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are more influential than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The big news for the Seventh was the amazing 800 Words debut with the former star series Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
The new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without the star Ratters Rebecca Gibbney.
The result of last night is a loud answer - yes -
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the seventh night, the luck and failure of Chase Australia was mixed.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Kifie brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) reached 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat by Eddie McGware (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia collected 520,000 spectators and the second half an hour suppressing 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
Case Australia's falling ratings for the second night will cause Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate 5.30 p.m.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, who couldn't win McGuyre's show.

The three finalists are unanimous in saying, \"The bachelor is Sam Wood, the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret closed?
Lana Jevon-Fellose, Sarah Mackay and Snejan Marcoski may have accidentally given us the idea of who would win the Holocaust.
The woman with whom Sam Wood, at last, will be left at the Locust, is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three final girls, of course, remain silent about who got the last cut.
But when we met with Sarah Mackay, Snowden Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellose on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they might have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood is persistently silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday
All three women come to a lyrical mood, explaining why Wood is the ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, and cheerfulness as the reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But by their answers to the question, \"If it is not for you, who should get the last cut of Wood, they could have been reluctant to tell which one of them really had won the heart of Philly.\"
Jevons-Fellose and Marcoschi have in no doubt called Mackay the perfect pair for Wood.
A good relationship has been established between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
- From the moment I became a member, I felt Sam's energy (Sari) and energy, and I realized that they were very good at each other, and throughout the show, I didn't doubt it.
Sarah's a very open man, she's very easy and fun, and Markoschi added.
I saw them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna be a great couple.
McKay himself said that as a result of last week's home visits, she realized that Wood may be the man she is.
- As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart - she tells me.
To the question of who should be chosen by Voodoo if not by her, she responded mysteriously.
- I don't know if I can talk about it.
I like both girls the same, and Snowden and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows Wednesdays at 19.30 on the Ten Channel.

Jarrid Hain had several career options in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested after they moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent out requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems that this was a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayn on a bench of spares for the rest of the game after losing the ball that a former Australian rugby league player had allowed on his first return to the pan in a 20-3 victory game.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayn another opportunity to return the pant and also played the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula's been on the good side, after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of having newcomers spread in the presence of a team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter of the 49ers Club, Cam Inman, reported that Hein had also received support from the coordinator of the Special Teams, Thomas Macgoy, who suggested that he forget the ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the pan by the command Minnesot Waikings at the first quarter.
For this beginning, the NHL's debut and its numerous Australian worshipers clearly did not expect it.
It was seen as Hein raced out of the field after losing the ball, and later he told the lead show Hamish and Andy at 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
- That happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything.
Hein compared his miss to the 2007 Origin series debut when a ball drop in its credit zone brought an attempt at Queensland.
This experience eventually proved very useful to a 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture with the Australian flag and the fans after the game and took the picture to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Michael Hodorkowski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkowski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
There were clashes of migrants with the police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which had developed into a clash with law enforcement personnel.
As a result, Hungarian police have used water and tear gas, transmitting Reuters.
Migrants stone the police and try to remove the fence on the border.
Support was directed to the scene of clashes, and police were responding to the aggression of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses on the route to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reported Bi-bi-si
The country ' s authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provided for the army ' s participation in the protection of State borders, criminal proceedings for those who crossed the border illegally, and an accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, so he would be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider, as soon as possible, handing over border protection functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire of 175 kilometres on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to having committed the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
A Russian man accused of stealing over 160 million credit card numbers from the US ' s largest cyberattacker, Vladimir Dinkman, reports Reuters.
During the trial, the New Jersey Dinkman Federal Court admitted to collusion in order to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian citizen described the collusion with three Russian citizens and Ukrainian citizens who were accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Responsors such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security” said U.S. attorney Paul Fishman.
Dinkmana faces 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million dollars' fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confession of the Russian citizen and may reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smileintz, was taken into custody.
The last of his crimes is denial of his guilt.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, supported by Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, warned that Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks aggravating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition — as stated in a message published on the United States Department of State website.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the faction of the Islamic State -- the activities of which are prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court -- with a coalition of more than 60 States.
Asad, the Secretary of State says, will never be able to be a reliable member of the coalition.
Also, during a telephone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if they did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is carrying out the anti-Islamic State anti-terrorist operation -
Recently, the media have frequently reported the presence of Russian troops in Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped Syrians to develop technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, as stated by the official representative on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandea, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital city.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some throwing stones, some incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is unclear why the rubber bullets that are known to be lethal, but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have produced such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, lowland part of Nepal, where representatives of the Madezi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new Constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among the Taru people who wish to have their state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, beginning with 10 persons
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sa'ansk plans to create a business of 900 jobs.
Sajansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as the centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sajansk was headed by a new mayor, Oleg Borowski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he briefed the correspondent - Regional -
Oleg Valerjevic, where did you start your job as mayor?
First of all, I learned about the results of the financial and financial audit, and I initiated independent audit of local budget expenditures.
A municipal property audit was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of document management to five days.
Previously, the authorities could walk for months.
Income base and cost optimization activities have been developed.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayyance, where the socio-economic development of the Territory was addressed.
There was no project design document (PPA) in the city.
Without that, Sa'ansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the POJA on roads, kindergarten, northern sewerage and plumbing.
Road work is already under way on two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayyance.
No such positive demographics have occurred in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of child-care spaces is one of the most pressing today.
From 1 September, the major renovation of kindergarten No. 10 for 320 sites was closed.
Estimated cost of repairs - 86 million roubles.
No such equipment has ever been available to the city.
Last year, kindergarten No. 23 was opened and 200 children are now attending.
The repairs were made under conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been found, and the People ' s Initiatives programme has also helped
There are plans to start a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the number of children between the ages of 18 and 3 years.
There are no queues for children from three to seven years of age.
Investors show interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that building in the city should be primarily done by the Sa'an enterprises, which should be provided with employment.
As early as October, a 60-storey orphan home in the Leningrad district is in operation.
With regard to construction, I add that Sa'ansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which has entered the Eco-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 units will begin shortly.
In total, we announced that 10,000 square metres of housing wanted to participate in the programme.
One condition - accommodation should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a key-to-key section -
If we can handle the amounts assigned, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In due course, the Sajana Swinocomplex was built on the Territory, and was sold for a priceless sale in 2004.
We're working with the Public Prosecutor's Office to challenge this deal.
Especially because the land is under federal ownership.
Work is under way with Moscow and the transfer of 88 ha to the regional property is being decided and the transfer of land to the municipality is being carried out.
There's a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the 1.5 billion rouble project.
We'll have 900 jobs with a pig complex, which will be a big help to the city.
Sayancek has developed a social partnership institute?
We have about 140 socio-economic partnership treaties.
A number of projects have been successful because of the active social position of business representatives.
Substantial support is being provided by enterprises such as ZAO-East Centr-Novo-Ziminskaya TEC, OO-Sayan Broler-OOO-PC MDF, which respond to all requests from these enterprises.
Directly to the City of OOO-Sayan Broler, he gave the city a gift from the town of children's towns, East Central, and he repaired a horsehouse with specialists working with children with mortgages, costing more than 1 million roubles.
Sponsored funds have resulted in the improvement of the area of the city ' s CPA.
Sponsors helped to celebrate City Day with beauty.
Like the good old times, there was a parade involving urban groups and organizations.
A city leaflet, a book of Sa'an poets, was released.
The prime workers and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sa'anska are engaged in anniversary medals.
It also participates in a municipal charity fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800,000 roubles are aimed at supporting talented children, assisting children in need of expensive treatment to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayinsca?
The city lacks doctors and subject teachers.
Housing was essential to address the issue of human resources.
Over the past year, we have provided five doctoral apartments, and four teachers have been placed in the service room.
We have a housing programme with an opportunity to privatize it in five years.
Plans are to restructure the building, where eight more teachers' apartments will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the “Living for the Russian Family” programme.
In the long term, the construction of a house for budget workers.
The most important thing is that there's a working team in town that I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw correct conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sa'ansk and our region have a great potential.
The Duma introduced a bill on price indices.
The State party has introduced a bill to index social pensions annually, effective 1 February, taking into account rising prices.
The author of the document, a member of the Parliament, the Fair Russian Federation, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyans, also proposes to conduct additional indexing of pensions on 1 April if the rate of increase in the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices of goods and services.
Indication of pensions, according to the legislation in force, has been carried out annually since 1 April, taking into account the rate of increase in the pensioner's living minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law entered into the lower chamber provided for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
However, the first indexation is carried out on 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The OSCE head of PA told Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, the Federation of Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Kanerva, stated that sanctions should not be imposed on legislators participating in the events of the Assembly.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation to the OSCE PA autumn session in Ulaanbaatar by Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, signatures from European parliamentarians, including France, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected in support of the Kanerwa position.
“A strong enough support has come into being,” said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures of deputies who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, said Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise the problem to the level of the EU’s governing structures and to send a petition on the ground -
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of Green Cape is 60 per cent
The broad front of the low pressure area, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands, is likely to turn 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported the United States National Center for Hurricanes on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure area around the middle of the Green Cape and the Little Antilles also has a 60 per cent chance of developing a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports Mayan synoptics.
Google is launching a halves campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a halves campaign designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that assist European-speaking refugees who flee war-torn and lunch-ridden countries.
Google has used a non-characteristic personal approach, annotating the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by a manager, Google employee Rita Masud, who was running with a family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“ We reached out on questionable trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Contributions will be made to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: - Physicians Without Borders - International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which resulted in the majority of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has left over 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity can help with obesity surgery
A new study found that the benefits of post-abortion surgery may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to state that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
The mortality statistics are not immediately displayed - Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert on obesity surgery, wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery Editor column.
Obesity, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for type 2 diabetes treatment, but major studies have been made among people with Morbid Obesity with a Body Mass Index (IMT) of 35 or more.
The ITC, a measure of weighting for growth, is considered normal at the value of 18.5 to 24.9.
ITC 25 or higher shows that a person has overweight and people with ITC above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your ITC here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and arm gastrectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with low obesity.
The average value of ITC for surgical interventions fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
At the same time, ITC remains at approximately 29.
Those who had undergone surgery were treated completely with diabetes of 36 per cent and partly 28 per cent.
In the treatment group, for comparison, only 1% had a complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2% had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and - flat - LNP of cholesterol - generally better in the surgical group - the authors state.
Researchers also monitored levels of A1s hemoglobin in blood, which reflect levels of blood sugar in dynamics.
A1c hemoglobin is better kept below 7%, researchers say.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
But the best glycemic control indicators, reflected in good hemoglobin A1c levels, have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to research manager Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had performed the equal gastrectomy, the group had lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), a greater decrease in IM (7.4 to 5.1) and A1s hemoglobin (3.1 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent) and was closer to full diabetes (46.9 per cent compared to 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in relation to life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight persons in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Finix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric interventions, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than the group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with ITC under 35 interested in the procedure.
The report was very important here, since it claimed that such surgical intervention was safe in a low-MIT group, where there was no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the IMT of the patient falls between 27 and 30.
- I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously,' she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that start obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse this.
In the Customs, the robbers were removed from the house of the Shuba and 9 million roubles.
In the Métiques, the robbers attacked the people of the subsonic house and stole 9 million roubles and three women's coats from them.
It is informed by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns, through an open front door, entered a house located on Gorky Street, tied a 20-year-old son of a housekeeper and, in danger of both of them, abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
Preliminary data show that 9 million 265,000 roubles were injured, and criminal proceedings were initiated under article “Disobedience”.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will be coming to watch the FIFA World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not yet in a position to obtain a permit.
Experts believe that this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world primacy, the authorities will have to think urgently about how to accommodate all the guests in the city.
The Rosbalta interlocutors believe that the tour will result in a 10-30 per cent increase in rental of rented apartments, and will have to be overpaid after the census for the rented accommodation.
The FIFA World Cup has brought to the attention of the authorities the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written under the title, each Peterburg hotel must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of the service.
It is now clear that this will not be possible for everyone to do so: hotels are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Wadim Vladimir, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopolys.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has deceived the citizens by placing a number of stars in the advertisement.
The problem is that, now, literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that all Petersburg hotels will be occupied by fans during the pain football champions.
In the city, tourists can now count 30,000.
According to the Small Island, there are 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100-two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwichi ' s first Vice-Committee on Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have so far been classified, so many audits have been carried out by accredited companies in Petersburg.
But did any hotel order a similar procedure from regional enterprises, which is strangely unknown.
I mean, there may be more people who have been classified, but nobody knows about it.
“The last six months, the hotels were not very eager to undergo classification” admitted the director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union of the Turkish Union of Yekaterin Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season in which hotels earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which did not impose the costs of the inspection, and the procedure may involve a hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
But recently, hotel managers have stepped up and applied for classification, assured Shadsky.
The students have to make progress before 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine but also not have the right to work for the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed hotel number fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be announced next year.
This has been done to prevent prices from rising by 200-300 per cent, as is the case at the Peterburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't have to raise yourself twice or three times, but you also have to let the hotels earn.
- I think it's up to 50% growth - - explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Wadim Vladimrov is not sure that price fixing is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this goes into economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
He said: “It is better to travel without self - control.
I don't know what's going to happen to the popular low-cost hosts.
Members of the State have introduced legislation which prohibits hosts from entering homes.
It is our hope that this law will not be passed or that it will not apply to Petersburg.
- We will defend the view that hosts must be preserved - - is Nana Guatemala.
She said, however, that the Mini-Hotel owners should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State has approved the bill, Peterburg will have about 80 per cent of the hosts closed and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of North-West Leonid Garbar, there is a lack of two and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are just wanted by football fans, but there is a distortion towards four-and-five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to the situation in which, at the 80 thousandth stadium, 75,000 beads are seated -
You can fix that at the expense of mini-tels.
Their possible ban, the expert sees it as \"idiotic\" -- I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but some people can't--
If the hostel is used as a dormitories, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel to which guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Minnies run the risk of skipping the World Cup because of their intransigence.
Whole hundreds of little hotels will simply fail to classify themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be asked to work.
“Companies that can carry out this procedure are not much, so they will give up less paid orders from mini-volatiles, and choose those that travel — have noticed Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of checks passed are much higher than those of Petersburg.
The reason for the peterburg delay is also due to the permanent relocation of the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to the smooth work.
Experts believe that if there are not enough Peterburg hotels, there is likely to be a need to draw attention to regional hotels and vacation homes.
With the example of Peterburg’s 300th anniversary, a river fleet can be mobilized into the city, that is, visitors can live in cabins.
In addition, many patients have been trained to come to vehicles that will allow them to stay overnight.
- You don't have to set up enough hotels to let them go - you know, Gennady Lamshine.
Free accommodations will also be popular during football times.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be established in the city.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
“From the obvious - first to leave near the stadium -” noted Láris Bragin, an expert in the lease of the Development and Real Estates Agency.
The rental price may not return to its original level after the champion, especially in the sleeping areas.
This would be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, and she stressed.
The human qualities of citizens should not be forgotten.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that Peterburg has always been a hospitable city in which people are not just pointing their way, but can also take a mini-executory trip.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in the backyard in 1970 -- my father, my mother and two children.
They found it hard to sleep with the hotels at the time, and it was hard to sleep at the train station.
- And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep, - I remember the interviewer.
True, he added, there's no such thing in the city's inhabitants right now, calling them home could have consequences, and he's scared.
But maybe in 2018, after the failing decisions of the State, the mistakes of the hotels and governments will have to be remembered?
Zhirinovsky Slyl is the Amur region.
I was thrilled to see Zhirinsky's clown in the Gosdum today.
He did things like that when our generation was still learning to trade in newspapers and is still in excellent shape.
The subject of the statement is, as it were, an LDP protest against the election results in the Amur region —
There are no protocols, because there are no protocols, other than those signed by the electors, that appear to have no protocols.
When he raises Ivan Abram's second seat and cries out something like, \"This is the winner of the election,
And there's nothing against Rodney, and then, after a fight with the chairman, take the faction out of the conference room, and literally -- you're all with the fronts of your doves and thieves --
The press, of course, does not focus on Abram, but rather on the scandal and demarce of faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
The real Wolfović made the Amur region beautiful and elegant, together with Abramov.
For the country as a whole, it's another exit from the Gyrinsky style of Pedonki, not protesting the political party against the election results.
And the faction was formally reconfirmed, and the election, if you believe the party site and Facebook, by Ivan Abrahama, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly tearing away from the subject.
He gives the dead on Amura to bury their dead themselves, and he himself preaches against “The One of Russia — in general and in no way loyal to Rodney. ”
A fine decision not to lose a face and a real one, not a showy scandal.
Another thing is that Abraham himself is now in a strange position.
Apart from the leeway from his superiors, he had nothing to wait for, and there were no protocols available at hand.
It is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, it is for the narrow circle that he has become a formal reason to insult the esteemed champion, and what's even cooler is the Ham fall to the ER and the ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy of number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 in the only regional single-manufacture district, it may become a couple who have successfully used their own party leadership and super-distortion for the same ONF and party leadership of another.
Of course, it wouldn't be Zyrinovsky, and he should have been able to look after him respectfully.
The tramp's still growing before it.
The news was that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bath fell by nothing at all.
The only thing about Abram is that he's dead.
That's beautiful.
- It's impossible for everybody to come to Europe - - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to the violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in its speech at the opening of the Dalai Llama Centre for Ethics Studies in Oxford at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the circumstances, the interests of mankind must be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while there was admiration for that, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
“ It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe, ” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for its response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
The report on thousands of refugees - excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring about real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries - he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems - he added.
With regard to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the U.S. strong reaction had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences,' said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed the hand-delivery in the last four years
Toxicology centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have absorbed disinfection for high alcohol, according to Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Haylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Centre, children's swallowing of fluids to 12 years of age for hand disinfection at toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
Children communicate more frequently with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are sent to the relief office - López CNN told them.
He explained that some children drink disinfecting fluids specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social networks.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking disinfecting liquid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinfecting liquid with alcohol to coat their mouths to obtain a stronger drink.
Young children may be attracted to pleasant smells of disinfecting fluid.
- The kid doesn't think it's gonna hurt him - he told Lopez.
Many of the most attractant (deinflecting fluids for hands) are those that are aromatic.
There are disinfecting fluids for hands with the smell of tubers, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfecting fluid for the hands contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Young children, in particular, may only have a few sprays that cause alcohol poisoning.
- It's high-concentration alcohol - told Fox 4 in Kansas City by Dr. Stephen Thornton, the head doctor of the toxicology centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a bag of whiskey like that, but people keep these disinfections in sight for their hands, and if the kids get there, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naiji Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfecting machine at school with a tuberic scent of about four sprays, had been sent for treatment to an ambulance.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naiji was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to an ambulance station.
The doctors observed her all night in a separate baby clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, telling Ritchie.
- That was really scary. - I told CNN Ortory Scott, Naiji's mother.
That may well have been fatal to my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-drinks or disinfectants, in addition to removing disinfection fluids for their hands from the children ' s reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting fluids bind to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-grader students in northern New York agreed to poison them -- the opposite -- to the teacher through the distribution of antibacterial substances in the classroom -- according to a police report.
The teacher had a lot of allergies on hand-fed disinfectors, and she banned them from being in her classroom.
The police believe that the failed plan was a “empty conversation” and addresses the discipline of the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul, she became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Krupska regional children's library is a smug owl.
The kids who come to get some books are trying to feed them with candy.
For some generations now, the library has been in the library for 95 years.
The earliest readers of the 20th century performed loud readings, performances on Mayakovsky’s poems, literary works, and correspondences with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted for four years, and as reported in 1939 by the Young Stalin newspaper, the friendship between the Hope of Constantine Krurup and the friends of the children’s library in Barnaul became stronger.
Constantine's hope even sent her child's photo to distant Barnaul friends one day.
And when the barnaulists asked if Hope Constantine opposed the library's name, they wrote that no, they didn't.
The Scriptures have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandsons of the first - century readers have had to explain whose harsh profile adorns the barrel at the library building.
During the years of the restructuring, people often called, and they were outraged: Why is the library of children not renamed?
Let's have a library name for some good child writer, no political color!
Library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as they were.
\"Kroopskaya\" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaula, like the \"lenika\" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow - brick track.
- The wizard of a monstrous city - the favorite subject of an artist named Ola Moscow.
Ola used to be a manager in a law company, to come to work at eight, to go to five, and all the other managers were only different in their love of drawing.
And then I found an Internet announcement:
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called My Cancer Mummy - - My Mother's Cancer -
Ola made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no wonder in it if you didn't create it yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world, and makes tales.
It is traditionally believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have children reading to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, and they say, \"The Russian planet is the director of Tatian Kushweed Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- kids coming here!
I think the interest in reading comes back.
In the library lobby, there is a large exhibit with updated photo exposure.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers going to the library all over the family — mom, dad, and kids.
The library is happy that the children are becoming more and more frequent with the popes.
If a child has read the whole of Chukowski at two years of age, he needs more books that are difficult at the age of.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-old Vunderkind from issuing books from category 12+.
In order to get a book like this, the child has to bring the parents with him -- they come with them, then they come back again, and gradually, Krupsky, becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and herbs, and an appendix to the magazine Niwa, the Murzilka Subshell, 1936.
Now we are not only the conceptual space - the temple of the book - we are now open to movement, we are trying to be a special place, not a house, not a job, not a school, which explains Tatiana Kushweed.
We can come here to read, play, paint together.
We've made the playing area for the baby, the baby comes just to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they keep up with their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Often, moms and colts come in, and we are pleased that the library is placed first among all the other places where babies should come.
Tatiana Kushweed says, Modern children are like we used to love classical children's literature:
- The educational work is progressing, and much attention is being paid to the authors, who are the intergenerational link -
And when you talk about little kids, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like breaking up with their heroes.
The library is constantly producing parents ’ tracts that tell us what is happening in modern child literature, what books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Booklets are so entertaining and intriguing as adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden to print books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is limited to children.
...the library's most distant room is a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the library.
Degrees will be scrambling under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
You're dating a book of your childhood like an old friend: Hello, good that you and I don't change.
Allie's still having fun walking on the road with a yellow brick, Tol Ryzikov's tape is stealing magic matches, and Malcish-Kybalcish never told the cursed bourgeois of Military Taina, that's what he's got.
Books like passwords can be found anywhere.
There's a storage room and real book rares -- for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and herbs.
Or to lead Corolenko in a famous annex to the magazine - Niwa -
Or \"Murziliki\" for 1936.
It was time for the pages to be aged, and they were painted in a tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming of retirement and of taking on rare children's books.
But kids don't feel like that anymore, and the colors in old books aren't very bright, and the themes are... opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the commsamol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this \"Pioneer Truth\"
But it was still interesting,' says the Russ Planet, Galina Ilysov, the head of the bookguard.
Murzilka's pages are darkened from time to time.
Vasilievn's valley is taking over the bookguard all his life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in what school year Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's Quidditch champion, in what situations Carlson uses as a motor driveer, and who works for Alice Selesnow's father.
The librarian’s work is underpaid, and anyone who can live without these book lines is very quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, and ministers of the worship of the book.
They can also be learned from a smile, which is considered to be a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be fair and beautiful on the shelves, and I love to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think at my childhood, everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me.
And since I was crazyly fond of them, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope that books will always be available, despite the Riders.
And I am happy when our former readers bring in children or grandchildren...
Hearing mill: B - Seltique - no differences
Griffiths refuted her disagreements at Seltique, following Dale's admission that Hoops was in a bad position, but he'd make it better.
- Harts will protest the claim of the Scottish Football Association to Neilson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity.
♪ Dons ♪ increased the pre-Seltik ♪ up to five points ♪
Adam Rooney's Penalty in the first time gave Aberdeen a small advantage over-Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to break away from-Seltic for five points.
Griffiths refuted the controversy
This led to rumours of differences in Seltika, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering any intense criticism, preparing to meet the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for him.
Dutch aren't bored because Scottish don't have a title fight - de Bur
Former semi-protector from Rangers and former Dutch team member Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Seltika - because he did not compete for the title c - Rangers -
De Bur, now representative of Ajaksa, said: \"In Holland, the most attractive features of the game are no longer shown \"Seltica\" and why \"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here talk more than just about the return of Rangers--
They're talking about Old Company--
They talk about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
Old firm games have a lot of tension, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
- I'll change everything, - said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltik was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
The defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the League of Champions soon lost 10 football players - Aberdín - who now takes the top line of the table at five points.
But Dale said, \"U-Settle, there were bad times before, and we'll be out again\"
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's a shame, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
We too, but we need to keep going.
And indeed, we really need the support of Seltika, because that makes players much better.
Stay together now is so important.
Warberton's waiting for January transfers.
Despite views that came just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had defined some of the goals of the January transfers, the Boss Rangers, Mark Warberton, with distrust applied to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy team unity.
The former attacker, Brentford, said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.
As for the players coming in summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The Mic to ask, \"Seltik, hinted at a career end.\"
The attacking Sunsy, the Mitch tied to Seltik, during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans had ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
- Harts is going to oppose SFA about Neilson's statements.
- Harts was run with a 2:1 score when Paterson was removed and 3-2 lost, but the lawyer's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up his words, saying, \"I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game.\"
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyncasl
Hibernian's stubborn player, after acknowledging that the song was singing with offensive words about the former player, Hards, Rudy Skacela.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby in Tincasl in March 2014.
- It was a derby, and it was burning,' said the attacker, adding: \"Maybe it's safe to say that I wasn't going back to Tincasl if he didn't play for \"Seltic.\"
Donnelly: Tannadis's board is certain of management - Dandi United -
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United Board of Directors remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deteriorating situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to come out again,' said Donnelly.
McKinnes is glad he won the Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team, Aberdin, had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh victory in the front of the league, which put them on the top five points above Seltika, the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first time toolbar.
McInness said: \"There's no team here to win anything -- a cup, or a league champion, who didn't win a meeting in this way --
The level of unemployment among Scottishs does not change, while the United Kingdom as a whole is growing
THE number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than that in the United Kingdom, at 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by a quarter to 74.0 per cent - above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandela, commented on the latest figures and noted: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
During those 12 months, we saw further improvements in the situation in the Scottish labour market with increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why I am a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, while avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch people executed.
If this happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on the death row observation gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made as early as January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I became afraid.
So why do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since journalists often want more than places, the results of the grim lottery decide who will choose.
In Oklahoma, the number of press spaces dropped from 12 to 5.
Whoever chooses will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've got our own relationship with him after months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh when we talk to him.
The prison authorities claim that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I am not allowed to take a note and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma reporter accused me of being Twittered of being impartial.
That's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, getting access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could speak better, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he told me.
I told him he could pull me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international newspaper journalist there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellover, reporter at the Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into any more detail here.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip wasn't responsible.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treze make him guilty of abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'm totally objective.
There will be other reporters who can be approached.
You'll find out from me what it's like to watch the person I like die needlessly.
The man being tried was told to get out of the Canning River
Constable, from the town of Canning Veil, managed to get the man out of the Canning River and stay dry.
The resident of Perth intended to leave the police but could not, stuck in the dirty water a few metres from the police officer trying to talk him out of the shore.
The Canning Veil police were summoned on Tuesday on the illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police observed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself at Canning.
But he didn't sail far.
- He stood in the water and said, \"I won't go out, come on, grab me,\" said Sergeant Shendell Castledyne.
Constable Laklan Perchovier didn't want to wear his uniform, so he used a safer reception -- talking to a good cop --
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says senior Sergeant Castledaine.
That's what the football champion Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazins went into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and attempted to sail Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but he deceived the locals into inventing a joke-biotlon Ben Kazins--
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of horse sports.
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his last horse last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His targets were the stewards and the ethics staff of Racing Victoria, who he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the launch because of a violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of launch, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always put forth his best effort by participating in leaps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the leader's sample of cobalt, which he could not explain.
He had been speaking about suspicions of espionage for a period of one and a half years, and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
- I wasn't going to talk about it, and I've been suffering for a long time, but sometimes you're getting so out of your lap that you don't get tired anymore.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'm going home and will sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's wrong, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody made a sensational statement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll call, if they ask him, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information on what I'm doing in my stable, Mudi said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all make a statement, since the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rollston, former president of the RVL, David Moody, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Sondra, external executive director of the RVL, knew all the time and know now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's becoming personal?
Should RVL have courage and responsibility for what's going on in this business other than coaches?
How bad am I for this profession?
Is that how bad I am for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and it hurts me.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Dosada coach only grew in a long investigation of the cobalt and Ledari cases, and the last horse removal from the start made him claim that he could put his license on the table --
Moody, most famously known for preparing an invincible Black Caviar champion, described the medical requirements for use on the day of the mock game - after the horse’s leg had been damaged by clay, in violation of the rules.
It's a violation of jumping rules.
“I must be fully responsible,” he said.
One of my employees made her lose her leg by mistake.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, just like she did.
She was with him the day she ran.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of competition for the use of a compress, and the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
- We all understand that we need rules, but it's too far away.
Driver who drove and fled the accident to Kobram, arrested
The police arrested a man who crashed a motorcycle in Kobram on weekends and escaped from the scene.
The motorcyclists were taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital on a helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the wounded motorcycle.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
Coach-Melbourne Storm- Craig Bellamy is pairing up charges against rivals in the use of heavy force
Coach-Melbourne Storm - Craig Bellamy called criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as - imposing the agenda - on the part of two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Rusters - Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed - Storma - to fight - with his team during the sudden victory - Storm - in the finals of the Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
Coach Brisbane Broncos - Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on - Storm - after his team won the final qualification tournament at - Nosern Queensland Cowboys - on Saturday night, when he called this game typical - for the regby league and said that two of Queensland's teams were not too successful - in handcuff.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball with his team and said that they were simply focused on - contact - intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he had the confidence to criticize his team by two leading coaches, which meant that they were concerned about a possible defeat from -Storm -
- It's still coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about hard times when they played us at 24:2 - said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can be told that we haven't changed anything for a year in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks we've paid special attention to the ball interception contacts, which has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and for him it's been a bit of a shock.
It's funny how it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of typing football by reminding his teacher that St. George-Illavar Dregons-Bennett won the 2010 champion's football game.
Wayne talks about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night, and see how impressive their game was -- he noticed Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George, he was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wasn't cared for by any means.
But now he has a team that can show what he sees as impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors at their speed.
It's a football you want to play when you've got these players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're somewhat worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Game - Storm - and -Rusters - was a match with a large number of points than the game Broncos - and -Cauboys -
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts -- and what, that's an impressive football?
Or consider impressive interruptions and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
At the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to accept either \"Nort Queensland Cowboys\" or \"Kronall Sharps\" on the next Saturday night at the AMI Park Preliminary Finals stage, tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
The Serbian drug possession accused was released on bail of $200,000
A man facing life imprisonment for an attempt to make 40 kg of cocaine taken to Queensland by smuggling was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximović, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs in the Solai yacht, which was run by Vanuatu through South America and docked in Kumera in August.
During the whole morning, Maximović and his associates were seen on the docks, and he later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maximović faces a lifeline in an attempt to assign narcotic substances sufficient to be sold, Maquimović argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to secure the entire party and that the man could have been in a café without any intention.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, doubted that Maximović should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia a lot, he says to the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximović ' s mother and father were asked to make a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both it becomes apparent that the deposit of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them” was Judge Flanagan noted.
But one measure is insufficient as a guarantee that it will not disappear, and the judge added.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail provided that he had issued both his Australian and Serbian passport, had been observed on a daily basis by the police and respected the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m..
Photiz Katicaris: “I love the consummated Greece, which has fought until the last seconds —
The chief trainer of the Greek assembly, Photis Cacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 of the final Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game had made some mistakes.
It was a big game, which quotes Katicaris' AFP.
We were preparing for an excellent Spanish game.
They tried to work in defense, but errors in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: I will have CSA's function as Kauna.
The CSC's new man, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe the army's curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I talked to Coach Demitrys Itudies a few times this summer, and myself, after I joined the team, quoted \"P-Sport: Freeland.\" In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sashi Kaun, who left the team in both the defensive and the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to restructure to the center, but I'm in the NBA playing forward.
Now we're going to need more resistance to the big center rivals, but I've done it before, so I think I'll be able to do it now.
The army won Euroliga for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached Final four six times — but they have been unable to show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team's wrangling someone.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show you the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning Euroligus, I really think.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the CSCA year.
As for the glare, I am not a superstitious man, nor do I believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
I don't have any rituals in front of the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: \"To me the match with the Roma will be special.\"
The main coach, Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st tour of the League of Champions' party tour with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the exact separation of his present and former team would be far from personal.
Recall that Luis Henrique trained the Wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show up on the best side in Italy’s capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience.
I have a very warm memory of Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start champions in the League with a win.
The August meeting in Joan Gamper's Cup will not affect the team's actions in the near match.
I'm waiting for the Roma -- the game she showed in A v. Juventus series --
It's a strong team who can press and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Scripchenko: \"Krannodar\" has different options for attacking:
The Acting Chief Coach, Urala-Wadim Scripchenko, in the lead-up to the 9th round of the Prime League, with Crannodar, noted the diversity of the rival team's attacking schemes.
According to the mentor, ‘ bullies ’ have several models in their arsenal of games of attack.
The link will take place on 21 September, starting at 16.30 a.m. and starting at 16.30 a.m.
How do we play with Crannodar? Let's see if we can get an official website, Urala, the words Squeezechenko.
We've got a whole training week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, many attacks, but we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.

At home games, we can pick points from anyone.

Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to make pedophiles send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone, and found it in the hands of a sleeping Hogga.
She checked him and found shocking photos, and immediately turned her mother’s attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, after which they studied the computers they found at that address, and they found, as appropriate, requests in a search engine using words to detect children's indecent images.
Hogg then told the police that he did it, because it could \"bring pedophiles\" and then he would, pretend he's a cop to scare them--
The court official, Eilid Robertson, reported to the sheriff's court in Dundee: “He said it was passion, he was afraid of people.
He admitted that he had made computer requests, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and that he asked for more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a head problem when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: \"When a girl found pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw dirty images on the phone, and then the defendant had an eye rate.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used the computer and “Pleistishn” to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the bail conditions on 25 January of this year and not appearing before the court on 24 March of this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogga not be included in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, since it could be proved that the crime had not been a significant sexual element -
Sheriff Alistair Carmeikle postponed his sentence until October before receiving certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody prior to the opening of his hearings in other outstanding cases.
It was listed as having committed crimes of a sexual nature before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is not reading the same speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's senior state leader, had fallen from a podium ladder earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video on the stage of the fall spread instantly on social media.
Parliament ' s opening was also marred by statements by parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats warning them against being released by Mugabe during the course of the speech.
A month ago, they released the President when he addressed the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Member of Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonez, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The message came from a number that was not displayed, but entitled ‘Death’, he told the journalists at the end of the Mugabe’s speech.
The members of Parliament noted that they had warned that the integrity of the house of Parliament ended and, as soon as they left, the parliamentary integrity did not work.
A member of Parliament stated that a party led by Morgan Tswangirai was concerned about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its restructuring programme and to reduce service delivery costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two exchange-registered companies, separating the manufacturing of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job losses would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard Statement.
“This restructuring will ensure a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after division.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise would be less and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the portfolio of business lines would be wider and deeper, which would help the company move towards a new business style, - said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual income of over $50 billion and will be focused on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions to companies, reported to the company.
This is how a company, established in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, was formed to produce electrical equipment; their Palo Alto garage was nicknamed the place where the Silicon Valley was born -
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the world's second manufacturer of personal computers, and one of the largest U.S. technical companies -- the newest event in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies work better.
Captain Arsenala Michael Arteta says that his fellow clubmates must support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing the Dinamo Zagreb game.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September and that, provided that Wilshire's restoration was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game of Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will accurately miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European champion next summer remains at stake.
Most of all, this recent problem was that Wilshire had successfully completed the previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to revert to the habit of aggressive playing during pre-session training.
Wenger: \"This injury is not threatening his career\"
It's just not quite a hairy bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
This does not involve ankles or injuries that he had previously suffered.
It may be medically related, but as Wenger also allowed it, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries in six years from his debut.
He also played only 65 out of 157 Arsenal games in the league over the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal Wider schedule, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, beginning in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of two Prime League clubs with the most injured days.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of a fever, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of trauma statistics will continue in the last season.
“Sometimes when you return after the trauma, you have been vulnerable for some time, and you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” said Wenger.
Jack's young enough and he can handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, and I am confident that his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal is launching a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with the Dinamo-Zagreb match and will continue on Saturday with the games of Chelsea and on the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur and Wenger plans to rotate the composition.
Ector Belerin and Aaron Ramsay did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathie Debussi and Arteta will be played in the starting room.
We may also be joining Kiran Gibbs and Olive Girru to replace Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
- I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little bit of a break to the players that need it, told Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Stageximir in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
- Dinamo has not lost any of the 41 matches since they were able to hold the last season as the Invincible
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that Arsenal learned a lesson from last season, when the team was hit by the Monegasque League of Champions, and it remains with little hope to lead the club to win the final Cup of Champions.
- It's an incredible drake. - Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we don't dream.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of such stories falls into the eyes, especially considering how desperate the need of men to be frank is more than ever, with young men at most 15 years of age.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to deal with the problem of “Community Against Accidents”, she declared 2015 to be the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficient number of friends - in a normal mood - the chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the mental - healthed circle of friends doubles the risk of having a mental disorder.
But, of course, it's the first thing you need to do to make a friendship.
In an era when communication is managed by social networks, when the style is preferred to content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful communication.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fond of fun and success, even if the reality is lonely.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship - which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, a video game maker, you won't buy any more happiness for money.
Friends' dignity is that they're drawing attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not through his own work, but rather through his personality, which was manifested in communication with his friends.
Yumor Joey and the constant embrace of Chandler, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, the sighs of Ross on Rachel all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As the staff member, Samaritens, said to me, \"... my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, stresses how even the tiniest communication of friends can benefit\"
Often the men who come to us feel powerless to talk to our friends.
The old teaching of living with it is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation of problems can be taken into account as weakness --
Friends is one of the things that comes to mind when I try to suggest longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the minor points of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people at times of despair, and long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So if you visit the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you have completely restored decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Don't think in advance about the benefits of friendship.

De Maria is killing her goal, helping out the RV to crush Malmö.
Angel de Maria, on the same basis as Blaise Matüidi and Addinson Kavani, she'll celebrate the killed swords at Malmö's gate.
Angel de Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, scored a goal than allowed the PJC to go around Malmö on Tuesday.
This is the match report and the game response.
Angel de Maria and Addinson Kavani did their job when Parry Saint-Jerman started his game at the League of Champions with an extremely comfortable 2-0 vs. Malmö at the Park de Prince stage on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first League Champion game began as a SPM player, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani scored a 61-minute goal.
Along with the Real Madrid- and the Donetsk-Shakhter- in Group A, the Pari had to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they did not aim to qualify as playoffs, but to continue with a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached four-quarters.
They made points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to count Zlatana Ibrahimović as useless in the attack and later replace him with a field in a game against a team from his hometown and club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
It's not easy to win a house or a guest in the League of Champions, so winning a 2-0 score, bringing the opponents problems, and playing the defense perfectly is a good start, even if there are still moments we need to complete during the season,' said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I'm sorry we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibrahimović returned after his injury at one of the Paris team replacements, which brought her a 2:2 account in the match with Bordo in First League on weekends, but he was taken to the back of Dee Maria for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as being able to take out the SPM to a new level in Europe, after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he escaped to the post post office from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmö and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball to the far corner of the gate of Johann Willand.
However, if someone was waiting for SPM at the time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won the Plei-off Seltik to reach this stage with nine world-level players at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two support semi-protectors in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the Nikola Giurgić strike, with the ball passing past Kevin Trapp's leading pants at 34, they attacked a little bit.
However, S.S.R.M. has at times failed to do its own thing through its own unsuccessful gears and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimović, who was only unable to carry out at least five attempts in the first half and was then unable to process the ball killed by Kavani as soon as the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skilled in exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Dee Maria, had sent the ball with a twisting blow that had come in contact with Viland’s pants for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark, thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimović sent the ball to the center of the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the interception of the Viland ball from a nearby distance prevented David Luis from increasing his final score before he was replaced by Essex Lavessi, who did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Coach - Malme - Age Harade later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian explained: “Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December”
We've only played Swedish league since, and that's not the level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Gala-Pari!
It was a wonderful match with them.

More than 40 decrees and orders have been signed by Vladimir Yakshev.
More than 40 decrees and orders have been signed by the Governor of the Tumena province, Vladimir Yakoshev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal areas.
In particular, funds are being channelled for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Lower Audin district and for the major renovation of the district hospital in the Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major maintenance of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The hot and cold water, water, electricity and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, will be repaired, the buildings will be repaired, the fire-fighting and energy-saving activities will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
From 17 to 18 September, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Romanian delegation will take the lead with the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation are described by the Honorable Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Shugle, who was part of an official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what is the task of the Soccer Forum?
A large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policies of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links between the two States.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenco, are scheduled to take part in the plenary.
In plenary and sectional meetings, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, legal regulations and programmes of the Federal State will be discussed.
The Governor of the Tumen region will speak.
I believe that this indicates successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be operational.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new beneficial contracts and agreements.
I add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
A very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumena and Minski had also been signed.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumena at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial sector.
You have recently met the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tumena province, Vladimir Yakashev spoke of the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus under today's difficult conditions.
The supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed, and they will be needed to reduce the cost of end-use vehicles.
Discussions were held on issues in the Romanian trading house - Belshine - and options to prevent loss.
Important issues, as investment projects must work clearly and bring benefits to the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of UAO-MAZ passenger and cargo technology -- the development of the UAO-MAZ service centre -- which was established in Tumena at the UAO-TPAP-
The conversation also touched on the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion of the harmonization and the signing of the Agreement on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation between the Republic of Tumena and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to move forward.
The issues concerned the regional centre.
During a meeting with the chief administration of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumena Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the frankincense, so a new shipment of vehicles from Belarus will be needed to operate on gas, clean fuels.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator plant is working with a leading UAO-Mogilevliftmash elevator manufacturer, who is receiving kite.
In my view, this activity could become more active, given the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
In addition, within the framework of the consul ' s expanded powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokoriin, during which discussions were held on the issue of increased trade and the provision of modern Belarusian technology in Zaurall.
A meeting with the Omo Governor is scheduled to take place at the end of September.
The expanded Consular District includes five RF entities, but Tumen may be referred to as the district headquarters.
The region is a site for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary genconsul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they enable many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, while reducing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the goal by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is opposed to focusing on the ethnic diversity of film-making people.
Matt Damon challenged the African-American producer Effie Brown, claiming that he didn't need to take ethnic composition into account.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight show on HBO, a well-known actor beat Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroine in the scenario chosen for the project.
- It's appropriate to have a cast for the movie itself, not for the show, but for Damon.
The proud Brown, not believing in his ears, blasphemously cried \"Wow, it's nothing, but all the while a Martian actor was giving comments on live air.
Ben Affleck and Farelli's brothers joined producer colleagues to discuss the show with Damon and Brown.
- I would like participants - whatever the director - to think about what kind of treatment Harmony's image they're going to follow - - said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who's hit by a white pimp.
The film producer Dear White People advocated that film directors be Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that we could eventually get the wrong thing to do --
After this discussion was shown on television, social networking was blown up by the disapproving comments on Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni bitterly spoke of what was shown in the video: \"A clarification of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room TACOE BELOE, as if he were sick.\"
Tweet got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000-lakes-
Damon's statements appear just when the literacy of racial themes in the media is the most pressing issue in the public debate agenda.
After Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour population.
In February, the singer of the Prince referred to this movement at the time of the submission of applicants for the Albome Year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
- The albums still matter,' he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued a formal statement in response to the question posed by Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbek as to whether the group would be regarded as a hate group.
- The Black Lives Matter's a love group, they told the leaders of the movement.
Recently it was announced that Damon had been included in the list of showmakers, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope in Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met the Pope.
♪ American Ninja Warrior ♪ awards the first champion ♪
On Monday night, Isaac Caldiero, a professional plumber and assistant waiter, was the first winner of the show, American Ninja Warrior, to take home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to go through all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldiero and the operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task involved lifting a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the task, and he was the first to become an athlete in the history of \"American Ninja Warrior\" in phase 4, but Caldier was able to do the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After a victory with incredible labor, Caldiero, who was shocked that he won a million dollars, gave an interview.
It's amazing to think about it, but I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year -- I've commented on Isaac to journalists E!
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it was... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wide met with journalists - The Hollywood Reporter - to talk about the final and why Britten, who first passed the track, won't get any money prize.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
- If the financiers are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them - he told Wied.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about this.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of fan feedback.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me if someone was expected to lose, I'm glad it was Isaac.
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
Show America Ninja Warrior will be back in the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
- The desert Tigers are quietly bypassing the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers, is now the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Aiming just to be an obstacle, Taggers won brilliantly on Tuesday \"Minnesota Twins\" with an outcome of 5-4 on \"Targetfield\"
Twins missed a chance to cut back on half-games from Houston Astros and take second place in playoffs on the number of points after winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word F, which was eclipsing most of the second half of the season.
- All winning is fun, no matter how they're getting, the manager, Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Peter-Tigers-Alfredo Simon contributed to the attacks, which resulted in Detroit gaining three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a 6 1/3 inning drinker and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality launch on nine exits.
- I just want to finish the year with good performances,' said Simon.
I don't want to drop out of every game, and I want to get into the game more deeply.
The appointed beater-Tigers-Viktor Martinez was able to beat three blows and achieve two wounds, the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since the four strikes in the game against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
- He worked well with the bat,' said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of a batter), made a remarkable improvement in the performance of the bats, and maintained that quality for the game.
With three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of returning to the game.
The Central Host Byron Baxton opened an inning dam on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Heeks, made the bant, took first base, and the second Bayman Brian Dozier got a strike-out at Simon's, before left-wing Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy bypassed Moera, the only player on the road formerly reassigned by Miguel Sano, who beat up the bi-ranno-single to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
At an early couple, not in an aut and a comparable wound at the second base, VerHagen was able to bring Trevor Pluff's third beat to the back.
It was the 27th time for the leading top league player this season, when Pluff hit a ball on a pail.
After Detroit added an insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a dabble to the space between outfielders and the closing pitcher, Tigers Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, a right-handed player beat Sano up after three strikes and received his fifth safe.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was not currently in practice at the beginning of the game.
Taggers worked three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved drinker who was on the list injured until the game itself, missing more than a month in connection with the ignition of the belt.
- It's definitely not the start I'd like to -- said Hughes, \"but as the game evolves, I feel more comfortable and so I've been able to do some pretty good throws in the third inning.\"
After the first beater got to the first base, Hughes threw the single second beater, Ian Kinsler.
Wook at the two doors of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martínez finished his series at 0 for 21 with an early start in performance.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, was followed by a single wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
Taggers increased the score in the second inning by obtaining a one-out-double from James McCann's trutzer and a two-out single-single from the central beater Anthony Goose, and what became 3-0.
- It was a powerful hit,' said the manager, Twins, Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got right to the point.
Hughes, who was considered to have been thrown in the wrong points of the third inning, was then replaced by A.J. Akhter, a correct relic.
Hughes counted three wounds for six hiccups and a four-out strike.
NOTE: Peter-Right-Tigers-Anibal Sánchez left players because of the stretch of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sánchez back in 2007.
Sánchez, who has been on the watch list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sánchez, Pitcher-Lewsch, Daniel Norris will leave the list of injuries and go against - Twins -
Norris, who came out of Taggers, four-starts from the time he was acquired in exchange for the pitcher-left David Price on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to a spraining of the bone muscle.
Taggers and Twins will complete a series of three Target Field games on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43), Ervin Santana (3-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint by Kadirov on the book - Molba to God - went to the South Sakhalin Court.
In the South Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal by the representative of President Chechni Ramzan Kadyrov to the decision to recognize “extremist material” - the book “Molba to God: its significance and place in Islam - reports Interfax, referring to the President of the Mount Alexander Chuhray.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants.
Chukhray refused to comment on the allegations made by some members of the Russian Federation regarding the need to examine the bitterness of possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and IGIL.
- Let's just comment on such nonsense. - He said.
On 11 September, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor ' s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extreme material” -
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office of South-Sahalinsk received an appeal on Friday night.
In the prosecutor's office, they believe that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the Ayat (the Quran).
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision - he told Chuhray.
The decision to recognize the book as “extreme material” was adopted on August 12, 2015.
In particular, the Extremist have been quoted from the Quran - We worship you and pray for help - so do not invoke anyone with Allah.
Cadir called the decision-makers on the Shytan book and the provocations,
He called on the deputies of the State to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
I am firmly convinced that the State party must adopt a law prohibiting the adoption of judicial decisions relating specifically to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures, which was written by Kadir in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Staff members - Facebook - intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
Combating xenophobia and racism through the Facebook network is committed to working with the German Ministry of Justice.
On the eve of the day, Haiko Maas, the head of the department, said that the Minist was currently working with the Socsetti specialists to establish a special moderator group.
Participants are required to monitor and remove inappropriate comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the involuntary posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their record.
Organizations with expertise in collecting complaints of insults from the social media should also facilitate the prompt blocking of unlawful content.
Management - Facebook - intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice, had been taken since the xenophobic sentiment had risen sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious causes for them was the unprecedented migration crisis of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all sites for housing refugees are already crowded.
On the eve of the day, the authorities decided to place migrants temporarily on the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forced settlers from the Middle East and Africa are stationed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation zones will appear on Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will provide specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first would include the Butovski, Domodovsky, and the Shrbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already emerged at the Troekurov Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will be found in other parts of the city.
The portal m24.ru was described by Artem Ekimov, head of the State Budget Agency, the Ritual
Relax areas will represent small, green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that in such cemeteries, visitors to the cemetery will be able to rest, be alone and regain psychological strength.
Relaxation zones will soon be built in Domododsk, Butovsk and Shrbin Cemetery, and then elsewhere in the capital.
According to the chapter of the GBO-Ritual, when the cemetery area is to be expanded, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest masses to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants would serve as live fences that would divide rest areas and areas directly below burial grounds.
The experts of the GBO-Ritual also expressed their intention to propose the elimination of emoluments at burial sites.
New cemeteries can indeed become barless.
In addition, in the GBO-Ritual, there was a willingness to install electronic terminals that will provide visitors to the cemetery with GPS coordinates and number labels.
In June of this year, the GBO-Ritual also proposed to adjust the cost of disposal services based on the time of the year.
For example, a thousand roubles in summer will be cheap, a week in winter, when the earth is frozen.
Note that in the past year, the average rate for all ritual services has been 10 per cent.
Five days later, a stray mushroom was found in the Elnin forests.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than hundreds of hours in the forest without a permit.
A joint effort of rescuers and volunteers resulted in the detection of the HFFF.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: - A 79-year-old retiree from the Tambo region spent five days in the forest -
No food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There was even a film with dogs, but there was no result.
A man was discovered after a helicopter had joined the search engine.
That day Vitaly Alexandrović used to go to the woods to pick up monkeys and sub-farmers, but he didn't come back by the evening.
The relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day, rescuers and inequitable residents from a nearby village, about 30 people, were raised to find a mushroom.
A helicopter at the fire and rescue centre joined them for five days.
Andrei Selettekov, the head of the search and rescue unit of the Smolen province fire and rescue centre, explained: “The helicopter was engaged, the man was discovered ”
He's gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He went a great distance at his age.
The miracle's still alive.
Gribnica was taken to an Italian central district hospital without consciousness, in a very difficult state.
Doctors have diagnosed pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and refrigeration.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not represent anything at all.
Valentina Neppsch, head of the Elnin R.B.C. therapeutic department: - Patient survey, treatment -
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it remained severe, but it was positive.
The pensioner, Vitaly Alexandrović, arrives each year in Smolenjian from the Tambo region.
His grandson says he's gone to collect mushrooms before, but he's never gone far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, shared: “Less is not far from the road, but is not in principle local in itself.
For a number of years, I had come to visit relatives.
Well, I'll get some mushrooms.
Apparently, he went a long way and got lost.
Since the beginning of the mushroom season, people have been regularly lost in all regions of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, there are five similar cases.
Rescuers are reminded that they need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, sleepers, and compasses.
It is also desirable to leave behind trails so that they can return.
An emergency An-2 was on a prosque at a fraternal taiga.
An Al-2 crash right through the village in Siberia.
An emergency landing was made 68 kilometres from Brasska by a red-headed airline company, Enisi.
There are no dead or victims, but the plane itself has suffered significant damage when it landed.
An-2 made an official flight.
There were three crew members on board, a second pilot and a flight mechanic, reports Interfax.
The crash aircraft flew along the route of the Ironyrsk-Ilim-Achinsk, where the airline was based.
The crew has already arrived in Brasque.
After the Al-2 emergency landing, the Brasía Transport Prosecutor ' s Office initiated an inspection of compliance with the aviation safety legislation.
An East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Investigation Unit went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the crew of Tu-154 planted its aircraft with passengers due to technical inadequacies to the abandoned Komi safe airfield.
Engines and onboard electronics were turned down on the liner, but the crew made the impossible.
Ten crew members and 72 passengers were on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
Developments in the Economy - Nobel Laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have reduced the inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation does not seem to be the same, but rather the difference between the incomes of the population in the developing economies is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers that the Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making of NIAS, Nobel Prize winner Eric Maskin, is of the opinion.
The world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets in the last twenty years.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Supporters of globalization projected great benefits for developing economies.
- And these forecasts have happened a lot - they're Maskin's.
For example, China and India have experienced a significant growth in per capita GDP.
But it's not that nice.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the \" poor \" and \" poor \" in poor countries, which is reflected in greater income inequality and more precisely pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in her article “Why Global Markets Has Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economies — published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and cited by NEEW.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Cramer Eric Maskin of Harvard University developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income differentials in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, resembles the NEA-WEL.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin provides four levels of skills - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, professionals D from poor countries lack the skills to collaborate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if level-C workers from poor countries have increased wages because of cooperation with B employees from the rich, D-growth workers do not feel that their wages are falling at all.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to the widening of the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, to increasing inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskinim proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardon theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskers, professor of science, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, head of the Mathematics Department of the U.S.I.I.U.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it's going to lead to a surge in empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, according to the scientist, the employees themselves do not have the resources to do so and companies are not comfortable with paying for their training.
In such a situation, the role of Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations, Maskin, can play a significant role.
He noted that the theory developed in no way called for a halt to the process of globalization, which had produced and produced results in the growth of the GDP of countries.
Derbent: live communication in time.
Derbent is one of Russia's oldest cities, marking its 2,000th anniversary in September.
In the celebration programme, a festival of national cultures of the Dagestan and a fair in the past, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show for two hours, and a tour of the reconstructed Peter I museum.
Medieval stones of the Naryn Kala fortress, old Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow jars and palace gardens, all seem to have gone off the pages of the thousands and one night --
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazaranate, and the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern platinum, which grows in the courtyard of the derbent Jum meme, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russia Programme - Trees, monuments of wildlife -
The shadow of a scattered crown saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A mosque visitor is poured with aroma of tea and is given by the Dagestan locomotive — honey figs, hurmala, mushmula, sluts, arana and sweets.
In Derbent, the sparks of centuries have been used by large self-inflicted people to feed many visitors with tea at one time.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma mark says that the building was built in 115H.
That is, in 733 C.E., on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is impressive and spectacular: the dome archads and clusters rely on square columns and are illuminated by rays of the sun made of brightly colored windows.
Blue content and cultivation is the traditional attraction of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Housebird owners place doves in courtyards, under trees, on herds.
The enthralling sight, it takes off into the sky a flock of white pigeons, like the flashes of a holiday fireworks.
To defend themselves against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
The harbor of Derbent was locked by the construction, a 500 - foot [500 m] - wide [500 m] seaward.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were incorporated into the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved ancient Persian fortification observatory.
The carpets in Derbent were still being woven in the fifth century, and to this day, the technology of this unique craft has remained virtually unchanged.
In one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold on any taste - strips of wool, cotton, or tungsten of all colors and shades, with ores and without a coat, with complex ornaments, and a snug wash.
The building of the city began with the mills, blocks, and single - story stone structures.
Over the years, the masonry has barely changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioning plates, and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval city of modern times.
In the old part of the city, parts of a water pipeline built by the Persians some thousands of years ago were preserved.
To this day, ancient sources have been found in which the locals still collect water.
Many derbents prefer conventional water from taps to water from proven historical fountains.
One of the pottery centers in Derbent was located.
Fuel and painting vases, dishes, bushes, and cups were all prized in the Caucasus.
The potter’s arms now produce excellent ceramics, both practical and souvenir.
On the days of the festivals and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under the tension of the rope, which is attended by students of the Republican School of Circuit Arts.
There is a history of amazing and risky skill for several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly visible among the Kanatauts.
The ex-Devićy Bani is now a museum, the culture and the life of the Ancient Derbent.
In the past, unmarried girls and bridesmaids have been washed up here, accompanied by a friend, and now anyone who wants to see a garbage pool, a hot and cold pool that has entered the previous bathing supplies.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but the cans and couples of our day are as popular as they were in former times.
It's written in old books about the benefits of heating the body.
After the bath, blood improves, muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The Festival, the Commonwealth, which takes place in the Narin Kala fortress area, is attended by ethnodoors from many parts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, play songs of the Caucasus people and feast visitors with delicious home cheese.
The Kirchlar is the burial place of the forty martyrs who set their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most respected Muslim complexes in the Northern Caucasus.
The yellowish sarcophages are cut out of whole stone blocks and oriented along the west-east axis as assumed by the Arabs.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubova are cutting and barking clients in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
Parikmacheri has been in this area for many years now.
The craft is passed from generation to generation.
In doing so, the brothers of Yakubova can make not only traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
A house on one of the streets of the Old City was preserved, where the Caucasian writer Alexander Bestujev-Marlinski lived.
He studied Turkic and compiled ethnographic material, describing Derbent, the first third of the 19th century, with his ancient monuments, life, and home of citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional East club with only tea and homemade baking.
Men come here to give a boost to their thirst, talk to their friends and solve some working problems.
As in past times, women are not encouraged to pass the threshold of kettle.
The Derbent dance ensemble, Caspiania, was established three years ago, but has been able to participate in the activities of the Republican and Russian levels.
The band’s soloists rehears every day on the basis of popular arbitrari, Dorginian, Tatar, Armenian dances.
At night, when noise and streetlights come to light, the natives spread out on benches near houses with terras.
As a general rule, derbents discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the Jubilee, they increasingly remember episodes of their city's unique history that affected the fate of the whole Black Sea-Caspian region.
There was a business game at the airport in Domodedou.
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students tried to serve as airport officials.
In order to do so, the models of the three airlines were mounted in Domodedov.
Not only did the young people inspect and register passengers but they also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it is not in the face of reality.
The late flights, two fractured passengers on board, lost their way somewhere on the plane.
For the real airport, hell.
For the one that was justified in the Domodedov hangar, the standard set of tasks to be decided by the newcomers.
One hangar had three major airports around the world.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn about the domestic world of aviation.
Registration of passengers, servicing of aircraft, moving of luggage, they even had buses on the flight field, tramps and inspection of passengers.
And the passengers are all in trouble.
One document mess, the other was late on the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And you need to deal with all of this, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, as if the airline had paid the corresponding amount for the service of the flight.
- A fine is imposed for failing to perform the tasks involved - in an interview with West Moscow - a financial analyst for the Dmitry Hilko game.
Officials from the Ministry of Education follow closely.
For them, the exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
She had already found a place in secondary vocational education.
Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact become new models of modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment, - tells the Director of the Department of Public Policy in the area of labour training and additional vocational education of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Natalia Goldenarewa.
But students don't get to global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend.
However, the scores for the examination were quite tangible.
The newest smart points I've ever seen!
- I got them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim - the pleasure of the game player, the team's Pier Manager - The Airport Frankfurt - Sergey Shivaliv.
The best judges, as they call them, have taken to the pencils to invite to their jobs by the time they completed their studies.
The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre ' s Foreign Literature Library.
The Centre has been working in Moscow for over 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government ' s unilateral decision to close the American Embassy Centre at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
- The unilateral steps taken by the RF recently call into question the Russian Government ' s commitment to relations between the Russian and American peoples, which did not interrupt even during the cold war and at other difficult moments in the long history of our countries - is stated in the statement by Ambassador John Tefft of the United States, who went to Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and lasting links between human beings and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place with numerous American personalities, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
Last year alone, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors, emphasized a diplomat.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it had been decided to close another Russian-American project, the FLEX Education Exchange Program (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was put to death.
Typical situation: Four officials are standing at the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his claims for work done.
The Court is not at all satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you an 110-page order to make fun of him,' Kumar says.
If there's any more bricks placed, we're going to put down all the available structures.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NWT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt rapid environmental pollution that is accompanying the booming economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has begun to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction that leads to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: over a 60-year short period since the declaration of the independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute is the problem in major megapolises, where infrastructure is not being developed for rapid urbanization: cities are being hit by dense power, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and few remaining housing units are being cut off by new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the lifting of major investment projects.
For example, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the decisions of the court “extreme” — and “impossible” —
Sometimes it is indeed impossible to comply with the court's deadline, confirming the Raj Panjwani environmental counsel.
However, inadvertent dedlines also have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
- His main purpose is to break the system - is to add a lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already cancelled major constructions on many occasions: in its account, the termination of the construction of an airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
And people are also trying to keep in mind, for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagna, which contaminated a local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
- People lose their jobs - commented on his decision to Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people whose lives may change as a result of the passing of one piece of a judge’s pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over the age of 10 from entering the capital, rather than causing public outrage.
In spite of the rapidly declining popularity and criticism, Swatánter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of New Delhi statistics on the entry and exiting vehicle, as well as a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously known in factories whether they were in a position to comply with such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to reach the court's attention, people's anger began to slow down.
But the most painful theme of the judge of principle was the clean-up programme of the Ganges River, with the pump annotated by Prime Minister Narendroy Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and goes on shouting.
You know what the word \"holy\" means
Someone poured water out of the Ganges into the statue of God, and in it were fecals, the judge was hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think Ganges is the Ganges, he'll take away all our sins.
It's the river we worship, and see what you're doing to it every day.
The Ganga clean-up is the most ambitious and costly environmental project that the new Government has introduced.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the rate of more than 120 times.
Every year between 1.5 million and 3 million Hindus bathing in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga Rescue Fund the money from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and an additional 455 items from his personal collection.
The environmentalists here accused the premier of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while the river was cleared for at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be environmental.
“In a developing country, environmental talk is often perceived as an unwelcome luxury,” says the activist of the Ganga-Malika Bhanot organization.
And the court is trying to find the golden middle between ecology and development --
