I'm not sure I agree with him.
The chief let me leave earlier today.
At what time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in bad humor, I start singing.
I owe him nothing.
Where's your key?

It's delicious!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one's listening anymore.

You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit there.
Put it down.

You can do that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what the stapler looks like.
I can't confirm it.
Mary guarantees that.
I got the wrong bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary had already done what she was supposed to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you reserve the table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn it off, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets for a concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom phoned Mary this morning.
Maybe another time.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need that one here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a place cannot discern the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a circle and a fries potato.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Is everything okay?
Maybe you're the only one who can do that.
Who doesn't have the radio?
Your singing makes professional singers red with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's full.
He was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week, I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how it's done.
Drink?
Is Tom gonna do this with you?
Don't you sleep?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she liked it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary was not busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do this.
The presence of all members is compulsory.
Isn't it convenient for you?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do that again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do this with?
We are pleased with the decision.
That skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
The Witness who has seen everything in his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom's back at the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's gone.
When I went into the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom put out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party was?
Mary's high.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll buy it.
I don't want to.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
Lock off your good health.
Yes, I will!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying long?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I set my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Wear salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at nine.
Tom speaks fluently in French.
John caught the tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it myself.
Tom's dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The next month, Tom leaves Boston.
It's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year, millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter contained an erroneous address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's in chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just cut my hair off.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
We owe it to ourselves.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
So Tom became famous.
You spent a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I've done everything right.
I love writing.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
The next month, I get sixteen.
Do you think there's a chance that this will happen?
Deal with your dreams.
What time will your final lesson end?
I'm here to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We need to help him.
It was raining all day.
I'm upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock stays for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon shines at night.
I got up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom's gonna help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm in trouble with the boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London was filled with fog.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to conduct it.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.

But his music is nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
There are seven colors in the rainbow.
I guess that's why we shouldn't do that.
He's gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to what he says.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
You or Jane should go there.

Give it back.
How strange!
Can you read the Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I'd never be able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and groceries for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay you later?
Did it just happen?
Mary didn't take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
In truth, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.

Do you know what causes the problem?
Where Is Boston?
I need your opinion.
She doesn't understand German.
Does she hide anything?
Tom said he was curious.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new home.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity.

Tom's reading the novels.
Get the trash out of here.

He's got two cars.
They realized it.
No problem!

I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Answer me now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was missing the house.

Do you like juice?
I knew they'd suspect her.
He jumped through a puddle.
Don't die, please!
Who won?
What exactly are some arguments that can help you?
Would they do that?
I have to help him, he's my friend.
Are you ready for the exam?
All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.
I'd do it if you didn't stop me.
The problem is you.

I wonder if Tom would actually go to Mary's concert.
Did Tom say he spent the last weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
A child has died.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're going to lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Say it.
The surface of the balloon is a non-euclidic space, so the rules of euclid geometry are not followed.
The negotiations were successful.
I apologize for that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and upright.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice as old as I am.
A journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming languages is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear it.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many clocks do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So you don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom's very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My tie's orange.
Does Tom cry yet?
So I'd like to be taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
That's not my idea.
You have a plan, right?
He's walking.
Tom's out of town.
I had shoes worn out.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a yellow dress.
Love has a bitter taste.
The meeting was over.
You should have done that last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I'm going every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
We're on the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went into the forest looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything else.
He persecuted the thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
Doing this will not be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat right now.
The mirror fragments were scattered across the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She went to school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I should do that.
The government debt goes up.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom's probably never gonna do that.
That's the doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bicycle?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
It's spending too much time on the Internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's get to know him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't need it.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner tonight?
You can't even change the pampers.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom had ever asked Mary why she had dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
The brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
No rules.
Leila became pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make raw fish salad?
Tom knew Mary.
Tom's making breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Obviously, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We were actually driving to Boston.
Iceland has many volcanoes.
John's two years older than I am.
For better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He could easily answer my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love children.
Who's left?
When does she arrive?
It's not my style.
Try to concentrate.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Does Tom still live near you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I speak.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd love Tom.
Are you hungry yet?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
That was in the mid - 20th year.
Tom's gonna do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short period of peace, war was resolved again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The Dutch capital is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
\"Where is my laptop?\" — \"On the table.\"
I don't think there will be any problems.
Is Tom broken?
You need to jump.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it work?
You're so ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'm done with the shirt.
When is his return expected?
I had a good break.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It'd be good if there were 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the town where I was born.
He would like to see no disaster.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They can catch fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for her gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is boring.
He's a robot man, so to speak.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any pulleys.
It's a fake.
It's not Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often mistaken.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and it was Gran Pry's broadcast.
Tom's proud of her daughter.
Don't look back.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of an amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English isn't my own language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, we should not do so again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom's staring at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do this?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I scored thirty points.
If I don't, Tom's gonna get angry.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road and, while I was driving, stopped my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe there is a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student and he's not.
I was trying to do exactly that.
I wrote a book.
Be quiet, please.
I bought my son new sledge.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, born the same year as I, and now she's preparing for her exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you complete your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help. So paint the fence.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
A dick.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the papers on a visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The rope broke as we went up the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, are you?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to get to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you seeing anybody?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Daddy?
Shut the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
Apples do not fall far from the apple tree.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in the jeans.
See you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Do you ignore me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you for ever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
You want to do that, don't you?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me see Tom's book.
The major islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoko, Honshu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money at the bank.
I think we should leave now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We set up our office with computers.
We have to pay early.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom's gonna do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the subject of criticism.
It's going to be brilliant.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quick!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom's gonna do it?
Tom witnessed in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask you your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying me.
I know many French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the violin?
Can you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks good French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was popular with both students and teachers.
You can't help with tears of grief.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want to go.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how well we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom's trying to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks to the Esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom have done that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's friend.
I'll handle it.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let him turn you on?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Is Tom really moving to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Isn't it still cold for you?
Language carriers subconsciously follow the rules of their own language without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their guns at the elephant.
No one's moving.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
I'd like to take the money.
I shake Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about the exam tomorrow.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom started a thread.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't run.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend the vacation?
This year you got a Christmas present from Tom?
I still miss my home a little bit and so many things seem strange to me.
I sometimes have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check your voice mail.
It speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little off the graph.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi here?
Come on, you'll be late.
It'll be difficult.
Does Tom always behave like this?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait a minute, you said \"girl\" or \"boy\"
It'll work, you'll see.
She threw him away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So it was a pity to Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, she's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone but me is late.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I don't plan to miss the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed at your effectiveness.
Didn't you have a car before?
You were at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I did.
She went to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language can be compared to a time - consuming tree, esperantha can be compared to an artificial plastic tree.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We'll walk.
Did Tom tell you what happened?
I finally realized I was not in love with you.
You said 'cause I was kidding?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's excruciating.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get the trash out of here.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston card?
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
It's going to be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
If you hire him, you should take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his hard-core idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a doctor son.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have anything from the headache?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus was on its way.
Tom's in a black coat tonight.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We generally spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They're no good now.
You tried talking to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends ridiculed her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I had said.
I doubt Tom could win.
The aliens are coming and taking our jobs away from us.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Will you ride the train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
So you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He left abroad and never returned.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I'm pretty good.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Are you done?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but I'm taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It matters to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I knew what my mistake was.
I love trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can we get a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy and can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting a fever.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think someone's listening?
No luck!
Tom, you could say, nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to leave early.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is, solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do I say “thank you ” in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom's wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You're such an excruciating man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you spoke French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's worthless.
I am very interested in studying French.
It's a good thing to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're pleased with your work.
Do you work nearby?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm not nice.
You always make mistakes.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
The variants are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was cancelled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Can't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did that?
Did you do that?
I'm having a night's sleep problem.
Tom sometimes makes me angry.
I dance quite well.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious you're going to have to stay overnight.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair grew thinner and thinner.
My sister went to Kobe yesterday.
Don't you speak from the point of view of experience?
He loves ice cream.
I was hungry.
What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I do.
The street's empty again.
Tom couldn't catch the rabbit.
All dogs are loyal.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so happy.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Will you not stay with us?
It's Communism.
This is where the river suddenly narrows.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do that.
Tom is a very practical person.
I have a good mother-in-law.
I need political asylum.
It was cozy after the storm.
There's no simple way to succeed.
There's the train.
He loves tigers.
It rains, so we can't do this.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
Are you all right?
Don't sleep with the light turned on.
He's not stupider than you are.
Trains in Serbia are extremely slow.
I think Tom's bad.
- Cone - - set of word - leave ♪
Where's the ashtray?
Can you explain what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell him the truth.
He didn't dare say, \"No, my plan.
Tom told the annoying neighbor to take up his life and stop the soying of his nose to the affairs of others.
It was part of the plan.
Countless stars were visible in the sky.
Apples do not fall far from the apple tree.
We wait until they leave.
Tom's changed his face.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
I used to live next to Tom.
Speak louder, please.
You can sit where you want.
I think Yumi's sick.
Price reflects demand.
Why do you like her?
You're still angry, aren't you?
The fence needs to be painted.
We need to call Tom.
It's a good thing that you've been able to help.
Run and don't look around.
We're on our way home.
