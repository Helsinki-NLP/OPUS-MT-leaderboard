Two men committed suicide in Kineshm and the district
Previously, one of the hangers had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1 p.m., a man born in 1947 was killed by hanging in the village of Lugowa.
He was known to have attempted suicide earlier.
What made a man so unknown.
On 31 October, between 11 and 50, a 41-year-old man living in Kineshma was killed in his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, MID-Kineshsky press service reported
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair a scattered highway system, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box, carefully fitted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, monitoring and conveying each mile of traffic to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the obsolete financing system for American highways undertaken by planning bodies in Washington, D.C. and State.
Usually, the boring motorway planning arena suddenly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the granting of the Government the right to use small lizards to track the number of miles you travel, and perhaps even where you travel, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
Chaspitia movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues regarding private life.
Although Congress cannot yet agree, continue or fail, several states do not meet.
They reflect on the way in the next decade to the system in which drivers pay for each mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motor vehicles have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“It is not an issue on which we can choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who is preparing plans to begin monitoring by the State of the miles to which every California motor vehicle is travelling by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government ' s Highway Fund, which is financed by taxes that Americans pay on vehicles.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to tax even one cent at high gasoline prices.
“A gas tax cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 monitoring devices on vehicles to test the error-paying system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
The nudes call it a wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change travel patterns to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning authorities in California are looking at the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of the House ' s Transport Committee, said that he also saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market contributors to the Reason Foundation are also happy that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go to the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason, Vice-President for Political Affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who called on Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of payment.
The US Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 vehicles.
However, the House of Representatives leaders rejected the offer because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often spend many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of mileage instead of a gas tax.
A pilot project has been completed in Nevada.
It's under consideration in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Transport Departments of 17 Eastern Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can carry out these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every step of them.
“A large brother's security and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, in charge of strategy and performance management in the State of Nevada Department of Transport.
That wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were well under way, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website that “it will not be difficult yet to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices”.
There is no need to create a vast, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states that is running a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of vehicle miles, but without information about location and time.
If you can do that, said Han, society would feel more calm.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in helping to collect taxes from the state.
It sought to enter the growing market in a form of motor insurance where drivers pay on the basis of traffic.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded with the modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and track their position,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in some of these State pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less imposing ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with various options available to drivers.
They may select a device with or without GPS.
Or they could completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average number of miles that all residents of the state are going through.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea to the alert public by making the devices do more than less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that will also accept fees for parking counters, provide “pays as you travel” insurance coverage, and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
“Automobilists will involve the benefits they will be offered”, states the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether all the conversation is not just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could have simply overcome the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by taxing gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
The EU is preparing measures of support for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia.
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide gas to Ukraine and to reach an agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with IMF on stand-by loans, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim was to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential IMF loan, Ukraine can obtain 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Reuters analysts doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about funding conditions.
He did not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, nor did the international S&P rating agency, which, on Friday, had a single degree of sovereign ranking for Ukraine - before - B - c - B -
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU ' s financial support plan, there is a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now originating from Russia.
It may be a North Stream gas or a turnout from Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia - is isolated - Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“The EU and Ukrainian countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes - added the Reiter source.
Russia — Beyond the Pollution of Cities by Cars
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most of the world’s megapolises since the second half of the twentieth century.
Generally, these included either re-engineering and expansion of routes or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time it took to use them.
The example of Singapore, which introduced strict quotas for the increase in the number of private vehicles, is well known and is purchased by auctions.
Its price could be two or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, imposed fees for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart introduce so-called green areas to allow entry only to vehicles with a certain ecoclass, which also uses high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012, with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As explained by the Director of Transport Pollution Control, Beijing ' s Lee Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year-old was to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private vehicles to no greater than 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and to increase by not more than 5 per cent the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, Beijing has now been responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme were to restrict the use of road transport, as well as to impose additional taxes on car owners.
Among other things, the Green Five-Year urban measures include the accelerated transition to Eurostandard fuels, the introduction of a local system of ecostandards and marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (otherwise, the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace older vehicles with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and service vehicles), and the development of public transport (including high-speed vehicles).
Beijing's road innovation also includes the prohibition for all private cars to travel within the fifth transport ring (total six in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (the related information is contained in the vehicle's registration plate), as well as registration signs for vehicles based on lottery (e.g., in 2011, the first year of lottery operation, the total number of registration permits for private vehicles in Beijing was only one third of the 2010 figure).
According to the current State Programme - Environmental Protection 2012-2020 - the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 mobile sources accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times more industrial and in St. Petersburg nine times.
In the Russian Federation, the possibility of restrictive car regulation in the streets of cities is still just beginning to be considered.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy, Mr. Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at curbing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular, and can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car fleet, where two clusters are weakly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal cars, as well as privy cars - users with a total number of at least 200,000 (about 5% of Moscow ' s total vehicle fleet).
A study was prepared by urbanists from the ECO centre in St. Petersburg to analyse the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and vehicle capacity.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is equipped with roads twice as much as the required traffic, and most motor vehicles in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking or on the streets for long periods.
As a result, it is proposed that the vehicle storage facilities should not be expanded but that the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians) be reduced to the use and location of personal transport within the boundaries of the historical centre ' s protected area (generally some 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The costs of unauthorized street trade in Vologist will increase as
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to bring order to the Vologistda and free the streets from natural tents and boats.
Most street traders do not pay the taxes they use, and often they do not undergo consistent sanitary control.
This means that the health of the dampers is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase six times since November, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reporting to the Voloda Authority press service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the unpaid consumer credit crisis and the massive reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather that growth is structured.
In recent times it has been entirely driven by consumption that is almost free of trade - a leading economist, Goldman Sachs, for Russia, Clemens Grafe, reporting a quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy yesterday.
The current nominal wage increase in Russia is about 10 per cent.
In inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they're likely to be optimizing staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP by only 2%, Mr. Graphe explained.
Companies have experienced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it can lead to dismissals and an increase in unemployment.
The main economist, Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantoushin, makes no comment.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to lure employees away or keep the current ones.
The consumption in Russia has also been characterized by a rapid increase in the demand for credit.
Mr. Graphe felt that, owing to the very high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending did not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“The benefits to the economy from growing demand for credit have never been seen, the money does not go away in terms of economy, but goes back to the same banks in the form of interest payments” said the economist.
But the problem with another is Goldman Sachs is expecting a growing gap in unsecured credit.
They are mainly taken by people who have nothing to offer for security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently - Mr. Graphe noted.
The second threat to economic growth in Russia, therefore, is a possible crisis of unpaid loans.
The director of the U.S.S. Banking Institute, Vasily Solokov, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the State banks, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
The State bank responded to the war and began to reduce credit rates, and the economist continued.
Small credit organizations are unable to issue loans for the same percentages, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If there is no de-mping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasiliy Sodakov believes.
Deprivation of a number of bank licences in recent weeks has been regarded by the economist as a predictor of a massive collapse.
“The State banks themselves will not deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis” warns the head of the institute.
But the increase in consumption will also slow down without a crisis of underpayment, believed in an investment bank, due to the refusal to index the salaries of the public servants and the military, as set out in the current version of the budget draft.
The partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and consequently by reducing inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet -- see the tape), consumption growth is still slow, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantoushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
- The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil - he says.
It estimated that Russia’s economy would begin to decline at a cost of oil below $90/barre.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CBS is not yet in a position to reduce interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is that inflation has dropped and banks have begun to raise stakes.
That might mean they didn't believe the C.B.E. who announced the transition to inflation, said Clemens Graffe.
The cent policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect the market rates only.
- For the CB, it's the collapse of all hope - graded Clemens Count.
Banks use the money obtained at the C.B. auctions to manage liquidity rather than lending the economy
Once the rate is reduced, the exchange rate is immediately changed, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the rouble.
“Once or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working” said Mr. Grafé and recalled that the State was planning to put the rouble in free swimming by the end of 2015.
But you'll either have to do this sooner or raise the key rate of CB (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
He's estimated that the ruby course is now artificially over 10 per cent.
The rub is only one road -- weak, an expert concludes.
But if the C.B. had the financialists doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor was not part of the rouble policy, it could be much more damaging to the rouble.
The Second Congress of the peoples of South Ural took place in Chelabinsk.
The Forum commemorates the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian Statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all the cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious faiths, legislative and executive bodies, took part in the meeting, totalling about 350 persons.
The forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-national harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in full understanding, for Feophan, the metropolitan Chelabinski and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
Following the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of the ethnic and cultural associations of the Chelabin region was opened here.
Snouden is ready to “co-operate” with Germany on the question of US intelligence
Edward Snouden, the U.S. scout, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about his activities.
German deputy Hans Christian Streobele met with Mr. Snouden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snouden, a deputy who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that give no protection”.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snouden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to refuse criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of Home Affairs, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowen is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA had overheard the Chancellor's phone, Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a member of the Parliamentary Intelligence Group, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States in its entirety”, it should be used.
Mr. Streubelle, a Member of Parliament of the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snoudden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streubelle said that, according to a lawyer from a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowen could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snouden had testified in Germany, he would have needed to guarantee that he would be “in security” there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's reaction to “his political speech”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high officials — including those in the United States — have found the disclosure of an uncontrollable system of surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a hand deposit fee
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers for carrying a hand put on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand put and $2 for a coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new manual laying fee is applied to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said he was going to charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers were to pay only when they were on a landing trip.
Frontier Kate O'Mally said that the $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment beforehand.
“We don’t want to charge a fee,” she said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second bags of luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these fees will get as much as they can into the hand put into the upper luggage compartments, which often results in lack of space in these compartments.
The meeting is one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really for making money.
The fact is, Frontier's most loyal clients say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn on Frontier's flight can be able to pass the bag free of charge while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the web site and at the Frontier registration booths was intended to ensure that passengers would be aware of the collection before they got to get to the landing.
Frontier ' s new collection for manual laying will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about the payment of luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider adding baggage to be a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual laying charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual laying fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air disco later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, Spirit manual laying fees bring about $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, was recently flying a Spirit flight, and he was curious that he would find out for a landing when passengers would face an unusual Spirit collection for a hand put.
“The landing process was the smoothest one I've ever seen for my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a scrap of teeth and a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing was fast.
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 per coffee, tea, gas or juice fees.
Frontier stated that passengers receiving gas or juice could keep the entire bank and that the share of coffee would be available free of charge.
She'll still distribute the water free of charge.
US Airways had tried to charge for drinks in 2008 for a short time, but had refused to do so seven months after passengers had started complaining and no other large airline had followed its example.
Frontier's manual laying fee initiative, when passengers don't buy tickets directly from an airline, is her last step in attracting customers to her website.
The airlines pay online tickets like Orbitz from $10 to $25 for every ticket they sell.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to access the tourism online agency.
However, Frontier went beyond all in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many bonus miles of often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the mile.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Fronttier from an online travel agency would have resulted in 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only be chosen in advance if they buy tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business goes down and becomes lost.
The revenue fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities declined by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to a financial output published on the Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline sales.
NSA blames for “internal error” rather than for hackers to shut down the site
The National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the termination of their site for hours caused a technical malfunction, not hackers, as was alleged on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours this evening due to internal error that occurred during the planned renewal,” reported the intelligence agency in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statement that the interruption in the work was caused by a distributed “denial” [DDoS] type of denial of service was incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site was not operational for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Previously, an NSA representative informed ABC News that the agency's internal secret network “not at all” had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of activist hackers stated that it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA site using the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to trap the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, once called No Such Agency, had been at the centre of public attention in recent months and bitter criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and inside the country, all of which had responded to the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and published by an disappointed former NSA official, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier's profits are falling with the supply and number of aircraft orders falling
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported, on Thursday, a 15 per cent reduction in net profits due to reduced orders and transfers of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The company of Bombardier in Montreal has also not published any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by the next September have been carried out.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft sample, held about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results failed to correct the forecasts and resulted in more than 8 per cent fall in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doercksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher average” to “medium market” because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in air supply was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the arrivals of the transport department,” said Doercksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will get new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we are assuming that the market will be more sceptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will enable it to gain a seat in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot sample of the aircraft was submitted in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
However, solid orders for CSeries are not yet too much, 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the company ' s allegations of fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
The chief executive director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve his goal of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward on the plan.
“The plane's test model was not left on the ground longer than expected,” said Boduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades had been scheduled for the aircraft.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the upgrade, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples must be flown in the coming weeks and all the others will shortly follow it, as the company has reported.
Still, analysts are sceptical about the claim that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the period of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests - although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule - supports our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ending 30 September, Bombardier's net income decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million or 9 cents per share last year.
The adjusted return on the stock remains at nine cents.
Gross income decreased slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a return of 10 cents for equity and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth aircraft manufacturer reported that he placed 45 aircraft per quarter, a decrease in the previous year’s figure of 57.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The space Department's order portfolio was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, as from 31 December.
“In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the overall market environment became an unpleasant factor,” said Boduan.
Gross income on the aerospace track fell 13 per cent — to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that the gross income in the sector had grown by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit's order portfolio was $32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than the figure of 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been adversely affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, who also announced that Google’s chief financial director, Patrick Piett, would enter the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent, to $4.83 in tenders in mid-January.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world ' s third commercial manufacturer and closest competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony relies on a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profits for the current fiscal year.
Sony ' s results during the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, owing to the falling demand for television, video cameras and personal computers from the Japanese corporation ' s production.
Sony's television business, in its second quarter, was the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, again falling to 9.3 billion yen during the reporting period.
Japan’s consumer electronics market has been going through difficult times, especially as the demand for television has decreased.
And while competitors seek a solution, Sony continues to concentrate on the consumer segment.
For example, Sony, Panasonic, a major rival, has recently shifted the emphasis on industrial kits: sales are growing at a high rate, especially from automotive systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the March 2014 financial year, Sony expects 179 billion yen of operating profits against the previously anticipated 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher and that it would be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, sales of smart hours were launched from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to deliver the smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company lost more than 11 per cent of its shares at the opening of the Tokyo to a price in the morning, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The gene of speech was the stimulant of the synapses
Scientists at John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered proteins that make the gene of speech Foxp2 function to stimulate the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be read in summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 by identifying a family of several who could not speak correctly and who sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have been disturbed by the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function is to stimulate the formation of new synapses in the brain in the area of speech formation.
This is done by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 being shown only for its activity.
What SRPX2 really has an impact on volatilization, scientists have confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When animals were artificially reduced, they would scream less when separated from their mother.
If gene activity was restored, the frequency of sound produced was restored.
Previously, there was also a link to the volatilization of Foxp2 itself.
The animals that were introduced into the human copy of the gene were more active and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and its SRPX2 are related to sound properties or finer processes.
Legalist with cocaine addiction, who warned the criminal leader of the police investigation, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough.
Counsel feared that his clandestine drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A senior attorney who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he feared that his clandestine drug addiction had been exposed was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted secret information to Neil Scarboro on his investigation of illicit drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who was named among the criminals as “hard lawyer”, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarboro, which he had previously represented at a drug court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough had left three packages of cocaine at the home of a lawyer in Blackburn County Lancashire while he was at the dinner of an association of lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta had “regularized” the Class A drug after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain unlawful information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarboro as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during this period as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal heroin and cocaine marketing organization in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisaide, Berkshire and Western Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids amounting to £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
Ditt's 42-year-old information was transmitted to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Riverpool Court of Ditta, which works for Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburne law firm, was disgraced after a confession of guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in one of the previous court sessions.
The publicisation of the lawyer took place after the police following Scarborough found that he had been talking to Ditt on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found that he came to Dittt's house in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent of his purity drugs in black golf gloves under the lawyer's garbage boxes.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough was called many times with Ditt, who was at dinner at the football stadium of Iwood Park by the Blackburn Rowers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations were held between them.
The court found out that Ditta had “regularly used” cocaine after tests had found traces of a class A drug in his hair, purse and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he was talking to a suspected dealer, because he was his client, and insisted that their association was a “advocacy secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At the police interrogation, he said that along with his work place, he had a home office, and his clients came to his home in legal cases.
However, the court became aware that after important arrests he had called the largest drug dealers, a number of whom he had previously represented before the court to tell them that they were known by detectives.
In an indictment, Anne White said, \"If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer.\"
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relations between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police from investigating as strongly as possible to allow those persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, he disgraced her.
He got too close to certain customers, particularly Scarborough, and questioned his uninteresting interest.
Ditta did not accept the blame and said, \"If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and would like to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.\"
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main actors in the criminal gang, who had entrusted him with providing valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation led Lancashire's unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already reached its verdict in three cocaine storage cases, and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just penalty for offenders.
Let the case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after he confessed his guilt in collusion for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 individuals who participated in the machinations were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta had a question-and-answer discussion in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer who represented clients with a death sentence in America, his perfect companion for dinner, Mohammed Ali, and his motivation for work was inequality.
The station in Jaroslavla was not ready for the reception of 22,000 police officers who were present today at the meeting of the FARC.
In their view, the ticket program is about twice as high.
During the 1/16 match, Russia’s Spartac Cup was attended by only a thousand stewards at a regulatory rate of 9,000.
Spartan fans had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium capacity, but, as agreed with the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold.
This data was read by Arthur Grigoriantz, head of the CDC.
Americans Listened to Japanese High Officials
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States intelligence services, who preferred not to reveal his name, stated that the United States had been listening to telephone conversations by senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that there are several points in the country of rising sun that are intended to be heard.
He noted, however, that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, in spite of allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, was the object of intelligence activity, and the NHK television channel reported.
None of the parties have yet formally commented on this information.
Remember, news of U.S. security guards tracking the chancellor, F.G.G., came last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the past 10 years.
The chancellor himself has, according to some reports, taken notice of his audition very painfully.
She stated that the allies whom she believed to be the FRG and the United States for decades were similar to that of the head of government.
Meanwhile, Edward Snouden stated that he was ready to share details of the wiretap of telephone conversations with officials of the German Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The German arrived specifically in Moscow to meet a former CIA official.
Bashkaria may not be able to tender grain until early 2014
During government procurement interventions, Baskeria may place grain on tenders not earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
At present, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales into the intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and there's demand.
“Perhaps the grain will be put to the tender, after New Year’s Eve,” he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the 2013 crop crop was 3.1 million hectares this year, including 1.7 million hectares, an increase of 3.3 per cent over last year.
The 2014 crop has a yield of 550,000 hectares (105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the flesh remains at the previous level.
There is no grouping at the IDP bases - the Brat Circle - to which Leps was assigned in the United States
The databases of Russian factional forces - the Brat Circle - to which Washington assigned a singer, Gregory Leps, do not mean anything.
As noted by Interfax, the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports were made in the media that Gregory Leps, the U.S. Treasury Department, had been screened for suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate - the Brat Circle - all databases had been verified, but no such group had been found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operates abroad, and is believed to be in force.
\"Even in the very name, the \"Brat Circle,\" there's some element of mystery, there's a hint on the secret bed.
- It's all very much like a Piracy Action. - The agency's interviewer said.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced the entry into its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate, the Brat Circle: Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsweridze, Wadima Lailin, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob of Ribal and Igor Schlykov.
Persons on this list are suspected of being linked to a certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps is serving as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontjev.
In the production centre of Gregory Leps, they refused to comment on US charges against the singer, calling them a breech
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Syndicat - the Brat Circle - as a number of substantial transnational organized criminal groups - and commissioned the Minfina - to undermine and outlaw their global criminal operations -

Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and thoughtless outbursts, got on the smoking hook.
The Canadian City police said that they had video tapes and were ready to initiate an investigation against the national chief.
He said that he would not leave his post, he told CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appears on the Toronto police site.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but that he was handing it over for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford’s compromising video was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid conducted by Order Guards in the summer of 2013.
The video had previously been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The Mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says he's not responsible for anything and he's not going to resign.
An armed police video recording is one of the evidences of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisie, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, gain of illicit income, and criminal conspiracy.
Lisa was sometimes a driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought journalists on numerous occasions, got drunk in the public, and allowed himself to talk racist and sexist.
The UAO-Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the site's genetics selection tender.
The contract amount at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project is to be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in the spring of 2014.
The new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, interior roads and airport development components, will have to be designed by the winner.
In the first phase of construction, the interior area of the terminal will be 50,000 m2, and it may be further increased.
According to the information provided by Rostovaeroinvesta, the development of the airport complex will be taken into account in the design documentation: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and 6 million passengers by 2035.
By the time the outcome of the tender had been finalized, the architectural concept of the Aerobacsal Complex, Southern, had been developed by the British company Twelve Architectures.
The main terminal project is the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Don and other cities around the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E to Sheremjetjevo International Airport and a new airway complex at Knević International Airport in Vladivostok.
The International Airport complex, Southern, will be built in the Axai district of Rostov district and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed down in the future integrated into the urban structure.

A politician in Turkey declared a hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaybin in south-eastern Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the PMD's pro-court party took a strong stand against construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike protesting the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and reported RIA News to the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) press service on Friday.
The police have repeatedly pushed out protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güller, first refuted the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
- Mayor Nusaybina Ishe Hekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle - - stated to the party press.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish people of two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
- This is an inhumane situation that Kurds will never agree with - - cited by Aisha Hekhan of the party.
According to press reports, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a foreign exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolivian currency, in relation to the tourist dollar.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific course of the Bolía with respect to the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 billion dollars.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bondholders.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 per cent of its value.
In September, the inflation rate in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister of Oil and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the painkiller.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing prices of products and goods of widespread consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of goods and the operation of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
South Africa Director Andrey Belmach noted that it is not yet easy to say how long it will take to find a new lead trainer.
This post became vacant after Sergei Chapelev's resignation.
The resignation just took place a few hours ago, so tell me how much time it takes to find a new coach, I'm not ready, is bringing the words of Belmach to IT-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all the options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, but someone who works in our club for a couple of years can make a difference.
Kenyan press outraged by the media ' s provocative law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason for the question: what might prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, manager of the Capital Group, the parent of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased as it is a continuation of the Government” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media a dead shack”, while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “get serious blows” and criticized the bill as “draconowski”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who were sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly looting the expensive shopping centre.
David Kimayo, chief of police, responded by calling two journalists and a media official to be interrogated, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists could be fined up to one million at additional risk of being “dislisted”, that is, banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is sufficient to paralyse the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “enlivened blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut down, they can do whatever they think they can to do.
“No one will ever know,” wrote national journalist Mutum Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balancing forces in public life.
“The policies themselves would break the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were also targets of public anger in the past.
In May they voted to cancel the cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and to recover their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
Communicable payments by the crows will include a new line of expenditure, which will be the payment for major repairs to the house.
The standard two-room apartment will have to be paid between 100 and 400 roubles per month from the new year.
The Government of the region will have a clear norm.
But when you paint a ride, put stairs in order, or even replace an elevator, people will decide.
Such legislation was approved by district Duma deputies.
Vladimir Kynnikov, Chairman of the Voroneg Regional Duma, noted: “In this case, too, the order must be made - the ordering of the building capremont, the accumulation of funds not from companies - which we often register in Moscow - will, in Orenburg, somewhere else, be the State control over the spending of the funds that the inhabitants collect for the repair of multi-family houses.”
Under the control of the State, it's also a part-time construction.
The law protecting against conspirators has been approved by fraud in the final reading.
The document wasn't born in an empty place.
In our region, 45,000 people have been affected by dishonest builders.
Most problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law sets out the rights and obligations of all stakeholders in the construction sector.
Vladimir Kynnikov, president of the Voroneg Regional Duma, stated: “It is not a secret that abuse has also begun in this area, because in the 98th year, the palms were the same, and in the 2000s the same;
People started making money to cover the loophole, including the two laws.
Under Voroneje, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The Regional Parliament has passed such legislation not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problems related to illegal migrants in the region are at least estranged.
In the past year, for example, just over 100,000 foreigners have become involved in migration accounting.
But only 1 in 5 has officially issued a work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kynnikov, president of the Voroneg Regional Duma, said: \"They have broken the law but are not criminals\"
There's no court, and we need to deport them, and we need to keep them somewhere.
This decision was taken by the Federation to establish such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voroneg region, this is the Old Olchanka Semiluk district.
Well, lastly, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are fully exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but many parents are equally economical.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt 3rds or more, will be issuing housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, of six people -- dad, mom, baby, and three -- adopted children.
For them, it is normal for the State to acquire a 108-square-metre housing, which is 3 million roubles.
For the left bank or south-west micronation, an acceptable option is appropriate.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the town center for that amount.

U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence services have sometimes gone too far - when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and listening, U.S. intelligence services sometimes went too far — but a politician noted that 70 million people were not correct in the media.
I assure you that innocent people have not been hurt in this process, but the attempt to gather information has been.
Yes, in some cases it has gone too far and has been wrong.
I recognize this, as the President recognizes... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future - the Secretary of State of AFP quotes.
Italian seniors give way to young people
Italian unemployment has high scores.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was unemployed.
This has not been so bad since the Second World War.
This figure is higher among young people on several occasions.
40.4 per cent of the population between 15 and 24 years of age do not have employment.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment has already been carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and laws have enabled regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension.
Italy, on the other hand, was looking forward to Europe ' s common problem with the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that it will be justified when it comes to the early rotation of personnel.
The construction of the Moscow TPO will lead to
With each passing year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport resales (TPAs).
It is planned to introduce 255 TCUs by 2020.
What the project is going on is what our correspondent is doing.
A couple of months ago, the Metro of Smolen, the Arbatsco-Pokro line, built a fence.
The inscription stated that the vehicle replanting unit was in operation.
All of this was strange, since near Smolensky no ground transportation stops and therefore cannot be moved.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, some 130 metres, including a ground crossing through the Carmanic alley, must be overcome.
It's almost over now at Smolensky.
We've got out of the flower range, we've got a newspaper stand dismantled, and the asphalt has changed before the entrance.
There's the whole transportation hub.
Replanting facilities are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the Central Department of Transport.
No capital TCUs yet.
The flats include parking construction, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that impede the movement of passengers, and the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, no transporters are even involved in flat-walled TRUs, but rather are professional architects from the Department of Capital Repair in Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Michael Blinkin High School of Economics.
Sometimes it is enough roofing over the head and tablet to announce the time of the arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the Yasenev Metro recently opened a fully fledged, flat - aired transplant hub.
Let's not hang up, but with parking intercepts and a table indicating when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials write down everything in the TPO.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build all the 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Plans for 2020 now cover as many as 255 TCUs.
One and a half of them promise to give up this year.
Although there is a TCU development programme in the city, no qualitative criteria have been identified, according to Alexander Morozov, Co-Chair of the Public Organization - City and Transport -
The number of objects reported, but the quality of transplants at each site is often deteriorated.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first, a reduction in transplant time; second, a reduction in comfort time.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without falling under the rain.
In Moscow, on the other hand, the TCU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
Here's a good example of a subway.
In the past, suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway entered the square in front of the main entrance to the VCC.
Their stops were now moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street of the Kosmonovts.
Far away from the subway, far further from the manorels, it's closer to the residential homes.
It is a gift that the residents did not want an automobile station under the windows and complained about everything they could.
The capital TPOs in Moscow haven't been able to do anything right now.
The first of these started building five years ago at the Metro-Planernay.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it's really a model of how the replanting node that's being bought to investors turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there's bus perks, a hangover to keep out of the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the Chimkin Trolleybus No.202 and No.203 in Moscow’s TCU have failed to provide basic space.
They've been pulled away from the subway as strangers.
But there are more places left to trade.
It's just the clothes of 32 stores, and there's almost anything in it, from zoos to a car saloon.
Well, if any of the bus passengers are going to need to buy a new car on the road?
We have, when we build a capital TOU, why is it always a shopping mall?
The situation had recently reached its logical end when some of the parking lot had chosen to be marketed.
The third floor of TPU-Plannerna now has a heavy trade in parking spaces.
The vegetables, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the neurosonic speech and the guards who look at our photographer in a vicious way.
The transplant node has finally become a market.
The thing is, the Metro-Plannerna used to have a market, but it's been cut down.
And at the prefecture of the merchants, they paid off for the interception parking lot.
Still, because of the high prices there's always empty.
The funny thing is that the market has been cut to build a new flat TCU in its place.
That's the rocking.
At Coloujski, the approach from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
Following the construction of a shopping mall, allegedly a TPU, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours, when he is closed, he has to walk under the open air.
Yet, the construction of the Plannerna and Columbage are soon to be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the City's City Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPIs.
Four of them will be 25 stories apart from two or three underground layers.
The main monster will grow at Tushino Metro, which will have 418,000 square feet [418,000 sq m] of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the RCD responsible for the construction of TPOs at the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be placed in future lots.
At the same time, officials are assured that multi-layer parking will take between a third and a half of the area.
Take the garages as an example.
Let's say the garage, which is 258 machines recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So for the parking lot for the 2,000 cars at the Peters-Rhysmowski, it'll need about 80,000-squares--
That's less than a third of the stuff they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go to every bus parlor.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMAs.
If railways are built at the stations and stations, the remaining sites will be occupied by metropolitanists.
They also promised that there would be many - functional objects - including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
In fact, journalists were recently told in the Department of Property of Moscow that they were drafting a decree that investors would be able to apply for a TPO site directly.
No contests.
Because it's because transport is a priority for the city.
The ideal TCU is, for example, the Garvard Station in Boston or \"Spain\" in Toronto, sure Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend to the subway level and the approach from the subway to the tramway is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are throwing themselves in extremes.
Either we don't have anything to build or we'll blow off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser suggests that extremism be equated with the insults of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of citizens' patriotic feelings against the provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia, suggests that the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activity should be compared to those of five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Lézvez, such legislative amendments, prepared by Mr. Oleg Mikheev, the Hindu Energy Committee, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and to the Government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional connection of the person to the country of which he is a national, characterized by love for the country, responsible for her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Miheyev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of the formal characteristics of State power - flag and coat of arms.
According to the Parliamentary view, however, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by State symbols and other forms of disrespect for our country, has not been sufficiently developed in Russian law.
He cites, as an example, ongoing discussions every year in the canon of the Day of Victory, where some media figures have been able to question the heroic feat of the Soviets in their fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the major public festival, Winning Day, May 9, a real vachanalia unfolds every year.
Practicing in a sense of urgency and an alternative view of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I think it's so unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the foremost - spirit - nation - outraged by Oleg Micah.
In addition, Miheyev says that patriotically minded people in Russia are far more than religious people, but the law is to punish the feelings of believers and to insult patriotic feelings can be practically impunityd.
According to the people ' s elector, it is necessary to compare the insults to patriotic feelings of extremist activity and to write in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill punishes the abuse of patriotic feelings, ranging from 100 million to 5 years of imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Kokimbo in central Chile, and is transmitted by the Reuters Agency.
The outbreak of the earthquake was in the ocean 10.7 kilometres deep and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, specified on the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
The dots were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 in Moscow).
There has been no reports of casualties or damage caused by underground shocks.
As a reminder, Chile is located in one of the Earth's most seismicly active areas, so earthquakes of varying degrees of strength are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
The 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused by it resulted in the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in its history, with a magnitude 9.5 recorded there in 1960.
More than 5,000 people were killed as a result of that disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace case to be considered fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, reported on Friday that the Greenpeace activists case would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we have heard all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws” said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Era.
There is a French citizen among the detained Greenpeace activists.
Like the rest of the activists, Pierre Pizan is charged with blasphemy.
- I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen - I quote Mr. Ero, RIA News.
“Our country is unable to support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to break laws,” said Dmitri Medvedev in turn.
He said that any structure that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, was dangerous.
He stressed that these objects, as a powder barrel, and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, conveyed the news to RIA
The United Nations has announced new targets for overcoming poverty
The United Nations must work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in moving the sustainable development goals forward from the 2015 MDGs to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of the evening.
These were included in the outcome document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am glad that UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the universal goals of sustainable development, the CUR,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to take advantage of the authority given to me by the member countries to translate our vision into sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are rising as a result of conflict among influential people
Under the upper view of the statues of Zamora Machela, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to scan slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace returned; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sus, executive director of the investment company.
In fear of her country’s future, she changed the business suit into a T-shirt decorated with the \"We Demand Security\" in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday to the crowd in the Capital Area of Independence.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo have been reported — one of the worst clashes since the Armistice was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to face a full-scale conflict again, but recent developments have caused foreign investors and locals to get nervous.
The rates are high for a fast-growing economy, as opening huge shelf stocks of gas and coal fields in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Annie of Italy and Anadako of the United States.
The Frelimo ruling party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has been the shut-up for recent clashes, attacking its members in Sofala Province, a traditional Renamo stronghold on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels later escalated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times to Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for triggering clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuz has tried to dispel fears of instability.
Guebusa stated to the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt “failure” in wanting to use“ everything left over to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they avoid war.
However, fears arose following the report that Mazanga had stated that Renomo had refused the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he meant that Frelimo did not comply with the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously,” said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that this year's series of clashes have intensified.
“These are the two powerful men (Gebusa and Dhlakam) who are confronted with foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weak movement to get concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of votes in favour of Renamo has been decreasing since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by former member Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guébuza, who should resign next year when his second deadline was over, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” said Mazanga.
It is not clear what Renamo is able to do, but it has already launched devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and motor vehicles on a key motorway heading north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was inclined to ask him if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that cases in Mozambique are not going well,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the Government ' s dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the mediacoop independent media company.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and they must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“No one is concerned about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The series of premier film shows, Art Mainstream, will take place in Moscow.
A series of film shows, Art mainstream, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will be held in cinema - Rolan - from 1 to 5 November, RIA - Novesty - with reference to the project organizers.
Open the program, Art Master, the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerichi-Paris at any cost
This is the story of the model of Maye (Kerici Sam) working in the French capital, which is deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the viewers will also see a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duca - Mebius, the melodramatic bajopik Oliver Hirschbingel - Diana: the story of love - (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the mainstream and the main film of the Kann Film Festival, Life of Adele - Abdeltif Keshish.
The only Russian participant, Art Mainstream, will be the winner of the Kinotavre Festival, a film by Alexander Veldinsky - The geographer of the globe was missing on the basis of Alexey Ivanov's one-name novel.
The main role of Teacher ' s Prominent Failure, Victor Serkin - in the film was played by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also celebrated by the Kinotavra Prize-
Children should study myths and legends as “models of the way of life”, says the author.
The words of the Torah could show that “a gross force cannot defeat a subtle scheme, ” while the legends of King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
Speaking of many myths as “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools”, Crossley Hallland advocates for age-appropriate texts.
“I believe it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralism” of authors and teachers “expresses interest” from children, and the basic ideas are “substantiated” into engaging stories.
Crossley Hallland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote \"The Congregation of Norwegian Myths\" for the publication of Penguin and British People's Tales, said, \"You may have intentions, but you should keep them with you.\"
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that there must be an innate understanding of good and bad.
This must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly defined.
The old principle: show, not tell.
A football fan in Voronegsky is being arrested, breaking up a window in the waiting room of the station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans from the Moscow district were removed from the Grzy-Voronegian station by transport police officers.
When they went to play their favorite team, they set up a drunk debosch on the train.
Young people were taken to the daily police line office at the Grazi station to draft an administrative offence report.
There fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police provided administrative material for them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and began to wait for it to arrive at the station station.
In the half of the first night, fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broken the front window of the front door in the waiting station.
There was a call by a transport police officer and a PRC guard called the broken glass.
They were able to arrest a man who had tried to hide from the scene.
The officers of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs South-East Service are subject to review.
A criminal case is being initiated, and the senior reporter of South-East Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs sent information and public relations on transport to Sergei Olkhovik.
Vital Mutko: Vodomes?
I think we've come back 15 years.
The Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the disturbances at the stands during the Russian Cup match - Shinnik - - Spartak -
I'm a supporter of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFFs.
But we can see that they've taken a bad position.
They're waiting for someone to come and get order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
Clubs should invite their stewards instead of taking the case on their own.
We've now drafted a special government regulation on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it's accepted, we'll take care of this problem.
But I'm still going to invite all the football organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, mole, let's get the law quick.
It's a feeling that they're Bavaria's in Yaroslavl, and all of this is done.
And we're outside observers.
It's terrible to see a stand filled with brands.
And that's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
- I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago.
Snouds can interrogate Russia
Edward Snowden, an American intelligence officer, is not likely to travel outside Russia to give testimony in the cases of wiretapping to the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.
As stated by Interfax, on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions raised by representatives of the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in writing in Russia.
Edward Snouden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
“In that case, he would lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by the U.S. allies,” said an agency interviewer.
In principle, the FRG Attorney General ' s Office could send its representatives to the RF or submit written Snouden questions, adding the source, adding that the issue should be worked out at the inter-State level.
Previously, German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, a deputy, reported that Edward Snouden was ready to testify on the audition by the United States intelligence services of the chancellor of Germany.
Snouden stands ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in German territory.
The CIA's ex-worker made it clear that he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S.A. had blocked all his movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
To that end, however, all the conditions for his arrival had to be clearly identified - Euronews told Strebel.
Snoudena's lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the source's statement, Interfax, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information on secret operations to U.S. surveillance services on the Internet.
Snouden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities who had charged him seriously and stayed in the airport's transit zone, Sherametievo, prior to August;
On the first August, Snouden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a year and left Sherametievo on the same day;
Yesterday, American attorney Anatoly Kucheren said that his client had gone to work in a large Russian company.
An NSA tracking Angel Merkel last week told German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor's telephone calls began to be heard by the Americans back in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing these information, stated that Merkel ' s surveillance of the laws and sovereignty of Germany violated.
The ponomarov left the just Russia
A Member of the State Duma of the Party, Fair Russia, was a member of its division in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, and submitted an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the Parliamentary, he submitted a statement to the party ' s New Siberian regional office.
According to her statute, this automatically means that the Ponomarov has left the ranks of prodigious--
We're sitting, drinking tea...
“Some people want to see a picture of Elijah Ponomarev putting a participle on the table — but that is not so crucial — the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarov noted that he maintained good relations with the Regional Office of Directors*
However, it is not the intention of Deputy Minister Ilya Ponomarev to relinquish his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not exit by law.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party, Fair Russia, appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valery Zubov would come out with him from the SR, but that information was soon refuted.
Japan will discuss with Russia the question of the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fumio Kisida, met with Sergei Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“Courts would exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, on issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty” said at the meeting of Kisida.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japan's Prime Minister Sinzo Abe had visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and more bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are being held in Tokyo today demanding that the lands lost after World War II be returned.
Cars are driving across the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker reports: “Return the northern territories.”
The police don't stop the protesters, they keep the noise level running.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be taken to say that New York is the birthplace of a studio comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an austere artist, Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to share jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fae's innovation has over time caught up with other, most recently, the New York comedy festival.
Founded and curated by Caroline Hursch, the founder of the Carolinas' Standad Club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these hedliners started in Carolinas, and then made more progress, reached a level where they are already too famous to speak at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as \"Standup for Heroes,\" an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among the others in Bruce Springstine, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has expanded with the expansion of the festival.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, through a show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in the comedy show on a little-known cable TV channel (the \"Liga\" on FXX on fantasy football) and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the acting room both in the Saturday evening on live and in the Portkeys and Rest Zones, although she is most famous for the series of virus videos called the Marseille Rock in the Bots.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young self - centered comedians (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jesellnik, a wicked, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
David Steinberg's interview with Larry David will be one of the highlights of the festival.
Steinberg started as a standup comic, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal comedy story.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely a central part of Larry’s work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked through a window between the two houses and thought, \"That's when I'm completely out of money, maybe I'll live here.\"
Pakistan authorities have begun negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistan authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban
This was reported by the British Embassy, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, visited.
The head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British vice-premier Nick Klegg, with which he discussed the relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and the economic reforms in Pakistan.
The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement by the Pakistan Embassy in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan ' s Constitution - and that diplomats would be added.
The Pakistan Taliban (Tehrik-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-western regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistan Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Previously, the Islamic Government had attempted to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would only be negotiated if the authorities were to take troops to permanent locations located in the Taliban areas and to release arrested Islamists from prisons.
Navas Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when concerns over large stocks were overshadowed by a message showing that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining strength.
The U.S. grade of oil in December was 14 cented, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later in the morning for European time in electronic tenders on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract went 39 cents, resulting in a 5.8 per cent drop in the price of October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy on Wednesday stated that the United States reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks more than 25 million barrels had been stockpiled.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China ' s economy can continue to gain strength after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The Brent oil, also used by U.S. petroleum companies, has gone 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Chief Coach-Colorado-Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release Semen Varlama from the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, to express his confidence that the recent night behind the grid did not break his confidence in the Russian, conveys from Dallas sorcor-SE to Natalie Schmelev.
And what are we waiting for?
Of course, we all care, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be helpful to him to get out on ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show us his normal level.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't affect the gate's air conditioning?
We'll see today.
Of course, our players will support Warley by helping him guard the gate, as in previous games of this season.
Chief, no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court is resolved in this situation.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: a warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism is not good for life in Siberia, RIA News correspondent came up.
People who have totally abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they are not allowed to carry winter without loss to their health, and no thermal tomatoes compensate for them by considering newly trained dietitians and doctors polled on the eve of Vegan’s Day.
Drink butter with litres
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, diet doctors are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, such strict nutritional standards are at least not beneficial to health.
A total loss of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant.
You have to have at least a milk or eggs in your diet, a sure dietologist named Marin God.
It gives an example of a fish containing the indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
The most abundant vegetable oil they have is linen.
“ It’s a dietitian to get the right amounts for the person, ” says one dietitian.
The medical profession is confident that Siberians need to pay special attention to their diet in winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
High food requirements are being placed in our realities.
To keep your freezer from freezing, you need a high calorie.
- If a person restricts himself to animal products, he or she may need to take out of that calorie, - says a specialist.
This is agreed by the nutritionist Olga Posyak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way to go.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people want to have a hot soup, not a cucumber, but a hot soup, or something else, and they want to explain their position to a doctor.
She said that from what the vegans can eat, various herbs, crumbs, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is certainly not enough to be fully nourished.
According to the Gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, anthrax in the body only sufficient vitamin levels from mid-August to mid-September.
The full shift to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when temperatures can change 30 degrees per day and snow is in place in my day.
The body needs energy to live, and that's fat first, the doctor says.
Doctors point out that veganism is particularly harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children are growing, and they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we give them little.
The pregnant people also need increased protein, vitamin and micronutrient content on the menu.
The giants lack them, and they are certain of God.
Arifulin says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants to play the toys he wants to play.
He's got an organism that's already formed, a skeleton, an organ.
Yet, children must be fully nourished.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he will be for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
- The lack of any substance to develop the brain, the eye, the bones will never be restored tomorrow, she says.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter produce in greenhouses and vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and produced in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients that are needed than the open ground.
“ The quality of the food is not - it says God.
Arifulin also notes that vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
In some cases, producers ’ desire to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
Apples do not become brown on the cut, cucumbers rapidly yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and incomparable - it gives examples of physicians adding that they are likely to be stuffed with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cages.
This is not agreed with the firm of the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, Vera Petruk, a candidate for Agriculture.
She said that full vegetables could be grown in a proper manner and that all standards and requirements in greenhouses were met.
If they try to drive more from a square meter, they will certainly become more frequent and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow fast, they are large, but they are watery and poor, she explains, adding that the issue of quality primarily depends on the conscience of the producer.
The Court suspended the enforcement of the Order of Order and Search in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the New York Police Department's \"stop-and-find\" programme and suspended the judge's case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Sheindlin would be suspended pending the outcome of the City's appeal.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which he carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police to change the practice and the training programme associated with it.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it violated the code of conduct of the judges of the United States and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and official statements providing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unduly addressing black and Latino people under the “stop-and-find” programme.
It appointed an external control to oversee large-scale changes, which included policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test television-based video cameras in police stations where most of the detention took place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of the people on whom the cases were discontinued after the police inspection.
The debate on the appeal of the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics have been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The “stop-try” has been in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are Black and Latino.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Supporters of the change in the \"stop-and-find\" programme in the New York Department of Police say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, shape a more robust and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the police's fighting spirit rather than crime, result in unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions by reducing the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that it continued to put an end to the practice of “stop-and-find”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York Police had stopped people.
A pedestrian area was opened in the Treyakov Gallery area
There was a new pedestrian area in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Metro-Novokuznetskaya station to the Balloon Square.
Street torches, flower beds, benches, schoolrooms and toilets were installed, and deaf charges and illegal advertising were removed.
In addition to the Klimensov and Lavrushin alleys, which had already been pedestrian, five streets were closed for vehicles, the Ordinian impasse, the Big and Small Tolmacheev Alley, the Kadashev Coastal and the Balot Square.
There are no restrictions on the traffic movement on the streets of Marosek and Petrovka.
At the Friday Street section, conditions for pedestrians from the lobby of Novokoznetsk to the Clemento Street have been set up without removal of traffic and cutting of the carriageway, and is transmitted by newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third Galleries, the Temple of the Clergy of Clement of the Pope of Rome, Museums, Libraries, Monuments, and others.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Coats and the Kuznetsky Bridge were entirely pedestrians.
A large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, decided to close the cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to a phone break to check confidential messages
Former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “the breaking of the telephone, surveillance, and counterweight” in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke’s novel, which was then held as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, Royal attorney Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005 the News of the World had received inaccurate news that Clark was meeting with Hannay Polby's “enlightened special councillor. ”
The paper asked private detective Glenn Mulcaeira to break Polby’s voice mail and kept her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice mail, and the court heard her.
“The prosecution is of the opinion that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not one who will stand by someone at home hoping to catch someone, he is a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspaper News of the World used three ways of investigating stories: breaking up phones, tracking and fighting.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently he knows about the second, the tracking, he just needs to.
What about the first one?
Did he know of the breaking up of the telephones?
He says no, we say, \"Oh, yeah!\"
Hearing of Clark's novel for the first time attracted the attention of the News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, \"Don't waste time, she's with Charles.\"
The tape tape from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkayr's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found notes on the private detective computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, her grandmother and grandfather, Ms. Polby, received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Edice.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Törlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coleson said, \"I have a story that we're planning to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to discuss with Charles.\"
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's participation in this story was in the same scenario as that of other influential people, such as David Blancte, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanchette about the affair with the married woman while he himself had been dating Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coleson and Brooks deny collusion with others with a view to breaking telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Törlbeck, and Wezerap confessed to breaking their phones.
Snouden expresses his willingness to communicate with the authorities of the FRG in the audition case
The CIA expert Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the FWG, hands over RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented a representative of Bundestag Hans Christian Strebele, through whom Snouden transmitted a message to the German authorities.
Strebele had met Snouden in Moscow before.
Four people were injured by a fire on Tver Street
Four passersby were injured by a fire in a collusion in the central Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, the passers-by was hit during a fire in a smokey underground crossing.
According to RIA News referring to Paul of Lebanon’s capital fuel and energy department, electricity has now been completely restored in all homes in Tver Street.
A fire in a heat collector near house 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
A heavy smoke came from the hatches of the torrential sewers, and the underground crossing at the Armenia store caused a dizziness.
11 houses on Tver Street were destroyed as a result of the fires.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was destroyed.
The United States cuts the food allowance for the poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month.
From Friday in the United States, the financial security of food coupons known as “foodstamps” is declining as the relevant State programme ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be set at $36 per month less than previously told by officials.
That'll affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters agency, in fiscal year 2012, the average benefit per person was $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States have increased to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued in fadstemp, a name that has been used since the previous days when they took the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress demand further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
The owners of food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will result in lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue on how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard released her 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
WoW Insider reports this.
According to him, the game was made available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers point out that at present only those users whose accounts are part of the United States service can jump.
It is also not yet available to Russian users.
According to the media, Blizzard’s version of the PC is not exactly the same as the original game.
Sundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came out on the SNES console.
His events were unfolding on the planet Tuole, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
On one occasion, the dark ruler of Sarlak decided to kill the bright King of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight with Sarlak's hasteners and to protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its name was changed to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There'll be new assault rifles in Moscow's metropolitan area.
But they'll sell tickets to passengers, not for money, but for sitting.
One trip of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger at 30 visits.
The number of visits will be calculated using modern technology, reporting to the ITAR-TASS with reference to the Russian Olympic Committee press service.
The first unit will be installed at the Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
The presentation of new ticket sports will be attended by Alexander Zukov, President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, and by the Olympic champions Alexei Nemov and Elena Zaladikov.
The National Security Agency recognitions reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to surveillance of the State
A warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV was hoping to find the antennas of the listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the U.S. was not using external intelligence “to steal foreign secrets for the benefit of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snouden, a contract servant who became a discloser, began publishing his treasure chest of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained access to data stored from United States cloud service suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, were paranoiad by surveillance companies to new altitudes.
The last drop was the news that the Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been heard for perhaps about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe is likely to be the target, then, of course, business leaders are also the potential targets.
Snouden made intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies evident.
I think it's possible that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi Association, representing Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial spying and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All documents revealed by Mr. Snowen still had no evidence that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are sceptical.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Platner, president of the German software provider for SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, which were known by Snowden's discoveries, was a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China was the greatest risk of surveillance.
There has been a major shift in cloud technology, where European company managers have come to realize better that data stored in the United States are within the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the U.S. cloud drive after unscrewing the American Prism data analysis programme.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that hasn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction”.
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are only proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What is happening is not surprising.
He always happened.
“This has been a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, director-in-chief of the chemical company BASIC.
Americans are spying behind us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to boast about the responses they have taken, because it can give the enemy an advantage.
Large companies have long thought that taking a free flashlight to the exhibition or leaving the laptop unsupervised in the hotel room is at least inadvertent.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automobile Company, said that for many years it was standard practice to collect mobile phones before meetings of the Board so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitution Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently released.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to debris and surveillance.
In Germany, many similar companies are world market leaders in their specific niches.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The United States has warned its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in the second set of violators engaged in economic intelligence hacking, after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that, when it comes to economic espionage, “Frenches are worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency, DCRI, reportedly stated in an interview this month: “The services know well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying for their allies.”
The parents of a Georgia youth who died on “stupid chance” believe that their son was killed
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside his middle school sports mother's turned down, believe that their son was killed, and a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia State, was found on 11 January in a vertical mat attached behind the stands in the gymnasium in his high school gym.
Investigators of the Loundes County sheriff's office concluded that Johnson had died by tragic accident, but a 17-year-old family contests this.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They think it is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics and to common sense,” said Kramp.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or the people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to them in a corpse bag,” he said.
American attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they come in.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I hold the view that there is sufficient ground” for an official inquiry, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the primary autopsy had shown that Johnson had died as a result of “position asphyxia”.
According to Moore, however, the second autopsy revealed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Loundes County sheriff ' s office was not available for comment when he was addressed on Thursday.
The South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to publish all the video recordings of the surveillance cameras that the investigators had seen.
The parents of the teenager said that they hoped that the video recordings contained the key to telling him how he died.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the United States Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff on food allergies among children and how to help with an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline supplies — most commonly for injections — of EpiPen’s automatic medical syringe — to assist with potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to supply adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say, \"It's as if something is sticking into my tongue,\" \"the feeling that I have hair in my tongue,\" or \"a tongue of a pinch.\"
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undetermined gender”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sex.
Newborns will no longer be required to attribute male or female.
The new law does not require parents to refer to any gender of such children, allowing parents to designate gender as “undefined” or “unestablished” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the sexual treatment of newborns and to counter the discrimination of intersexual people.
One intersexual person, according to BBC, said many years later, \"I'm not a man or a woman.\"
I'm going to stay with the Doctors with a lousy piece of bruises and scars.
About one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as “sexual abuse” — a congenial term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seeds) or unusually developed outside sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification is still insufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use and assign all available information than to wait for and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before performing the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign gender without an operation and then see how the identity is developing.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why.
It's a mystery why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as distinct from transsexual or transgender, because their condition is not related to gender, but rather to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female, and is typical of either simultaneously or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body weight, primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Gender bias boys now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first person to be recognized as “immediate”, and held a court of law to maintain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F to X, that is, intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news issue on Channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove a “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed opposition to German law, stating that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we turn two more tables of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would have preferred to have children set up gender at birth.
“It is difficult and easy to grow a child, especially if you do not know the sex of your child, ” she said to her parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called Hermaphroditus, named after a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw gender as a letter that could be erased and then painted again.
But now many argue ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that doctors sometimes make wrong choices without knowing how a child will perceive gender when he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, this was called an urgent psychiatric accident,” said Drescher.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to deal with children with intermediate-type genetics was suggested by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who thought that gender was easily changeable.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents grow in children — interact with the genes and hormones of a child, determining whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He suggested to the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during negligence, to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not,” said Dresher.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these gender-change operations claimed to be “satisfying”.
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with male chromosomes XY, but intermediate-type genetics.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” by a man.
Soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s outer sexual organs and eggs were surgically removed and reared as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
\"I knew I was not a girl,\" he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned a vaginoplastic.
But while he was depressed and aware that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a breakdown in sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, getting the injections of the testosterone and removing his chest.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he is acting to protect others in an organization called Interface Project, in an effort to bring about the perception of intersexual people.
But Ann Temer-Mettis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “incentifies labeling and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an uncertain gender,” she said.
We're afraid he'll help me get me involved.
We think it's better to assign a male or a female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will prove to be, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temer Mettis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose for a third sex”.
“Aging people should be able to make their own decisions on formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its attribution at birth.
It is a struggle which small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a Ph.D. mammologist from Pittsburgh who has a sexually disturbed daughter who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called \"a complete insensitive syndrome for androgens.\"
Since her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female traits.
She's got a weight, but she's got no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29 years of age, Kathy is married and goes to the children's mental school at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make haste decisions on their own,” said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, and some time before they write “men” or “women's”.
In that case, you're fine — you raise a child, you love a baby.
You have a wonderful baby, and you're happy.
We don't have to rush into surgery, which is irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that parents are driving because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing, ” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which gender is more comfortable with him or her — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to decide on their own.
The Chicago Gate, Nikolai Habibulin, emphasized that he understood that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russianman, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of Yasrebov, Habibulin first missed six Tampa Bay Sabbaths and then four from Ottawa, and the second game replaced it after the fourth missing hit.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I failed, bringing the words of the Habibulina to CSNChicago.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think we should approach them like a game, and try to achieve a better result.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been encountered.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel good about training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into a snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The gatekeepers don't think I'm so alone, they always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gates.
I'm still working on myself so that I don't miss so much shit.
It's great that my peers support it, but in principle, it's easy: I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
The plane bus turned over on Alta.
In the Rubzov district of the Altay region, the PAZ flight bus was turned over.
As a result, 13 persons were reported to the MES regional office for the injury, according to the updated data.
Previously, 10 victims were reported to law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the department, the accident occurred about nine o’clock in the morning on the road to Novonikolaevka Vishnevka, 1 kilometre from the Lononikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus trailing from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all suffered from different degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtszovsk City Hospital No. 1 and two were hospitalized at Rubtscov.
Beards expect SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects to send Superjet 100 to Europe after installation in Latin America and Asia.
“We hope that in total we will get more than 170 copies of similar sort of fixed-wing aircraft.” Interfax brings the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, who spoke to him at a press conference with Prime France, Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
- I hope he'll be put in France one day - stressed by the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Suho-Citizen aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is based on modern technology and offers high quality and comfort standards in a segment of 100 passenger seats.
Dneproprietary energy has begun a unique rescue program... the nest of the aist
To bring the peasants to the court, the villagers on the high table set the wheel off the floor, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
These special pillars have long been abandoned, so the Aists have loved the pillars of the electric transmission lines, the interwoven branches relying on wires, and the avid house is still secure.
Anna’s grandmother, at whose home in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district, has been living for 20 years as an astute family, has begun to observe her nest sitting in spite of the efforts of her inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already in between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity that the family of anaists who nested at the back of the yard every year have been taking out and feeding three or four of the birds in summer, but they don't want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds went to the warm edges, Grandma Anya called in the Kingdom RES, which has a support.
I didn't even expect it to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, the technical director of the DDT-Dneproblenergo, Sergei Beresowski.
In fact, there was corrosion on the guides that were found inside the nest, measuring between 150 and 200 kilograms [150 and 200 kg].
At any given time, birds could die of electrical decay.
And the locals were at risk of losing their light because of damage to wires.
Linear monitors have therefore started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Helped by ornithologists from Dnepropetrov National University, who developed a nest transport scheme.
They did training for district netizens.
A well-known dnepropetrov ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised the energy sector at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that more than 50 buildings were located in the disaster area -
Special metal platforms like crows have been drilled to reconstruct them.
The foundation was covered with wreaths and then carried over the old nest.
According to experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Even then, the Aists will have their own houses built.
A month ago, the first nest was renovated in the village of Peschanka of Novoskow district.
A new iron - resistant column was placed next to the electrical system and was placed on it with an old, nested platform.
The whole operation cost nine thousand gruvens to power.
The same newcomer was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov in the backyard of my grandmother Annie.
Here, the platform was set up in a previous location, only to be held up over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartments are under major repair.
By the end of the year, four more nests in Pokr and the Kingdom regions of Dnepropetruzch have been awaiting the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
In the days of the district, the sad news of the Apostolic Church, the opening day of the pheasant hunt, was shot by poachers for entertainment by a lazy family on a local pond.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people at all; they were fed and wronged by the natives.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and four of them lay dead on the water.
At present, members of the Apostolic Police Council find out who shot birds in the Red Book.

Communication: Obama's election headquarters considered the Baiden exception in the case of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s immediate advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton’s nomination on the 2012 electoral list.
This opening is the most vivid sensation of all the expected 2012 Mark Halperin and John Hailemann campaign \"Stawks are doubled: the game has changed 2012 \"
The Times received a copy of the book being prepared for publication and reported on Thursday evening that the President's immediate assistants had carried out “wide-scale research in focus groups and public opinion interviews at the end of 2011” to assess whether Baiden's exclusion could help raise the hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political observer, The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the Pre-election Staff and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration Bill Daley, to assess the effect of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago Pre-election Headquarters and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six of the President’s immediate advisers — including Daley, Obama Jim Messin’s former head of election headquarters, and David Axelrod and David Pluff’s former senior advisers — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book “Stawks are doubled” states that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their “close personal relations” but eventually refused to take that step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not “make Obama a significant chance”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the Administration was really considering the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I actively spoke for many things, and that was one of them, ” said the Daily newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at that time, so we thought, \"Oh, my God, what should we do?\"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test”, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the Electoral Staff had invested enough in the study of whether the dividend would result in a vote.
“The election staff do not spend such amounts on interviews and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had explored the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his then boss of possible shuffling.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President had been “known” for possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama could have known.
Martin added that “The reports have been doubled and do not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensing have reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he considered seriously that Obama was not aware of the possibility of deleting Baiden from the electoral list.
\"Perhaps,\" Martin replied.
Do you want the light in the dark of the ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first dark ice cream by means of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop a shining food.
He came to this idea, read a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced Chinese scientists to re-establish glowing proteins.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the eater, increasing the pH in the protein and making it shine.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it responds to the heat of your mouth, that means that the more you lie, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, I'm delicious, says, \"It's an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, when you talk about production, so for £200, you'll get about 2 g of stuff.\"
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it'll increase the pH and the ice cream will start to shine.
We've been testing it over the past few months, and it seemed perfect to imagine him in Halloween, because it's producing such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the meadence of the jellyfish is four times as expensive as the gold.
So every balloon is worth about £140.
But it's pretty good at taste.
Charlie, an experimental company located in Bristol, is famous for her unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of salty gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, \"I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.\"
It's not possible by definition because of the fracture caused by ice crystals, which consist of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach-Avangarda-Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the KCl v-Salavata regular champion match, noted that the micchi had carried out a thorough analysis of defeat from the Magnitogorian-Metalurga-Metalurga-
The specialist stressed that “Avanguard is the need for increased attention to play in defense.
We've watched a video of a match against Magnitogorian-Metallurga - brings the official site Avangarda - the words of Chebaturkin.
- I missed a lot of chess, not a very nice moment.
We missed it because of our mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew the opponent had the performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks since the turn of the game, three of them killed us.
Very good implementation.
Were those mistakes taken into account in preparing for today's game?
Each match and I carefully consider, talk after the game, prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is to make the installation work.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurga--
The game task was completed, and the score was 2:0.
Skipped a goal in the dressing room, and in the third period, they started to get wrong.
Given how hard the game was, there was no point in involving the defenders.
You have to fight the whole team.
Now, Evangarde is a long homecoming game, games are coming in a day, and we've had fatigue on the team?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The key now is to carry out its mission and play its mission.
Hokkay is an emotional game, if you're doing an installation, it's not that difficult.
Because of the new regulations put in place by the Russian Customs office, hundreds of furs have been on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials have promised to provide drinking water and bio-toilet drivers
Hundreds of furs were dug at border crossings on entry to Russia.
This was due to the change in customs regulations.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that a Russian side is in line, and has not previously warned of innovation.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, reports Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of East Customs.
The document of the new model is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Pass points operate in enhanced mode.
“FACTOV correspondent ” visited the border and spoke with long - rangers who were held hostage to the situation.
The prices at the drive-by café store at the Pass Point - Novovazovsk are rising every day, as is the turn of the fur.
The trucks are in a number of rows, each about two kilometres apart.
The Novo Azzsk - Wesselo-Vzenzek Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, goods are sent to the Stavropol Region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, and after the introduction of the rules, Alexei Golovanev (in a photo) complains, who has been transporting cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and insurance for the cargo.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is taken.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1100 - 1300 gruvens).
Those who ride nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) up to $50,000, pay some 15,000 roubles (3,800 gruvens) and travel.
And the rest are stuck -- no one has that big money with them!
Can you imagine that if a driver takes only four thousand dollars to a truck, but as far as Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 RVs) to pay for transit?
There are no conditions for survival at the border, nor are there any drivers, who eat their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but prices like this haven't happened anywhere!
The sellers focused and quickly screwed them up, with 15 gruvens worth a baton, seven gruven cups of coffee, and 25 gruvens a plate soup.
It's just one coffee.
And there's no toilet.
We'll sleep in the steppes, we'll go to the bathroom.
Don't wash or shave...
I can and can't get out of the car for a week, and my wife's got everything ready on the way.
For a week's duration, again, Victor Scottarenko is comforting himself.
Will it only reach my car in a week?
Why do you have one-and-a-half-liter water?
There's 11 to 15 grubs.
What, the bottle's crisp or the water's strain on the silver?
We've got a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, he's steaming the salesman.
Following media coverage, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The authorities of Amvrosiev and Novo Azov, in order to ensure that all those who pass the line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, with potable water, are given the responsibility of the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk District of Sergei Dergunov.
The ambulance crews are now on duty at the crossings.
Biotoiles will also be installed to make people comfortable.
According to the official, the problem of rotation will be solved in the coming days.
As at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been deployed at the international checkpoints of Pass-Speed-and-Novoazovsk, respectively.
-FACTS - will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provoking against the high-rankings of Lithuania and the countries of the East Partnership - a declaration to the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, Moscow has been reported to be going to - speak - the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskite, and to publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhivij, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, the production of an information attack is carried out by the Department for the analysis of the public processes of the administration of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
Eugeny Umerenko, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and who attended the Lithuanian People ' s Party Congress, is the leader of the structure.
A member of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be a participant.
Smirnov, under cover of scientific research, was said to have made regular visits to Lithuania by the end of 2012 and has been in contact with local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smyrnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskite, stated that he knew of the information that was being prepared.
In her view, the most important reason is Lithuania ' s successful presidency of the Council of Europe and its determination to achieve energy independence -
The Lithuanian leader had not previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus stated that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was not treated with sufficient respect;
In addition, Gribauskite accused Vladimir Putin, head of RF, of making only demands for Lithuania -
Recall, in September, Rosprodnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian baby into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not in conformity with sanitary standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the country ' s Government should prepare a petition to WTO.
In the United States, a school principal shot at teenagers.
The principal of one of the American high schools, adolescents, has literally been desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young hooligans threw toilet paper into the house.
As a result, the principal of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several stab wounds and the hand of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the Huligans were not in the Director's possession, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Notably, shooting at civilians in the United States is a terrible trend.
On the eve of the day, a man opened fire in the middle of Ridge Cross in California, U.S.A., right across the street.
After that, the perpetrator took two incidental passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car, and tried to hide.
Previously, a shooting was fired at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked in school, she was a teacher.
shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people suffered: a 14-year-old student and an educator.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, to stay awake late, and to make a masquerade for our area.
Now I'm more like a scraper.
I haven't been calling in my apartment for the past two years and I'm probably not going to be there this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow with regard to Halloween.
According to the National Trade Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for each Halloweenman is the trend.
The National Federation of retailers predicts that $1.2 billion of $6.9 billion will be lost in costumes.
This year's fad of sexy, unsuspecting objects.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they may also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers, or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure the cosmonauts in the Daft Punk style will be in our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the suits that are most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We gave our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only dogs.
Moreover, according to the National Trade Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to the confthet, we don't do it.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Dudes conffet, Twizzlers' chewy candy and Clark Bar batons.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is a great news for 41 million canine-necessary children who have prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — we will not be fooled — eat £90 million during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is some corn-based confeféta; however, according to the National Conditioners Association, almost £35 million is sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion separate corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing that expresses Halloween's essence, like a ghost house.
They have amazing names, such as \"Whistle Behind Walls\" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), \"Woy and Cry\" and \"House of shock\".
Moreover, America has 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses, generating about $500 million in revenue, and those amazing pictures, where you almost described your friend's posting on Facebook and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like sees that picture and leaves a comment like \"the cool expression of the face.\"
And finally, we'll talk about the tucks.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tikwa when we were children, and cutting Jack's lamp is like embellishing a Christmas tree, what we've done since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the tuck fashion didn't start until last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those tucks, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on ticwa.
Jack's lamp, which slowly dries out on your wing, probably came from Illinois State, which grew £542 million this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, please visit Tim and Susan Mathysdon in Napa, California, and try to cut out something of their stick weight at £2032.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website was restored by Ukrainian hackers after the attack
The site of the Ministry of Defence has been restored to Estonia following the morning cyberattack, reporting to the department of the press.
According to Vice-Concern of the Ministry of Information and Administration, Timer Petercop, it was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our experts quickly set up, so far the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the Ministry has been minimized” said Petercop of Postimes.
According to Petercope, it is not long before we talk about who set up the attacks.
“We will have to examine the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents — he acknowledged.
On 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine team posted a live address on the network in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the Ministry of Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
“Rocks away from Ukraine” is a statement made by Anonymous.
Previously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the companies of the Marine Infantry of the Theodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Infantry would participate in command-staff exercises by NATO's Steadfast Jazz-2013 reaction forces.
The destruction of the power force had to close several schools and hospitals
Four schools in Zimbabwe province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children were panicked, and continuing the class proved impossible.
The record of goblins may sound like a fiction of a child to a European, but in Africa this is a serious argument for the school to close.
Adults also fear unclean power.
In the summer, for example, Zimbabwe closed the hospital because the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover race series announced
Inside are raceboards and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communication system.
It is also possible to obtain upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between activities.
Drew Bauler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants in the role of Bowler have changed”.
Some are not experienced racers, but people seeking excitement, adventure, and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to suggest such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of Rally Rade.
We were very happy to design a Defender Challenge car — it would be a very exciting champion.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forcemen are not aware of the grouping - the Brat Circle - - New News
It is described by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports were made that the U.S. Department of Finance Leaps had been placed on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate, the \"Brat Circle\", we looked at all the databases, but we didn’t find such a group,” said the agency’s interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As stated earlier - NE - yesterday, the U.S. Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang - the Brat Circle -
Among them was a Russian singer named Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as \"Grisha\" put it on the previous day.
They coincide with the popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, the creative pseudonym, the place and the date of birth.
Besides Leps, five more people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, a national of Israel, a national of Uzbekistan and another of the former USSR whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, I am sure that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was carrying money for the bandits to order them.
A photograph of the singer is attached to the communication and all of its data are shown that are true.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house on Phuket.
The authorities indicated that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the United States of America has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
The assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that there were no notifications to the singer: \"It is difficult to answer the question whether the Gregory that everyone is talking about is now in connection with the US scandal \" .
All Leps knows is the media.
There were no personal notices to him, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
- And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other hand, amazingly and unexpectedly, she said RIA News.
She said that Phuket Gregory Leps doesn't live, but according to U.S. Minthin, he actually has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour in the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him during his flight to the town of Chargagesk.
A fugitive at the match, Shinnik -
Some details have been learned about the identity of the fan who fled to the field during the 1/16 finals match of the Russian Kubq between the Yaroslavi-Shinniki and the Moscow-Spartakom
According to the head of the FARC, Arthur Grigoryantz, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs data, is a Muskwich.
He's been arrested at the moment.
“ In addition, Grigorianz described how the fan managed to break through the field: ‘ It turns out that the person who called him a viewer went to the ambulance, accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, which was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
Then he pushed two escorts and ran to the field.
He ran from the angle of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran through the entire field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this zone of stewards ' action - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, crossing the Eastern Tribune.
And during that time, riots broke out on the Eastern Tribune and on the treadmills, and the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the Moscow-Sportac CDC decision will hold the upcoming 15th round of the Russian Champions v. Lokomotiv and Zenita, without audience, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were called to rescue a lost pup, which stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous career retreat
Coker Spanish Ruby ran away after getting into a small accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, and she was noticed by a man walking a dog.
The firefighters went down a rope down a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The pup was happy to be saved after fire squads were called to raise him and take him to a safe place after he had somehow stuck 50 feet high in a dangerous retreat.
The nine-month-spaniel Ruby ran away after being hit by a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from his career on Wednesday.
Her husband, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fleppit career in Denholm in Western Yorkshire to be reunited with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They feverishly sought out their missing dog and posted messages on social networking sites after she had escaped from her career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 a.m., a star breeder spotted Ruby, stuck 50 feet high in her career.
The technical rescue unit from the Clekhiton fire station hurried to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a bearing to lift her up the slope.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, \"She was in a position of danger.\"
It was right in the middle of the slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move, nor did she with the muscle during her rescue.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog has been seen is not reliable.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said: \"The souls are very fortunate to be saved.\"
It was likely that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian and found to be all right except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, Western Yorkshire, said, \"Watching for salvation was scary.\"
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had let go and lost consciousness, she'd probably fall.
The firefighters were great.
That was very bold — what they had done.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, of the city of Kitley, added: “We were afraid that it might fall, but it remained there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, a pop star said she was a black vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old hats die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a veteran rocker, and she said, \"He played with me when I was 18.\"
She added: \"It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.\"
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventy-year-old Jagger said that he “categorized that he had ever struck Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “She may be confused with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who came as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, was debuting in the first place this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scottishs a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the Pan-European Free Movement Zone as a condition for EU membership.
The stories of passport control in Bervik and the border with barbed wire along Hadrianov's shaft follow.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone indicate that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around as convenient.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen Zone, continued non-compliance would be a cheap assignment for Brussels to replace what he really wanted from the Scottish.
So it's not a worthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time, I heard a `till' that 'independence means passport control', at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost when we're going through an old story.
Why should independent Scotland obey European orders at all?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the big postwar plan to unite Europe finally stalled.
The Europe project is officially dead with a Eurocrisis.
Parties opposed to the EU, or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency, are gaining strength throughout the European Union.
Even in Germany, the party of Euro-Skeptics “Alternative for Germany” — based only this year — emerged from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in September federal elections, thus effectively driving the “Free Democrats” (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan to establish Federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The severe economy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the ties imposed on national economies through the maintenance of a single currency has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with the excessive budget deficits of national governments — that was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — that German policies and wants to be maintained.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-eminent position on production opportunities as compared to Germany.
The only means of saving money is to cut salaries and public expenditures, which Berlin actively supports.
The current problems of the budget and currency are facing a deeper problem in Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of the mix of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times as much as the U.S. gas.
It's a more paralyzing price situation, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
The devastating victory of U.S. cheap slate gas over the European petrochemical industry will not stop any freeze in the world.
As a result, there is a riot, particularly in France, once the most strong supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's collapsed economy in a state of distress.
The result is the right party opposing the EU, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, has just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling party of socialists to the third.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes — a timely warning to British Labourists that it cannot be assumed that the split in the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
It wanted to use EU elections next year to set up a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the parties against the EU will receive the support of the elections, such a bloc will be able to take the first place in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapidly growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe are being combined to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague European (Sovereign) nation that loved General de Gaulle.
Germany and several economies dependent on it could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe would recover their own currencies.
I assume that Britain will distance itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be overlooked in the cold of the Atlantic.
What is the situation in Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful political movement in Europe, which is aimed at austerity measures, which won an impressive majority in 2011 because of objections to reductions in costs proposed (and realized) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and subsequently a coalition of territorial and liberal democracies.
Scotland would not be willing to vote in favour of independence unless it was to take the measures of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging before
African - American and Latin - American girls tend to be sexually mature before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherage, a journalist specializing in child health and family affairs.
Should the mother be frightened if her daughter begins to develop breast conceptions and frontal hairs at 7 or 8 years old?
At an annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a children's endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents down — usually it doesn’t mean a quick onset of full puberty,” said Caplovitz.
There are obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, the brow hairs, and the smell of the body, which appear earlier among girls.
But there was only a slight shift at the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“As the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the menarche,” said Caplovitz, also the author of Early Sex Vision for Girls: How to Cope With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
It is debated what constitutes actual sexual maturity but considered “premature” when the increase in the breast is accompanied by a dramatic increase in growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or suspended, which means that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress may serve as a basis for analyses of endocrinologist to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or bones.
There are procedures to delay early menstruations and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medical or hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is cautious of drugs, but recognizes that “the sexual growth of puberty can alleviate the behaviour and feelings of girls that they are different from peers”.
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can handle hygiene issues,” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter had menstruated at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs that we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and frustrated that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-founded theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are guilty of milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys — like girls — have an earlier sexual experience.
Caplovitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped study girls aged 6 to 9, which links the body's fat to puberty.
Other evidence confirms this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls tend to be sexually mature before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, early puberty seems to affect everything, ranging from economic conditions and climate to genes.
It is still a mystery that although boys have hair on their face and at their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of ages of age have a hair and a hairline.
“We must be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children’s endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean an earlier conversation than expected,” explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when this happens earlier, the process is a normal part of life.
US Boeing, stuck in Chit, is preparing to leave.
The unplanned United States aircraft landing in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. in Moscow, will leave the air harbor of the city in the framework of the Treaty of Open Sky.
The airport management allowed the flight of the ship, receiving the money for the fuel.
According to the airport reports, the plane will take off to Ulaan Ouda.
According to other accounts, he's going to go to the United States.
It was reported that a plane flying in Ulaan Oude landed in Zabaykalsky because of the fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on board, including a crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
Under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board an aircraft are not entitled to leave the Chita airport, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to exercise border control only at two Russian airports, in Kubinka and in Ulaan Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, and 34 States participate.
Observation flights are being carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, promote the monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capabilities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities earn - the IQ in the U.S.
The live celebrities' rating, with the highest income in 2013, was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But she was replugged by late Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
There's a lot of other famous people who've been working a little bit less than that last year.
Elvis Pressley, the second of the most significant missing celebrities produced by Forbes's year-long magazine, was 55 million in a year, and the line below is written by Charles Schulz, the comic book writer Peanots, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million), entered the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, Igor Gulyev opened the first station.
On 23 October, Igor Gulyeva’s first flagman bet was opened in Moscow.
Igor Gulyev's designer is known to the general public for his wonderful products of lux class mechanic.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashioners -- in Moscow, he finally opened his first stick, which is where the designer set up a dolce vita party.
I am sure that Russia is home to the most beautiful girls.
That's why I'm especially glad I opened up a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
It was with that words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted... to imitate the models he looked at!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are placed on horseback
A bitter dispute broke out between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long voyages, a back tone for heavy confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The resistance revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-distance flights to the class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, with the amount of space assigned to them playing a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by the Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would include a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the eco-class salons, but its main US competitor, Boeing, says that this must be decided by the airline.
The resistance is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of the larger versions of their two-dimensional long-range aircraft and potentially record orders are expected at the 17-21 November event.
The rear of the plane — especially if 9 or 10 in a row — is at the centre of allegations of the cost-effectiveness of the new mini-aerobics projects.
Boeing states that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 persons based on seats in the economic class more than 17 inches wide, arranged 10 in each row.
Airbus says that its competitive version A350 will carry 350 persons in the economy in seats 18 inches wide, 9 in series.
Giants of the aircraft often exchange technical strikes through advertisements in the professional press.
Airbus is now approaching the public directly in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be a leader with over 100 orders.
She has recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could begin, showing to financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant drawn to each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers long-lasting flights on seats that are more narrow than those of regional turbidity aircraft,” said the airbus sales manager John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people get weight, but the plane seats haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Broadcast Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, the weight of an average American male between 40 and 49 years of age increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The waist of an average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor follows the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist grip of those recently called “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus said that a study had been commissioned to indicate that an additional inch in the width of the seat improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests airbus figures in size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere with how airlines strike a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
She said that research shows that the convenience of the living room is not limited to the width of the seat.
“It is really about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said Kent Craver, expert at Boeing.
They don't want us to decide for them what will make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the area by side, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a flight order race estimated at least $700 billion at catalysing prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As the Reuters agency first reported in July, the location of seats is precisely what warms up competition in the fight between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent gain increase in one place in their last two-dimensional long-range model compared to the market leader in this segment, a 365-placed Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of 777X's 10-place rows with the original 9-placed sequence of a constructive solution of 777.
The cost-benefit is reduced when compared to the 10-placed component currently in use.
“The reason Boeing does this is to press more seats and make his plane more competitive than our designs,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus Passenger Comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that elephants with full 10-place rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense landing, which may go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The average width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, commercially speaking, the Airbus proposal is threatened by the 777th model,” said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't supply chairs, but they offer a suppliers directory from which airlines can choose.
Globally, jet sellers even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
By expressing their comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight compartment for budget airlines and regional overflights.
Airbus offers a 10-place row A350, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional elephant modifications, offering wider access to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but may distract attention from the sales wave of the 777X model.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vaccine that could deprive the cigarette of pleasure.
One dose of vaccines has been able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence for the rest of their lives.
Further tests are needed before people start testing, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to drop out of the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of anti-Nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that weren't given the vaccine were \"slogged\" and it's a sign that nicotine was coming to their brains, researchers say,
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the vaccine, and it can help them get rid of the habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Oleinnikov: One third of Sub-Moscow village settlements are wholly docile
Sub-Moscow's vice-governor Yuri Olenikov stated that almost one third of the villages in Moscow's region are fully sub-dated
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 were received from the budget of the region.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The income share of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the total.
The budget allocation from the regional budget is about 25 billion roubles, says Oleinnikov.
The vice-governor also noted that only three of the urban settlements, Mishti, Unit and Pushkino, had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, which is not enough.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative unit in 88 Pomozkovya settlements is over 70 per cent, with the quality of the services declining, Oleinov noted.
He had previously instructed the heads of the Municipalities of Pomoskovya to consider what settlements needed to be incorporated, merged into the city districts or changed administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to this, the Governor of Moscow stated that in the framework of administrative reform in Pomoskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of mining villages.
There is also a request for the incorporation of municipalities in the Kasher, Solnechnogorsk, Koolmensk, Lubertz and Kottelniks.
This issue will be discussed in cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of Mossolduma Igor Brinzalov also stated that it was possible to bring together within the framework of the forthcoming admreform some 30 village settlements in 12 areas of Podmoskovya.
This is because, of 178 villages in Podmoskaya, less than one third have a acceptable financial base, and 100 have a dative base.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not conceal the great pleasure she has received from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina is now particularly busy with creativity and social activities, she still has the opportunity to get along with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their education, but also to entertain how she can.
In the last week, Diana has reported twice to her worshipers on her teaching talents.
She first put a picture in Facebook that shows her teaching kids how to read.
And yesterday she talked to the fans, and she showed me what Artema and Martha had put on Halloween.
Our first halloween called Diana a picture of her children in holiday suits.
Which is not wise, because they are more than any other Russian boys and girls who are associated with this festival because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe introduce - uncertain gender - in registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born to hermaphroditus instead of male or female to be designated “undetermined”
Parents of a child will have the right to leave the Count - gender - in the certificate of birth unfilled.
Instead of -F - (female gender) or -M - (male gender), parents may write -X - (undetermined) for the time being.
This decision is designed to prevent parents from rushing into actuality, gender.
Statistics show that one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born germafroditus.
Tripodi denies being affected by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the investigator of an investigation into the state's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi refutes the changes in the lease of coastal facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who is secretly in possession of three estates on state land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had been lobbying for several state ministers for an extension of the lease contracts for Serkiular Ki, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and a café without going through the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret participation in the real estate following the testimony given by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be put on open competition.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the leases for businesses at Serkülar Ki, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million per year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competition.
He denied, however, that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, had strongly recommended a change in the Government's rent policy.
The ICAC's deciphering of telephone conversations included discussions in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, the senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports following Mr. Obeid's work in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question discussed during these telephone conversations the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie Mr. Tripodi.
\"No,\" replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was under discussion, but that certainly wasn't it.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official interviewed Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
He didn't specify what it was for, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the aim was to rocket Russian production SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air raids on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 may be tested for “substitution”
The “full” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it proposes an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
A paper submitted by the Government to the discussion was published today, while former Labour Deputy Maxine McKue criticized the Government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia's neighbours.
“Dear statements of the type — foreigners — at the end of the line — and “the start of the work of Australians” constitute a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market,” she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labour that had to be protected — and if some in the region saw the rebuttal of this historical artifact, I would not have been surprised.
The document before the discussion set out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are in the process of being examined.
If the criteria of “loyalty” are accepted, the applicant for a visa may be examined for “is the candidate valid under conditions where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person connected with the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of Division 457, as enterprises with the intention of sponsoring a small number of employees have previously taken up employment for hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died allegedly from an infarct after arriving in a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grief - stricken nine - year - old accompanied him on his way to Australia, and from the moment his father died on Wednesday, he was supported by his cousin, who was also on board.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to the hospital of Christmas Island, where he died.
Semen Varlamova’s friend claimed that the hockey player suffered from alcoholism
A friend of the hockeyist Simeon Varlamova Evgeny Vavrinück claimed that he suffered from alcoholism and passed on to the Russian News Service.
- He has no idea how to stop drinking - he stated, inter alia, that woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Calorado Club, for beating a hollyper on the assembly of Russia.
According to her, the hacker pushed her by the hair and beat her with damage to her hands, chest, belly, and neck after the attack.
Barlamov himself came with his duty to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released at $5,000 on bail.
The Court did not limit athletes to movements around the country, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrainyuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed message with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would unite Britain.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was “in awe” of the prospect of working on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Phase is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has mandated HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and to reduce travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of moving from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, \"Our goal for HS2 is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.\"
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face the capacity crisis on our railway network.
But it is also about the transportation of cities to each other; 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmicle, added: “This day's announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmicla to “samely” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Browne said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of producing enormous economic benefits in Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for high-speed railways throughout Great Britain.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, generating benefits for all, and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
The nuclear energy costs both but leaves behind a mass of expensive waste.
Scientists recently drew attention to thorium, another radioactive element of Mendelev’s system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that it leaves no waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia are still in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. mitigation measures.
The US Federal Aviation Administration allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read e-books, watch videos, or play their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remained at the Flight Rule.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-book during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers were considering this decision requiring American airlines to carry out a great deal of work to meet the new requirements but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Civil Aviation Safety Office, they also noted that they were considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The Office for the Safety of Civil Aviation Flights does not currently have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is governed by regulations requiring air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety regulations of crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of the utilization of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” said the Spokesman.
Qantas stated that it would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it shortly,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly examine closely the decision of the FAU and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline, depending on the age of their airline.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to mobile radio interference, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manual-laying standards and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms its fleet’s limitations, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronics and smartphones at any altitude,” stated the FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices while landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head hears Cuban notes of extremism
The Anji-i-Cuba football match resulted in political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the fans had burned down the Dagestan flag, and the Cubani Gymn spoke differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramanas Abdulatippov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to appear before the court because the Gymn of the Krasnodar region allegedly called for inter-ethnic strife, in particular by calling for a war with the Basurmans.
Take the Gymn of the Krasnodar region, this was adopted by us in 1995.
It's a shame, and nobody does it.
♪ You're here thinking about your mother's relative, our enemy, we're going to the Bassurmanine fight ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ for what such words are to be recorded in the Gymne, to have some believers on other believers ♪ ♪ expressed solidarity with Abdulatype's president of Parliament, Hisri Shihsaid. ♪
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, from outside the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel attacked Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly destined for Hezbollah -
Today Syria has met an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached under Russian mediation, which prevented the United States from carrying out the military operation to which they had approached this summer.
More details about weapons and what all this means for the Syrian President will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said Assad's regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died from poison gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that was arranged by a friend of Asad Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had broken its declared clean-up factories.
A longer-term and harder task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were counted.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it happens.
He's no longer a Legitimate and has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels even more secure.
His troops continued to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself impressed the cooperative man.
Today, in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Ambassador in Syria had to answer sensitive questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be more easily killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding on.
And it changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation established a separate Ministry of Construction and JKX
Russian President Vladimir Putin has established a new Ministry responsible for construction and JKX and has proposed to head his ex-governor of the Ivanov region, Michael Menu, in the process of personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Meneman at the residence in New Ogarevo, and Menein did not refuse to head the new office.
The Spokesman for the Russian President, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all construction and JKX functions were transferred to the new Ministry from the Minsk region.
Michael Mene - son of Alexander Mee, a well - known Orthodox priest of the Protoir, graduated from the Hubkin Institute of Petroleum.
Since 1995 his political career began, he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergeivo Posada region, and was a member of the State Duma, the first vice-premier of the Moscow Government, the vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Mann was governor of the province of Ivanov.
Slambard owners do well in Singapore, while middle class faces difficulties
In a lombard at Bendemir shopping in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling lays a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
\"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put in there,\" says Ms. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) per month as the administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where households are growing — is that ValueMax, where it is engaged, became the third piecebard on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Loans to jewellery are not just a quick way to get money (S $1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but are also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore’s lobbies usually account for an effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly higher than the 15.4% proposed at the United Overseas Bank office, a local creditor with an affiliate in the same shopping center.
However, lobbies have the advantage that they do not require checking credit capacity or proof of salary and can grant credit faster than banks.
Consequently, millions throughout the region are being treated in lobbies because families feel pressured by rising cost of living and by the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the world financial crisis and low-cost loans fuelled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turned into lobbies to compensate for the decline in incomes as their economies slowed down.
This week Standard & Poor's rating agency indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase in mortgages, as a risk to the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of households ' debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list from 80 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely recovered from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“The fact is, with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to increase their incomes wherever they can”, says Song Seng Wun, a CIMB economist, Malaysian bank.
High prices of gold have increased over the past two years the heat with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the world's 200 bombing sites are gold.
People say, \"The price of gold looks good, let's lay a golden chain of grandmothers and get them back next month.\"
In Thailand, EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the lambard business is such that the ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will fund expansion, using 60 per cent of the $66 million raised this week as a result of equity in the Singapore stock exchange.
While some creditors were critical of the high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the Lombard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Clients lay items they already own, and the monetaryization of personal assets does not increase households’ debt,” she says.
The deposit is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And they are not limited to those categories of people who are in a difficult financial position.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, laying gold slots or Rolex hours, which can yield up to 60 per cent of their cash purchase.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include persons who need short-term money for commercial projects or investments or small-scale businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” she says.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number and status of available health facilities that are important to the population, but the quality of health care provided.
The programme - Modernization of the Tullsky region ' s health for 2011-2013 - will help to restructure our city ' s medical facilities to make it possible to provide an optimal framework for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological, pregnant and birth attendants.
Thus, the association with the horbidie has provided an even greater opportunity to attract a limited number of specialists from the GUS-NGXB to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, and to conduct further hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistics base of the maternity home was significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards became available.
Some 8 million roubles have been allocated over those years for major maintenance, and 112 items have been purchased, amounting to 42 million roubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In caesarean section, the Sell Sear machine is used to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return the baby’s blood, to avoid the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory clinic diagnostics office.
In women ' s consultation, electronic records are in place, and electronic maps and patient history are planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it has been possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, babies and newborns with regional professionals.
The Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The people of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of a series of attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes into one of the Strasbourgn hotels and then beaten and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old formerly a convicted citizen of Chechnya.
Protector - Bavaria - David Alabama became Austria’s best athlete in 2013, reporting an official website of the Bundesliga.
In that dispute, he preceded winter sports, which are traditionally the best in the country.
The second one was Marcel Herscher, and the third one was a skirrel by Gregor Schlienzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the League of Champions, the champions and the German Cup as well as the WEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
Former civil wife of a Peters-Zenita football player, Andrei Arshavina Yulia Baranovsky, spends a vacation with actor Andrei of Chad.
Julia is resting in Italy at the company of actress Anastasia Zaroadny, her fiancée Sergei Slavova, and actor Andrey Chadov.
The joint couple walk photos are published in Instagram by Anastasia Enroad.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrey and Julia.
On 5 October, the Road published a picture of a couple walking around the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Habek - Zenita - Andrey Arshavin admitted to living apart from his civil wife, Julia.
Recall that Julia Baranowski and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003 with three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is dating Alisa Kazmina's ex-model.
Archawin's new friend was married to the company's top manager.
Tasmanian health-care package of $325 million
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania ' s weakened health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not waste its resources.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersec, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “term measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of this island state, the higher levels of chronic disease and the limitations of the system.
The decision on funding for four years was taken after consultation with Tasmania's independent deputy, Andrew Wilca.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Plybersec today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the planned operations community.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract disposal operations, would help bridge the backlog.
There is also money for clinics that receive patients without pre-recording, in Hobart and Lonseston to improve the quality of post-patient care, to train health professionals, to provide mental health services and to introduce personal electronic health-care systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will follow the ideas put forward by the leading doctors on how to better assist the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plybersec.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would work in strict accountability and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive the Commonwealth ' s money, and to report monthly on where it was spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides the services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilky said today that $325 million would be out of control “unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that a federal aid package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state's health system from a critical state,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, Federal Opposition Representative for Health Care, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to a leukoplasty”.
“The reason we're here is that the State Labour Government broke $430 million out of the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government breaks up almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million dollars in it, it's not a good story.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersec to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on an additional bureaucracy.
The Screening of Guillaume Niklu novel by Danny Didero may boast an exceptional statement and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film that took place in France in the 1760s tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocratic woman sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she is extremely cruel at the hands of a lodger who becomes the subject of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never gets down to a trick or a sensation — and that is the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the message could be a test, like a laundromat, for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weaponry, says the monitoring group
Syria has destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions with poisonous gas, declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes have been raging in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also, on Thursday, the Syrian activist group claimed that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A declaration by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, set by this organization based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or “make impossible” all chemical weapons production tools and mechanisms to mix chemicals with and fill in the poisonous gas.
The conclusion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus is yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safir City, where experts believe that a chemical weapons facility is located, as well as a storage site, reporting the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who were tracking losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, of whom 6,365 were children.
On the Government ' s part, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Asad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
There were also 2,202 army fighters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, as stated in the statement, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safire for several weeks with the rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that on Thursday there were victims on both sides but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short durations of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied with what it has verified and seen destroyed all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/refilling claimed by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activity is currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security sites, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, “the abandoned and ... objects of the chemical weapons programme present in them have been moved to other declared sites that have been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to ascertain whether the Safire site was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total elimination of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that all of you have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the monitoring team, Ahmet Usumju, in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been faced by rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, the responsibility of Shi'ite Islam.
With regard to other events, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the centre, said that there was a violent explosion on Wednesday at the PSB site in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger to the Bali terrorist attacks
The 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bomb in 2002 responded angrily to the conviction handed down by the last of the conspirators to be tried and stated that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in setting up explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including a wave of churches across Indonesia during the 2000 Christmas Eve.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they might insist that a person who was called the “sbreaker” for his reputation as the master of the production of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.
While holding back her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
\"I really think he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
He must be in front of the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and that I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive in a parked outside van was launched immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Peddi Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up an explosive bag just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma for a month and had been “murderal” three times as connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the Gema Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the bloody massacre — Amroshi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudri, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this man deserves the death penalty most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after the death of 202 people and the wounding of hundreds, that is not so much.
Patek is the last to be tried in Bali.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where U.S. troops killed former Al-Qaida leader Usama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence data were: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore links between South-East Asian and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
\"He didn't give up,\" said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict is on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin says.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not from their mobile phone)”
The airliners will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk about mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers cannot be expected to change immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAO administrator Michael Weert at a press conference.
The airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and the rules of reference to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Regarding the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” stated the FAU.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They shall not restart until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives “good”.
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing and not turn it on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, an airline whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference could allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and driving has declared the FAU.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Truckmen, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option”, said Glading.
We've become frankly tired of feeling “enacted in school” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection for surfing, e-mail exchange, text messages or data uploading would still be prohibited at less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft.
Thus, there is still no “friendship word” — the intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when the accident occurred — the actor was removed from the U.S. Airlines aircraft for refusing to shut down the device while the aircraft was on a landing trip.
More heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment because they can hurt someone by flying around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAU can lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national expert on CBS News, said that cellular phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know, thanks to FCS, that they can create interference for cellular communications when the aircraft is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by the FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been pressure on the FAUs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Democrat Senator of the State of Missouri Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no valid security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to restrict passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA as being resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disturbances.
The vast majority of liners are designed to make more extensive use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Worth.
Today ' s electronic devices normally emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only emit minimal signals when they cross-list.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded the entire airliner with its electronic books read and flew to verify problems but never discovered them.
FAU Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Aircraft Passengers, said that he felt the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimized.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual pilot reports showing that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to shut down devices during landings in reduced visibility.
The tourist industry team welcomed these changes by calling them a wise step in meeting passengers who are now using a variety of technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the US Tourism Association.
Motor schools will be able to pass driving examinations
Driver tests will be able to be passed by private companies with their own computerized highway.
It is written by Commersant, referring to the draft Government Regulation - On admission to vehicle control -
According to the paper, at present there are only about 30 such highways in Russia.
It is expected that students of such - privileged - the motor schools will take into account the results of internal testing.
In so doing, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give up the first time, the school will be deprived of six months' privileges.
The technical requirements for roadfields contained in the draft Government Regulation have entered into force since 5 November 2014.
The project also contains training requirements for two-wheeled vehicles.
Since 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for category A rights will have to pass the urban test.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers.
Such workers would have to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird thrown in the air into a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, which had been moved by air to the shore after being found exhausted on an oil embroidery in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The landing was placed in a helicopter in Aberdeen last month, followed by the Scottish Office of the Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Hello.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water shepherd is probably a winter North European migrant who fell into a strong wind zone over the North Sea.”
It looks like the bird's out there and was able to find shelter at the oil tower.
He added: \"She was unable to take off again, so we were asked to help.\"
The water paste was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is the elite of Europe willing to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to collect business representatives and determine what changes the UK's welfare and workplaces want to see with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of businesses in Britain by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey would be unexpected to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are stagnant.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on the long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antimonopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives claimed that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now outweighed by the benefits of being in the European trade zone, and even 40 per cent of the major enterprises traditionally the most pro-Europeanized of all companies agreed to do so.
Last and foremost, our survey of business managers revealed that a clear majority wanted Britain to pursue a course of change in contract and relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “important change” that will regain power to return to Britain.
The stakes are high — achieving changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for Great Britain will ensure a 16 per cent change in vote for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the conditions of British membership in the EU.
He also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial union.
The priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in the United Kingdom, and as the results of our survey show, for business, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s normative activities.
U.S. intelligence services listen to Pope's personal phone
The Vatican is under the careful supervision of the United States intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snouden's collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now well under the care of Pope Francis.
His phone began listening even before he became head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was monitored.
What was particularly important in the United States.
The Special Service connected itself to the cellular phones of cardinals who met in Rome to elect another Pope.
The telephones of the conclave’s residence were also heard.
American spies overheard all of the chief candidates on the Holy See in order to prevent an unwelcome figure from appearing on it.
Panorama reports that “the U.S. ear continued to intercept prelate conversations until the conclave was completed on 12 March.
The Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has reportedly been identified as the future Pope of Rome in the United States since 2005.
American intelligence was also behind negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Bank of Vatican.
The Italian Journal writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives who extract information on policies and financial flows continues to work in the U.S. Embassy of Rome.
In turn, the Vatican has made it clear that it's not cared about by an American expert, even if it's happening.
There are no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
Snoopardist for the Olympics specifically photographed
The Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on the city of Sochi on Wednesday, where the Olympic Games will be held.
Nominal bills, 100 roubles.
But on the bloggers' network are already actively ironic about the commemorative note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Purchase on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the bank was found in the photobanks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange repository, where the photo is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megasecurity on January 18, 2011.
Also, it was already used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic note is in the blue and blue ham.
On the one hand, there's the snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, the Olympic stage and the Jar Bird.
The author of the bank note is Paul Bushweev, who won the competition from the St. Petersburg Repin Academy of Art.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered — mining, fristile, and tramp jumps — but eventually a snowboard was chosen because it was a relatively young sport.
According to source - News is close to the CB, the regulator does not care about public opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of a snowboarder with an Olympic note and is now examining the situation.
But Gohawk isn't too worried about the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the press service, Mr. Natalia Nikiforova, stated to the News that all the discussions about plagiarism were ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note would turn right, and the photos on the net on the left, he would specify Nikiforov.
The person on the photo-session for the booking was filmed from different points, then a final image was selected, and a characteristic outside of the snowboarder was selected.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic note, as the artist had received wages for his work.
Experts believe that the discussion on the image on the Olympic bill is very positive.
The knowledge of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion - is considered by the executive director of NP RusBrand - Alexey Popović.
It is difficult to prove the 100 per cent similarity of the image in the bill and in the photobanks, so the claims for intellectual property in this image are unlikely to be made.
For the first time, an Olympic note appeared in China, with the Beijing Olympics issuing a commemorative note in 10 yuan in 2008.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less than beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their claims, the country's consumption of beer will remain at the current level next year, at best.
Although businessmen originally thought about growth.
The year is no longer easy for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Both of these were reported by the head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, Isaac Sheps, President of the Russian Beer Union Council at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, a daily demand commodity in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
There was a public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already fallen by 18 per cent, as the country had seen a significant increase in its regulation of the brewing industry, which produced and trafficking in beer, a small amount of alcohol, and had told Sheps listeners.
No country in the world has such severe restrictions on the beer market, the unpredictable imposition of all new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar visited that many of the legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse were not particularly influential, but new initiatives were under way.
Everyone's pains on beer manufacturers have been hit by a ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“ We lost 35,000 consumers at once,” said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, brewers have two predictions.
Optimistic -- the one that Sheps told you that foam sales are going to stay at the previous level.
Pessimistic is going to fall by another two to three percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen have to get away from mass consumer varieties, to the premium class, beer is less, but it is more expensive.
However, the radical impact of the decline in sales with a small number of alcohols has yet to be seen.
“I have observed that the incidence of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said drug doctor Alexey Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of those who use strong drinks as well as those who have been involved in alcohol - containing tonifications such as Jaguara - whereas a decade ago, drunk - alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford - car factory in the Najlojsk.
As the trade unions say, all dismissed persons have received compensation.
However, the issue of reduction in production in the region is more acute than the problems of workers.
A member of the district of ZakS, Alexey Ethmanov, stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been cut off at the company's factory, Ford.
He said that this happened as early as September: at the time, about 600 people left the factory for a voluntary dismissal programme, which was developed with the organization ' s trade union.
Workers who decided on their own volition were offered several salaries, such as gold parachutes.
Because of this, the vast majority have left jobs of their own volition.
But according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's going to be limited.
However, the authorities did not plan in the next two years to adopt any programmes to support regional enterprises in difficult circumstances - he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
BForde - this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and we'll definitely publish it as soon as it comes.
Talks about the reduction of workers in the Forda factory have long been going on in the Navolesque factory.
For example, plans for the company to fire 600 people became known as early as September.
Previously, the factory had declared that the manufacture of cars had been suspended.
For reasons, the factory referred to the decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblasta declined by 5.4 per cent as a result of nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
U.S. will be able to use mobile aircraft during take-off and landing
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of airliner have been approved in the United States, reporting BBC television Corporation.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the voyage, and new regulations will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Owing to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will continue to be prohibited.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play the games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch the videos during both internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices over the course of the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example, in the United States, it is also possible for Britain to review existing regulations for the use of electronic devices in flight.
Zarussian Mafia - U.S. has completed a new name - - The Brat Circle -
This week the blacklist of the Russian Mafia is full of new names and four companies in America.
The U.S. Department of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli to the Brat Circle.
One of the Russians was a prominent singer, Grigory Leps, who is suspected by the United States of America of transporting money for members of the group.
In the U.S. blacklist of 22 people involved in the Brat Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
The declaration of the \"Brat Circle\" is more about trying to bring together disparate criminal groups -- the organized crime expert and the professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the \"Brat Circle\" reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia --
- I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization - quote Mr. Galeotti United States Center for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelly agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
- If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization - it brings her words to the Centre for the Research of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brat Circle” brought more approaching Russian thiefes into Aslan Usoyan’s law, known as Dead Hasan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zahariya Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dedud Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was assigned to Dedou Hassan as a nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti pointed out that certain individuals were not relevant to Usoyan.
In his view, they had all been brought together rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal over the inclusion of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s beloved singer, Gregory Leps, in the Brat Circle.
Naturally, we expect more information from our American partner colleagues, and this is why he was put on such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a national of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests would be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in gas.
The start of the Southern Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launching of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the Head of Gazprom said.
“Today, a landmark event took place: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline “Southern flow is the largest and most important project in Europe”, said President Gazprom Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The Southern Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The competition between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, which contains most of the Russian gas for Europe, increases the risk to normal routes, officials say.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always eliminated”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Police detained the shooter at Los Angeles airport
The police detained a suspect in a shooting at L.A. airport.
Previously, it had been known that a rifle had been fired in one of the airport terminals.
The police and rescue services evacuated people from the building.
The attacker was shot in a gunfight with the police, and there was no information about his identity.
The police are looking for his potential accomplices.
Several people were allegedly injured during the shooting.
It is noted that Barack Obama was informed of the incident.
Two YMCA staff members were charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission had come to know
Two staff members of YMCA NSW were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 charges against a child care institution worker in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's introductory statement stated that it “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
Chief Executive Director Philippe Hayr asked about one case where YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes and another where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayre told Gail Fernes, a lawyer who assisted the commission, that he knew of the first case, but did not know of the second.
He admitted that YMCA, in its opening speech to the commission, had also been inaccurate, arguing that “there had been an external audit of YMCA recognizing that YMCA was in the front ranks for children's safety”.
The evidence provided to the Commission indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible quality audit evaluations by the Department of Education and Communities this August.
Mr. Hair, who had entered YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed the Lord and had not been able to ensure a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayr rejected the assumption that corporate ethics of YMCA prevented employees from reporting Lord ' s violations in the area of child security.
The officers testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play his mobile phone.
Daniele Okwell, who was led by the Lord and asked for training to protect her children because she was concerned about his conduct, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the leader of the Lord, “very frightening and often difficult to access”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff ' s explanation that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had moved them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented to the council of YMCA New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organization of “the incident with Jonathan Lord” did not “remove the provision of information” by the staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff members to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges had been made by YMCA Director-General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was meant to prevent a loss of evidence, but it was “overwhelmed” and that the decision was not well realized.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during its work in Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, and reported to the commission to Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearings were postponed until 20 December.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
It's not just a manace, it's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundshen had for some time left his job, she had been away from her motherhood on these days and this week’s defile on a special basis.
The months of absence did not prevent her from maintaining her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world’s most highly paid supermodel.
This time she was at the Colcchi's mark-delivery.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting show.
Kind of like I've organized a stylist named Lino Villaventure.
Mark for more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the lux class pret-a-port, the modeler works actively in the theatre and in the cinematograph, the production of performances and the making of costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, over 30,000 firms and companies relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the closing week of the São Paulo fashion.
This is one of the most dynamic industries in the world, with over two million Brazilians working in it, and an annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said that he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
Last night in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of internal politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussions of British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador in a quarter of Middle East peacekeepers.
In answer to the question whether he would have returned to the Prime Minister's office, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, \"Yes, of course, but it's not likely to happen, so ...\"
Chief Coach-Milana-Massimiano Alllegry regretted the failure of the 10th round Italian champion s-Lacio-
The specialist also noted that the failure to start was due to a series of injuries to the lead players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, and it brings Allegri's words to Tmw.
The team played a good match, creating three to four good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let anything happen, Lacio.
In the second Romans, we've been added, but I can't say in general we've lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we completed the task of getting into the League of Champions.
Now we're off schedule, but it's due to a whole series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players with character.
But our composition is good now.
Look at the Kaka that held the high-level meeting.
The experts at the convoys going to Cardiff to fight for the Loshad of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, only a few months before taking his first steps, this young man and his pilot, Shetland pony Toffi, ran through three tour to easily take the lead prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This same pair — of equal growth — received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by Sunnybenko’s Center for Horse Sports in Radri, near Cardiff.
Going out on a general view against the background of men and women in fancy stick hats, he moved his hat back and spent a lot of two-year-old Toffy proudly.
The judges commended Fenton for not having developed innate horse management over a year at all.
And Toffy was highly valued for his appearance and character.
The Fenton gave Toffy his third birthday last March, and he's been dealing with the Shetland pony every day ever since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, \"Fenton and Toffey make a beautiful duet.\"
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second speech with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Very unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Veil in South Wales, follows his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been raising horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, \"The whole public was hit, and everybody shouted out a little cheer and a little shit.\"
He ran across the sand all over the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a great job.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms without mind, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Based on how he began, he will soon participate in the “Loshade of the Year” — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said, \"Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony.\"
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffey for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves to the show-ring.
They appreciate the coherence of the performance of the pony and the factory factory — Fenton and Toffy were the best at the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped out with his attractive looks, and he really looked good in his role.
China’s newspaper’s call for “regime”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued the call for the release of the accused in the libel of a reporter, should be reorganized, reporting the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper of Guangzhou made an unexpected public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a public ownership company.
The New Express now has to undergo a \"complete error correction process\", as the regulator reports.
The “error correction” was ordered by the Guangdun Authority in the areas of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that a New Express newspaper owned by Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports about Zoomlion’s registered exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The leadership of the New Express has been disoriented,” states the regulator.
He states that it has been decided “to impose administrative sanctions on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the withdrawal of his reporter's licence”.
He also “sent instruction to Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the mistakes in the New Express” and recommended that it investigate the situation of newspaper officials and immediately amend the New Express leadership”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for a “New Express”, in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release in the first strip, claiming that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television acknowledging that he was publishing false articles for money.
“In this case, I did damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire news media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he said to the CCTV State Broadcasting Company.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s admissions, New Express issued an apology on the front strip, claiming that the newspaper had failed to verify his reports properly.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extorting confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to speak for themselves.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for Drug Transport, equipped with its own railroad
One of the most difficult tunnels to smuggle drugs between the United States and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves ever discovered.
The zigzag tunnel, which has a length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with unmarked warehouses, making it easier for drugs to be loaded into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs had been accidentally transported through it, as the authorities had stated.
According to judicial records, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when detecting a tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of proliferation.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the collection of marijuana in October, which placed the challenge for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards long with rail tracks running from one of the kitchens in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been raised since November
In Belarus, pensions have been raised since November this year and reported to the BELTA correspondent at the main pension agency of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
On 1 November of this year, an adjustment will be made to the average salaries of employees in the Republic used in the previous recalculation of pensions by 5.4 per cent and the corresponding recalculation of employment pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478-O of 21 October 2013 -
As a result of the recalculation from November, employment pensions by age are estimated to increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The improvement of pensions affects 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The costs of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus will increase by Br274.3 billion per month since November this year.
At the same time as the recalculation of employment pensions last November, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and allowances for pensions will be recalculated owing to the increase in the subsistence budget of the average per capita.
BPM approved by the Government for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 in the amount of BR1 million 47,000 530 at a rate of 2.1 per cent higher than that operating from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum wage, social pensions and allowances, promotions and benefits will be increased by 2.1 per cent as of 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0 were laid down in 2013 for pensions based on promotions
British police have notified Assanjo of extradition
The British police today gave notice of the surrender of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanja, who had fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they gave the 40-year-old Australian an “official requirement to surrender” to the police station, adding that if the requirement was not met, he would be arrested further.
Assanjo threatened to extradite to Sweden for sexual offences after he had exhausted his opportunities under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from that South American country.
Scottland Yard “delivered to a 40-year-old man an official request to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station a day and time of our choice”, as reported by the press secretary.
It continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to bring him possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomats on the sensitive website of WikiLeaks.
Driver driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The car driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howey of Typtree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on track A120 at Brintry on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
In the world court of Calchester Howey, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving permit led to a six-month ban on driving.
Howi also undertook to pay the costs of £90 and an additional fee to assist crime victims of the crime of £100.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to collapse
The Treasury had performed a preliminary valuation of the capital tax, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget had introduced a 7% State tax rate for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to own houses in association rather than as individuals.
To date, the real estate tax in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which stood at Pound708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, has already exceeded the total of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “After an increase in the State tax on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-smoking legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system”.
“But this step could lead to some foreign investors reluctantly buying real estate in London or current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate, the top 5-10% of the price housing market, in London’s rich south-west belt, extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen to a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% annually, but they were overshadowed by an active “emergency market”, with a surge in prices in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog's tail moves and how its mood is related.
Earlier research has shown that contented dogs shoot their tail in the right direction (from the dog’s point of view), while troubled dogs swing their tail mostly on the left side.
But scientists now say that other members of the dog family can detect these subtle differences in tailing and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of their brains to control the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the mixed pouring of the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distortion factors, and we could manipulate tail movements and send tails to the left or to the right”.
When the animals saw that nothing else expressing the dog was moving its tail to the right (from the dog’s tail point of view), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning primarily to the left (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), their heart was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other with those movements.
In fact, he feels that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and not about.
He observes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tail is often one-way linked to more friendly behaviour, and the right-hand side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and depressors a better understanding of their animal’s emotions.
A dog conduct expert, John Bradshaw, a visiting scientist at the University of Bristol veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to test whether the dogs were the left and right.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs would turn their heads to the left if they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right if they looked at a happy dog.
And in another research work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a dog robot when the lashing of its tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behaviour with regard to Italian research.”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robots dogs as dogs.
It might be helpful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and the dogs are not excluded”, he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior may be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concerts in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock group Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffild group was to perform at the Hydro City concert site on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s eye specialist’s illness forced them to take over the show.
This statement by the group was made after it had been forced to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official Arctic Monkeys website, they stated: “After the decision to move the show to the London LG Arena tonight and after the request for medical care, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show to the Hydra site on Friday, 1 November, in Glasgow.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed as laryngit, and unfortunately he is unable to speak”.
The show on the Arena LG in Birmingham will now be held on 20 November, and the show in Glasgow on the Hydro site will be held on 21 November.
All the tickets to these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket owners for any inconveniences they have had.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will re-enter the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in their term of office on 22 February, as declared on Thursday Vatican.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the selection of his successor.
At present, there are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal was 80 years of age, he could no longer participate in the election of the pope — the prerogative of the group of 120 “Courdinal voters”.
In announcing this news, the press secretary of the Vatican, the father of Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals known as the consistoria would be held in front of the San.
“Papa Francis decided to report in advance his decision to convene a consistorial office in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voters' cardinals was likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring back the number of voters to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
Consistency next year will be of great importance because it will be the first to be elected Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is some bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the establishment of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him,” said Valero.
He said that it was possible that Francis would appeal to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in that situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually placed as the cardinal of the bishops of the great adventures, but Francis “is full of surprises — so we don't know who he would call”.
GM cancels out a number of new pics in the United States for seat back work
General Motors Co rebuts nearly 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with the Friday notification from the United States motor vehicle regulatory authorities.
On some of the pick-ups, the front seat may have a defect in the back-facing mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“In the rear of the vehicle, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury”, says a Web site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The recall models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important start of the car in serial production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed peak owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day closure of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as stated by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Spikes of Silverado and 16,503 pickups of Sierra.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama’s voter
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, with hope of a change
He said that Obama had allowed the nationals to lose out on commendable efforts.
Obstruction cannot justify problems with Obama ' s reformed health system website, drone attacks
Obama campaign memoirs 2008 are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the second Harvard University School of Medicine.
I'm reading a terrible sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me at the time of my depression in my high school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called \"The Power to Win,\" and it's a memo about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients at night and go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could take a breath.
The election was impressive, and the leading news programmes were paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept all the papers they could find.
At the White House, a young strategist had to come, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, the support level was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gruesome awakening, like being driven out of the dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I put down my first ballot paper, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of a law on accessible medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the rule “Don't ask, don't say,\" the killing of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party abstraction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and closure of Guantánamo base among others.
But after countless times, when I was on Obama's side of the office, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ended up with the explanations I could provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to be heard by foreign leaders or to be struck by drones against innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of disclosures of misconduct by the Government.
It cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Aulaki, without trial or investigation, or the failure to comply with the State funding and expenditure limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration”.
More recently, it cannot justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on accessible health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
Clearly, the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by events such as the fear of Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have cited above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what's bothering me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I felt that, in his second term, Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard over such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45% this week, returning in 2008 became much more difficult through the book.
That makes me miss many of the promises I've made.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes Clinton's having suffered a deafening defeat in Obama's primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Mt. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over child-care leave.
Milliard's deputy, Clive Palmer, says that Prime Minister Tony Abbota has a conflict of interest in child-care leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This $6 million magnet of the mining industry, which has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to turn down questions as to whether he had a conflict.
A joint Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in deciding to eliminate carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be between ministers and said that Mr. Abbott's daughter would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they receive leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight for a seat from Sanschen-Cost of the Fairfax Electoral District, with a vote of 53 votes after the recalculation.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Francis and Brigitte.
Should these elections be decided two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why don't we have to have a system that we can come in, put our data into the computer, immediately vote and get a score at 6:30 that same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for bulletin notes.
Is that because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use pencils today.
The Electoral Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would take his new work “very seriously”.
The public office involves public service.
“We do not seek any reward other than the gratitude of history for serving this district at a critical time,” he said.
RBS disables two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from operating in its currency division, according to two persons familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global screening by regulators of alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the world's largest financial market investigations with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be suspended during a unfolding investigation, which is associated with a manipulation scandal with the interbank rate LIBOR.
By refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we cooperate fully with the FCC and our other regulators,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the British Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, is granted leave at his current position as the Head of European Spot Exchanges in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European sweatshops in Citi, left on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s instant messaging team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss governor Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, the FCC, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into collusion to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, and spoke to persons familiar with the situation.
Banks view instant messages and e-mails in a few years in search of offences.
News about the audits has broken down in the area of activity, one of the largest sources of revenue in recent years for investment bank trading units, which this year, however, has faced difficulties as low currency volatility decreases the favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation by saying that it is virtually impossible to manipulate a large and high-level exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily currency trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of their domestic platforms by banks means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day that the Credit Suisse bank announced that it had fired one of the traders of its London Stock Exchange division this week, after having caused nearly $6 million losses at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” reported Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health law was constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges decided that separate orders under the patient protection law and accessible health services requiring that citizens acquire medical insurance prior to 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the authority of the Government to tax.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, applied to four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further found that the requirement of the Health Care Act that states should make the Medicaid program more consistent, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, was not unconstitutionally unconstitutional.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have applied to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football's a cause of discord?
In the State of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
The suggestions included banning football in the North Caucasus, because it was a scandal and strife.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled the recent events in Biruljev and said that in order to reduce the degree of tension in society, politics and the media must be adjusted in their comments.
He must have been referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire on one of the television sets if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which had given debate to a summary.
Maxime Grigoryev stated that the events in Turvul - a model conflict that could be predicted - but - there are too many people and institutions answering these questions - and seven girls have no eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism that has long been practiced by Europe, according to the public, has failed and must look for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov has placed great hopes in a new one history textbook.
There is still a need to create a guide to the history of the country's culture so that students in Tatarstan will know that people live in Dagestan, and vice versa, he said.
Gennady Züganov has proposed criminal liability for `calls for dismemberment of Russia' - - If you say in the U.S. on radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison ' .
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to incinerate
As usual, in all cases he accused journalists of taking sick and acute national concerns to public debate: “There is little to be said in the dust of the controversy:
The leader of the faction, the One Russia, Vladimir Vasiliev, also advised journalists to conclude a “chart” and to agree to speak up on the subject with care, and then the same commitments may be made to politicians.
We have about 30 laws regulating migration, and order has been generally established, Mr. Vasilev stated.
As an example, he cited legislation that held regional and municipal authorities accountable for international peace in their territories.
However, Sophia Andrichenko was not pleased with the Act, and there is no clear idea of what adaptation, mechanisms and limits are.
Therefore, the actors will treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel to deal with such complex issues, and there is no means of providing the methodological advice they can use, and the centre does not provide them with the ...
The Head of the Duma State Committee, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the formidable title “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tishkov, who led a similar department in the 1990s, who was later abolished, opposed.
It is sufficient to have a special person at the federal level, a minister without a briefcase, to whom you could turn if you did.
“We go over the edge, the projectiles cracking together, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to speak out together against provocations, and this work should receive valuable information” said the representative of the RCP on relations with society, All-Wold Chaplin.
No neutrality on the part of a State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in its view, be accepted.
Here, Oleg Nilov led the discussion on a sudden path: “More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan have yet to be sought, but they are pushed astray, not on that road,” he said.
“ The wrong road is football development: “The football players are beating up the crowd, and the flags are roasting, and the teammates throw stones at each other....
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There's another kind of sport called rugby...
- They won't be perfect in the world in this form of sport.
No one will play the rugby in the Caucasus!
You'll offer them a kerling!
We need to know the national features, but it's like Georgia's \"Deader\" to propose...
In Jaroslavla, the wild behavior in the stands was different from that of the Moscow club -- during a game with a local club.
Football will have to ban all over the country...
Arthur Grigoryantz, head of the RFS Control Committee, reported that “Cuba is 500,000 roubles fined, and is handing over Philippe PAPPENKOV, a correspondent of SE football.
Such sanctions against the civil society club were imposed on the burning of the Dagestan flag by fans at the rostrum during the 14th Tour's domestic match against - Anji -
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the FPFL.

Against Google companies, Samsung, Huawei sued for Northel patents
The group, with thousands of former Northel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it oversaw at Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion from Northel patents, filed claims for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court of Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help compare Internet search keywords with their advertisements, which are the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC make telephones on the Android operating system from Google, which competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered a $900 million initial price for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the price several times, eventually offering a whole $4.4 billion.
After losing the Northel Consortium Rockstar patents case, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, the determining factor was in part the Motorola Patent Library.
“In spite of the unsuccessful attempt to auction out claims, Google has violated and continues to violate the claims”, says the court.
Rockstar requires increased reimbursement from Google, as he claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes the oath
Mohammed Mursey takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursey promised a “new Egypt” when he sworn, becoming the first freely elected president of the country to change Hosni Mubarak, which was overthrown 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursey was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt, after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,” said Mursey at a solemn ceremony on public television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old American engineer from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that for the most part from 84 years of its existence had been banned by an organization that served as a target for the harsh actions of successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursey arrived with a small courthouse shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time in order to miss his convoy on a usually busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Murcy was mocked as a non-harismal Bratyev spare wheel, his personal prestige had risen sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who wanted to complete the 2011 revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, wearing a blue red tie business suit, the judges in the blanketed wooden panels of the hall where he took the oath.
He later went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing a state hymne, during which he stood on a stand “peaceably”.
There was a military officer, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was met with the slogan “The Army and the People — One Hand, ” which scanned hundreds of students at the university’s main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a patchwork of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursey made a symbolic oath last year on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak took place, and promised to return the powers of the President, who had been deprived of his office to the military council that had accepted cases from the overthrowed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, not before Parliament, as it has been accepted, he is doing the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursey’s tour of Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tumena Manufacturers Association was held at the Jolutor Road Plant.
The event presented a new line for the production of steel-powered electrical pipes.
According to the business director, Denise Gribanov, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 to explore the market for steel structures in the Tumena region.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electricity pipe per month.
It was then decided to change the factory ' s profile and installation of equipment for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million roubles, according to Denise Gribanov.
A new status was launched in October, allowing for an increase in the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for domestic farming, small construction and the furniture industry, and a large profile for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach a production rate of 50,000 tons per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumena region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157, and an increase of more than 50 staff in the plans for the purchase of new equipment.
The company is undergoing retraining and the necessary professionals are being selected from within existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal segment to become up to five millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of production as well as another condition at a rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to be producing pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumena region ' s needs for the products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, referred to the directors of the proceedings and suggested that greater attention be given to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This is also aimed at forms of State support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and costs of leasing it.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidization contracts, shall accept documents from enterprises by 15 November.
The budget also offsets the cost of local producers participating in international fairs.
The budget for the coming year is 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to fairs and 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Funds are reduced to 72 million roubles for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment in the south of the Tumena region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostrovov, this form of support would cease in the future, as the reason for its introduction was to compensate the mining tax that the oil companies had paid in the district budget.
At present, they do not do so, and subsidies become direct expenditures for the region.
With this in mind, the Government has given priority to the direct support of the industry rather than the financing of the oil industry through it.
The budget assistance will relate to investment projects that will be implemented at the production level.
Many business managers expressed concern about the current oil situation.
The value of the equipment they purchased was a competitive advantage for the south of the Tumena region industry, and it would be difficult to compete at the price of Russia ' s middle strip, where a cheaper labour force would be.
In addition, it was unclear whether the new owner of TNC-WR, Rosneft, was still in possession of his business.
The Agreement on the Uwt project expires in 2013 and has not been applied for its extension.
At present, south-west enterprises specializing in oil and gas equipment are unable to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes will be taxed from oil produced in the Uwat region to the region ' s budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new property owner.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social media.
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk has sentenced 240 times to mandatory work by a city resident who has posted an extremist video on the social network, and has reported to RIA News on Friday a representative of the Regional Court press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was on a federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated against him under the Criminal Code of the Criminal Code in order to incite hatred and hostility, as well as to impair the dignity of the individual committed publicly -
“The Lenin District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a 240-hour sentence of compulsory work” said an agency interviewer.
She added that the man had fully confessed his guilt.
Asarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the association signed with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the prices in the country will fall significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He spoke about it during his discussion with the readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by the large number of factors, including customs charges.
With the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should go down.
- This is the case for goods from EU countries - wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
But there should also be no price increases.
So the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a bit in our country, that an association with the EU is a price increase, that's not exactly the case, or that if you say it's not the case at all--summated Azar.
Investigators examine information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media released a report stating that a child in the basement had been locked up for educational purposes by a kindergarten teacher in the town of Biyska.
Investigators are currently looking into all the circumstances as well as legal assessments of the actions of kindergarteners.
After the charge of stupidity, Evgeny Vasileva spoke.
Eugenia Vasiljev, who has been closely focused on the media for almost a year, has never once commented on numerous press publications, both on thefts in the Ministry of Defence and on her personal relationship with the ex-Minister of Defence, Anatoly Serjukov, her poetry and her passion for valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the figure of the Oboronservice case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, he stated: “Of course, the task was exactly one thing: to extract any negative information from me against the former Minister of Defence --
I was blackmailed that I had to testify, or I would be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we prove our innocence.
In victory, we're sure 100 percent.
However, the interview concludes that perhaps the most important thing was Vasilleva had said that she did not care about her taste.
It probably refers to the statement made by the official representative of the UK RF Vladimir Markin that forgery was found in the collection of paintings collected by the staff of the case of Oboronservice.
Among the property that has been arrested are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of the arts, has acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, an art study commissioned by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were, in simple terms, cheap counterfeits,” Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal points?
I think it's just a limitless thing to say to Vasillev.
On the other hand, in one of the 12 criminal episodes she was guilty of, Vasileva stated: “Of course not.
Nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading the people, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's UK RF statement that Vasileva was reluctant to study the criminal file, the staff member's lawyer said that he and his client the investigator was not getting to know the case files -
What led to the revelations of the house arresting Vasilleva, still out of touch with the press?
Maybe she couldn't help answering the bad taste accusation.
Or the rights of the journalist Comsomals, who claimed a couple of days ago that she had fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest - because of reports of reconciliation between Anatolia Serjukov and his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
A well-known military examiner, Mr. Victor Baranets, in his article “Sirjukov back to his wife,” wrote: “Studyers do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more conversational on interrogations,
Previously, Vasileva had taken over some allegations of the illegal sale of Minobona's real estate.

The company updated its forecast of full-year profits and looks forward to record revenues from rest in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism firm now expects its principal annual return to be from $325 million to $340 million, compared with its previous forecast, ranging from $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks were to be achieved, that would be a 12 - 17 per cent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011-2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre earned 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performance, especially on a week-to-week trip to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with a return on our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to make a record high return in a full year before allocating interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually make us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered during the second half of the year, compensating the somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the British Flight Centre business, leisure went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States had offset the losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to make a profit in the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the Flight Centre stock grew by $3 a cent until the $38.20 mark.
On 31 October, Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial Region on the Street of Evlet.
At the time of the audit, the game was in progress.
At the club, there were 24 assault rifles.
Another gaming club was found in Lenin County on Anton Petrov Street.
Twenty game machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Barnaul reports that administrative material has been produced under article “Illicit organization and gambling” -
The tech's been seized.
The evidence will soon be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninian regions of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the offender killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who has brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported by the New Region, in a press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlow State, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were discovered on the day before the day in Kirov district of the Ural capital, after fighting a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential home in the street of Uralski.
Soon the victims were identified.
It turns out that she is a sister, one of them is a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg and the other is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burning apartment was taken off a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the Chief Police Region, Michael Bordin.
The internal affairs authorities have worked out various versions of the murder, verified the alibis of previously tried citizens and persons inclined to do so.
It also establishes the purpose for which women have rented an apartment and where they lived before and with whom they have been in contact.
Schools called for more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onward.
The examination will also present “non-programme texts” to encourage broader reading.
The course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, pupils will have been required to pass a separate language exam, with urgent recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should issue new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject being radically reviewed.
It will amend other major items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the area of OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure for secondary school examinations, a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of course work.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Howv, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system to regain public confidence”, insisting that the school examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year or 3 hours per week for a quarter) than most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore has students for about 138 hours.
While there would be no formal requirement to devote more time to the mathematics schedule, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math examinations, combined with an upward factor in the ranking table, would most likely be an incentive for schools to provide additional education on the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Hayhe tickets will be enjoyed by tourists at 2,200 roubles
Since tomorrow, tourists from Blagovezzzka in Hayhe will start carrying ships on the airbag.
For those wishing to go to China, that means extra costs
A ticket to the puma is traditionally more expensive than a heating tunnel.
AmurASSO reported that the average ticket cost would be 2,200 roubles.
Passing through an increased comfort room would cost 2,800 roubles.
To put it this season, the tickets did not travel; at the same price, the puma took the tourists and the past spring, and a year ago in autumn.
Dmitri Medvedev: RF GDP growth is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the rate of growth of its GDP to be insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, with an innovation-oriented approach, reports Reuters.
We've planned this year's GDP growth in the area of 3%, maybe a little bit more.
It's going to be slightly less than 2% real.
Against the backdrop of recession in a number of European countries, it's probably not very bad, but for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, there must be a higher pace in order to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal credit at a normal price -- that's the first thing they need to do -- stressed the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there's not much doctors -- just one in every 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become the Hero of CNN year.
This person is going to get $250,000 to continue his outstanding job.
During his 21 years, Georges Bwellle saw his father return to life and re-entered unconscious conditions, dropping into hospitals that had not been adequately equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle suffered injuries in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken hand, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could obtain.
\"It's not easy,\" said Bwelle.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first one, but you're not the first one.
Patients are a lot.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed significantly since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the United States ratio is one physician per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could get a doctor, many of them wouldn't be by pocket.
Two out of five people in that country lived below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health expenditures were private.
“The only problem is poverty,” said Bwelle.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also founded ASCOVIME, a non-profit organization that conducts weekend trips to rural areas to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are beaten into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and rode across the area to visit villages in need of assistance.
They don't always have good luck.
Many times they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they come, they're met like real heroes, a party with songs and dances and better rooms that the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a occasion for the celebration, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the feast.
The team starts taking hundreds of patients the next morning.
“We accept 500 people on every trip,” said Bwelle.
They come from all over the county 60 miles [60 km] from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of health care services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may obtain castes, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At night, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are normally carried out in the school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients stand up and go to the post-operational area to free the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitary processing of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work before Sunday morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade’s commitment usually helps to support the village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and to keep working,” said Bwelle.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city tired but proud of their work.
This team, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free operations in the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free operation he had received to treat the grit would enable him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions on weekends and work at the Bwelle surgeon's hospital, she also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second work, he said, that provided 60% of its funding to a non-profit organization; the remaining funds were covered by private donations.
\"I don't even know when he's sleeping,\" said Katie O'Mally, a medical student at Drexell University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell Group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his task, this is a possibility that they would never have had at home.
“We have been given the opportunity to accommodate operations where we have helped remove blood stains or to hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O'Malley said.
As a secondary student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
volunteer students usually pay themselves for their ride to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid to Bwella.
\"He's a hero, no doubt,\" O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroon's people is endless.
For Bwelle, almost constant work congestion is not a difficult test.
Helping others live a happy life by fulfilling their father’s promise is a source of great joy to him.
\"I'm so happy when I do this job,\" said Bwelle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snouden agreed to testify about Merkel's audition
Hans Christian Strebele, MP, met Moscow with Edward Snouden.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG Attorney General's Office in the case of a possible wiretap of the Chancellor's telephone by U.S. Specialists.
Snouden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans Christian Strebel, \"that he knows so much.
Despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snouden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to respond to the scandal surrounding US spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday that imposed additional restrictions on the activities of the American Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackay, stated this at a press conference with Foreign Minister Achmet Davutoglu of Turkey, reports to BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, and we have agreed that the two countries ' public administrations will provide universal support and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves, noted Vladimir Mackay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions for that purpose and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission had been held in Ankara, which had resulted in the signing of the protocol.
The Parties have produced a road map of the Belarusian-Turkish interface, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the areas of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as the search for new forms and areas of interaction.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey treat each other as reliable partners” he said.
Foreign Minister Achmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the Minister, Belarus and Turkey need to increase and bring it to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed because there is no potential available in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well as all the necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and of Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey, Achmet Davutoglu will be established.
Obama declines to say health care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama, yesterday, went to the crucifixion of his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people being notified of their services being cut off from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday Obama made a few corrections to his original public promise.
“The majority of people with health insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement to Boston.
With regard to what he called “news revitalization” regarding the termination of service delivery, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price, or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the people who purchase insurance on their own could be forced to change their plans because coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Accessive Medical Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans right now: you deserve better,” said Sibelius in an address to the Energy Committee and the House of Representatives Trade in Washington.
Sibelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the law on accessible health care, said that the launch of an Internet sale site was “satisfyingly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else, ” she said.
- I really want to regain your trust.”
The angry Sibelius refuted this phrase, which was captured by an on-line microphone sitting behind her at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the Billy Long House of Representatives, a Republican from the State of Missouri, as to whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long urged Sibelius to tell him again why the “architect” of the law on affordable medical care had voluntarily refused government sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through Healthcare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Agency-Rosbolt - denied media status for uncensorship.
On 31 October, Mosgorsoud decided that the registration licence of the agency - Rosbalt - - written - Lenta - was invalid.
Roskomnadzor, a systematic and gross violation of the media law, insisted on depriving the media agency.
In the course of the proceedings, an unpleasant precedent was set: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication of counter-arguments.
What's Rosbalt?
ZA - The Rossbalt Information Agency - was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies are also represented in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Since 2001, - Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been on the list of the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
However, Rosbalt has always occupied a fairly specific niche, with the core of the agency's exclusive publications being (and still constitute) notes referring to sources in law enforcement.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a broad base of sources in various departments, it was also said that Natalia Chappin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was the head of the project.
In this regard, the role of Chaplina in the \"Rosbolt\" leadership is not clear: it is most commonly referred to as \"the project manager\" -
The agency's Director-General is Larissa Afonin, Chief Editor, Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, \"Rosbolt\" did not appear in federal media ratings, either in quotes or in audiences.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the visit rating of Russian media sites on Live Internet.
According to the same Live Internet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
One of the most popular materials in the past five months is Kremlin's helplessness with Ukraine, the death of a group soloist - Korol, and the joke of thunders in the capital turquleve.
Conflict - Rosbalta - with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013 when amendments to the media law had come into force prohibiting non-censorship.
The company found banned vocabulary in two of the video agencies, Jagitt of Krasnodar, published on the website, and Pussy Riots desecrated the oil highs.
Further parties describe in different ways.
On the basis of the discovered video, Rosbullt accused the public of gross and systematic violation of the media law and asked the court to withdraw a licence from the agency.
B - Rosbalte stated that the department ' s claims were not valid: first, the rollers were not edited, secondly, the mother words were disguised, and thirdly, immediately after warning the rollers were removed from the site.
The agency appealed the Roskomnadzor claim to the world court, and when Mosgorsoud sued Roskomnadzor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, the number of justices in the world has already been reduced to the decision not to favour - Rosbalt, chief editor Nikolai Ulianov, found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles - 10,000 for each roller.
Obviously, this predates the outcome of the Moshorsoud hearing, if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been anticipated earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to nullify the registration certificate - Rosbalta - effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
It cannot be said that \"Rosbolt\" remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by the deputies of Gosdoum (a statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Javov on 10 October; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the PRRF).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was expressed by the head of the Union of Journalists, All-Wodom Bogdanov, the president of the Moscow Journalists Union, Paul Gussev, and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskomnadzor leadership even provided him with some assurance that it would not work before the withdrawal of the licence.
The Court over - Rosbalt has shown that under whose jurisdiction the media is safer in Russia today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capabilities, and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, was completed one day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy the production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combat toxic substances for use.
Destruction of the toxic stockpiles themselves or of their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the toxic substances are now located in sealed reservoirs.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time not to allow the Syrian authorities to carry out more chemo - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being disposed of.
Next milestone in mid-November: To date, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment?
All Syrian applications will be thoroughly verified by Western intelligence services.
They are willing to advise the inspectors of new facilities for verification if they are suspected that Damascus is not complete.
The United States believes that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case with the Syrian rebels.
The world community required Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached under Russian mediation, to destroy or bring to a non-workable state all the capacity to manufacture projectiles, poison gases and liquids and to fill the shells of these substances.
Now that this phase has been reached, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in place in the Syrian army.
This arsenal is expected to contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, each-break mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals, which are stored in several tens of different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities must agree on a schedule of action for two weeks.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors were personally monitoring the destruction of equipment —
“They can no longer continue to manufacture or mix chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement stated that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the shell and poison plants were either destroyed or mistreated.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, said in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the chemical infrastructure was — especially difficult — as it had to work during the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW had received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it was not yet time for inspectors to celebrate it, and they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that the U.S. spy has gone \"far off\"
John Kerry has shown that United States surveillance protection tactics have been mitigated, making it unprecedented to acknowledge that in some cases, US spying has gone “unbelievably far”.
The Secretary-General also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on the auto pilot” during Edward Snouden's loud cries about NSA spying.
These leaks of information have put the United States Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking by video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are taking place on autopilots, because this was already possible — and during the Second World War, and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, on 11 September”.
He then became the first senior U.S. government member to admit that the U.S. spyship had gone too far but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, \"Sometimes this has gone a long way.
The President is determined to shed light on the issue and to explain himself to the people, and now he is conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one is in a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of good motive and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is radical extremism in the world, a senseless and determined to kill people, bomb people and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented the crashing of aircraft, the explosion of buildings and the killing of people, because we have been able to learn of these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, American legislators would go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the President of the Senate on European Affairs said on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy said that he had interviewed members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment of the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who is the first-term president of the Senate's subcommittee of international relations, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures included documents released by Snouden showing that the NSA monitored the Chancellor of Germany’s mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said that it was a normal case on both sides.
Against that background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still in the drafting phase.
Although Merphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to help improve relations, he said that some degree of “best inducement” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had used for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to United States intelligence activities.
New members of the public observatories will have increased the influence of prison inmates
The Council of the Public Chamber (OP) is now able to approve new compositions of the Social Observatory Commissions (NCCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the browbysts of the Syllabists will increase their influence.
NCs are social structures that monitor conditions of detention in detention centres.
Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Exportagev's affairs, riots in the Copey colony - it is through the UNC that most of the resonance accidents behind the grid are announced.
HNC is being controlled by the fight between human rights defenders and militant lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the ONC, I suggested that the selection of experiences in human rights work be made a criterion.
- He wasn't accepted, and he'd set up lists without drawing up the criteria - he's told by Valery Borschov.
Borsov is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian body of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
To be a Member of the State of the State of the State of the Republic of Iraq, he has drawn up a law regulating the activities of the NNC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of ONC composition in 43 regions of the country.
1,800 vacant seats are claimed by fewer than a thousand candidates, while in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria, competitions were unable to be organized owing to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a dossier into vacant places.
The Moscow NNC is one of the few commissions with a contest, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead.
According to Borskhev, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 militants, while the option of voting in the OP, changes the ratio by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were seeking access to the capital commission.
But the new composition can be re-entered by a representative of the Godly Brotherhood, Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the NNC for three years but never visited prisoners.
In the view of the Forcers, having appointed their Chairman of the NNC, they would be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so that human rights defenders did not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the Forcers is coordinated by an NNC member, Anton Cvetkov, who is head of Russia, an organization that defends the interests of the force departments.
- I don't have babies on the track - - RBC daily Anton Flowers said.
He denied that he was lobbying to advance any lists and said that he did not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested oppositionrs.
According to Flowerwood, he didn't even care what list he was currently voting for.
He considers the disclosure of the Borg information to be a form of pressure.
The likely success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Chilean ONC.
Her former leaders will be cut off because of last year's copier riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
In the meantime, the Rostova-na-Don NNC can move from human rights defenders to militants.
One of the new lists is missing, but one of his opponents, a human rights defender-chaired local commission, even though he was expelled from the Federal Public House in May 2013 for unethical conduct.
Lists of Moscow and the Borszev Commission consider — the place for Kopisk —
The revelations of the Toloconnikova Hope did not affect Mordavia ' s UNC, which is considered to be “forced,” but only one human rights defender, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
The member of the OP Board, Nikolai Swanidze, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was outraged at the situation in Moscow and Rostow-na-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His associate of OP Paul Gussev says he voted in favour of the Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the compilation of the ONC lists by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC daily that he did not believe that it was appropriate to allocate candidates to human rights defenders and police officers and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of their members.
Grib shall not predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in a prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming to have been subjected to a taxi attack, appealed for a sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally found on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court guilty of filing a false lawsuit following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her back.
However, tape recordings later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after her relationship with her Australian boyfriend had broken down.
Phuket police questioned Bamford within two days before she confessed to fabricating this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the general prison centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who has sought the assistance of her daughter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tanks told Sydney daily Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of its daughter and was awaiting her return to Australia.
“It is obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that it will return home safely as soon as possible,” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 batts.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Kraby resort zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but cautioned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and instituting her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of an Australian tourist, Michel Smith, in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to recover its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senczyn is now in Paris to present his novel, Eltishev, translated into French.
Remember, it was this novel that became the finalist for the four prizes: the clear field, the Russian Book, the National bestseller, and the White Book.
Last year, the writer of the book was awarded cultural awards by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senczyn is an unquestionable leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old proselytes.
Almost every publication of its rigid, modern life - material stories and narratives is hotly controversial among critics in many ways.
It can be argued that the combined articles on prose and publicist Sencín, his book reviews and magazine publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
The debate on works — one of the most controversial of modern writers — according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, most of the discussion is that its participants understand under the word “literacy” as they see the present and future not only of our vocabulary but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
The analytical and review articles are generally given in sections “Abzacs ...” -
