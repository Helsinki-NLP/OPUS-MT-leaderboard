In my view, the literature program was formed by the Balsakawa age ladies on the basis of their interests.
From the 19th century Russian literature, we preferred the Danilewski and the Volkonian.
Of course, from the perspective of the same Balesak age ladies, they wrote whitetrics.
And the psychology and the torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroine for teenagers is not so interesting.
Young people are rarely interested in hero psychology at all.
Thank you very much, very much.

Matras Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model-Mypraket Prestige is a comfort and a natural composition.
The matras have different rigidities: the mid-rigid surface is formed by latexed coconut fibre and natural latex, and the moderately soft surface is formed by a plate of natural latex.
A spring block of 1,000 spring per square metre is rapidly adapted to the body of the sleeping body, warning the effect of the wave - or ham -
Breathing materials need to be identified among the merits of the model.
The latex, which is perforated for airtightness, is well ventilated in a natural way, like a coconut coyre.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of the bedroom remains.
The matras are also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The period of formal assurance from the manufacturer is 5 years, and in fact the life of the mattress is greater.
The dust and pollution protection is provided by a decommissioned chechole from the jaccardium supplied in the kit.
You can buy an orthopedic pillow in a pair, which is recommended to keep the spine optimal during sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the cocos parties as an anatomical support for the back, and the latex relaxes the muscles.

Then change the dishes, clean the house.
One week before the festival, you're taking food, two days to sleep, the day after.

They're good, and the cake's definitely with itself.
That's when I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I'm going to put the table on the floor.
And I cook tastes for them, and it's very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth vaccination from the Coronavirus is inevitable
Fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite the extensive lobbying campaign in Germany, two or three doses of measles vaccine may not be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the Association of Physicians of General Practice, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
That's what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert believes.
Weigeldt also hopes that the fourth vaccination from the Coronavirus will be possible - combined with influenza vaccination -
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of the Coronavirus-Omikron-
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection by Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is illustrated by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Therefore, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer are planning to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Coronavirus - Omikron -
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that the effectiveness of two doses of vaccines is significantly lower: - Neutralising capacity is reduced by more than 25 times -
- This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection - - stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts are insisting on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, Chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, was in favour of reducing the interval between second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta-virus and the omicron-variant coronavirus.
“ Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” emphasized the expert.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other things that were originally created with the use of an ice-fisher, not just for fishing.
These species have a larger weight than those of close counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of these interesting lures.
Another recognized feature is the upper fin of a strong and obsolescence plastic, which creates additional vibrations at both vertical and horizontal wires.
As the winter vibe, the Bet-A-Vib catcher shows a rather aggressive game.
Often, there is a simple monotonous animation, which is to say, of the up-and-down movement.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, broken down by underwater vegetation, crusts and other obstacles for which the trailer is capable.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant to the capture of a boat and a large window in winter, especially in the middle of winter, when the precise and aggressive baiting is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib rotates instantly and returns to the reference vertical.
At least successfully Bet-A-Vib applies also to winter fishers of the pond trout.
To please her caprises, you can choose from two modifications: a noise capsule (NS-NanoSound) or without (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that a bet-A-Vib is capable of annoying the passive cheek, which does not even react to the stomach.
The Bet-A-Vib shack shows range and accuracy.
It is understood and is not caprisen, and it combines well with the blades and pliable cords of even large diameters.
For fishing, the cat's ashtray, the boat, the ersh, or the perch, except for the equivalency, and the step, sometimes the brisket, is on the bottom.
If you catch in closed places, you can change the front triple into a double, which will reduce the likelihood of the chains.
Among the baits of his class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most sustainable in the workplace and, consequently, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, both relatively small and relatively deep areas can be used.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries
Libya has more than 7,000 mercenaries from a private military company (FAC) - Wagner -
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of State of the Republic of Khaled Al-Mishri.
- There are currently over 7,000 PWC-Wagner mercenaries in Libya
They also have aircraft.
They also breed trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets on the Gardabi aircraft bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) - it quotes him as an Anadolu agency.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries were trying to seize the central part of Libya extending from Chad to the Mediterranean after they had brought their man to power in the Central African Republic.
Synchronising folder
According to the interviewer, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and — based in Libya —
- Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as aircraft base in Jufrey, an agency publication.
The Russian authorities formally deny that the CWC-Wagner has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else the Mercenaries Can Be
According to the agency, “Wagner” is alleged to operate in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner's subsidiary enterprises - are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to these countries - are referred to in the article.
According to the media, the Wagners allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not included in the force departments or in the register of the yurits, and its fighters are not available in the uniformed lists of personnel.
The company is under United States sanctions.
Recall that the former post 27 EU countries approved the regressions against - Wagner -
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Higher Council of State de facto is the second House of Parliament, with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, written by TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the relocation of a single day of balloting on the election of Parliamentary and Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
- There's less than two weeks before the elections, and the chances of them going on in time are rapidly declining - it's noted in the material.
Against this background, Libya ' s Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of a final list of candidates, and is transmitting Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Politics by the Eyes of the Russians
38 per cent of Russians see foreign policy as more successful than failure, 29 per cent believe that failures prevail.

The main failures - the conflict with Ukraine - - confrontation with Western countries - isolation from the world - - are described in a study of the Fund - Public Opinion -
The Government of Dubai has completely renounced paper office, and all public servants have also become digital
The Government of Dubai reported on the total rejection of paper production and digital conversion.
All public services will also be provided only electronically.
This is reported by the Emirate News Agency WAM.
“This day marked the beginning of a new stage of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government -” stated on Saturday the late Prince of Emirates, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Mactoum.
The internal and external documentation in all Dubai State will now be digitized only through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, JKX, police, municipal authorities, courts and so on, many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to an e-Government and digitization of documentation has begun in Dubai since 2018.
Since then, the authorities have estimated that 336 million paper sheets have been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million of monetary equivalents.
Previously, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobianin stated that e-services would save 2 days a year to citizens.

Turkey ' s car production and exports fell below 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish vehicles declined sharply in November against the backdrop of lira depreciation.
As a result, 11 months of industry performance was worse last year, reported Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey, a 20 per cent decrease from one year earlier.
Some 75,000 vehicles were sent to export, with over 25 per cent taking the last year's figure.
If, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish road sector has shown positive momentum by last year, the car output has been 0.3 per cent worse than last year ' s 11 months of 2021.
The cause of this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which went 29 per cent as far as the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IMS entities have received loan deferrals in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smail reported on the granting of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, handed over to MIA-Kazinform correspondent
According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to an order issued by the Head of State on 1 April 2021 by the Chairman of the Agency of 9 April 2021 No. 127 concerning approval of the order to grant deferral of payments on small- and medium-sized business loans, Alihan Smaylov wrote in his response to the request for deputies.
He recalled that the arrangement for deferral of loan payments provided for the deferral of loan payments by banks and microfinance organizations prior to 1 April 2021 to IAS entities, including IPRs, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral was between 30 and 90 days by choice of IAS entity.
The borrower ' s application could indicate a different time period for deferral of payments.
During the deferral period, the claimant had been suspended, notified of the need to settle the outstanding debt, and charged commissions and other payments by the creditor,” noted the freezer.
In 2021 the second level of banks applied for deferred loan payments of 603 IUU borrowers, of which 553 IUUF entities with a delay of 9.7 billion tenge were granted.
IFI has applied for a deferral of 131 IUU entities, of which 95 entities with a value of 105.8 million tenge have been granted deferrals, and A. Smail.
Pulmonologist Puresev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry a strain called ocmirone
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry him lighter than those with a strong protective response to the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puresev explained why the strain of the coronavirus ocmirone might be dangerous.
The cause should be found when the virus is born.
Scientists believe that “ocmyron” has been born into a body infected with HIV or to suffer from immunodeficiency.
I mean, at the mutation, he didn't face any resistance from immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no reply from immunity, it became very fast.
He seems to have these stick whites there, spikes, maybe more than what he's laid, their antibodies didn't cut during mutations, and he's commenting on the pulmonologist Sergei Puresev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry ocmirone more easily than those with a strong protective response to the body.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections when 30-year-olds die and 60-year-olds carry that.
The young man's immune response is completely inadequate: where you could just threaten your toe, he's beating like a gun on a shoe, and he's got Sergei Puresev.
The doctor also recalled that the Coronavirus had dangerous side events and that the most unpleasant of them was pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often only buy symptoms -- the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of body intoxication - temperature, weakness, weakness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, first in the throat, cough.
The pain on the right or on the left may also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, the growing generation of 12 - to 18 - year - olds in Russia may start vaccination before the end of the year.
The virologist, the head of the MFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory, Paul Volchkov, noted that this category is very active with the cod.
The number of contacts among adolescents attending school is as high.
This is the most socially active layer, like kindergarten educators,” said Moscow 24 - Paul Wolckov, a virologist, head of the MTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory.
The author's greatest thanks for this article.

Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity are victims of cod
The authors studied fat from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fat tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists have also examined the fat tissue of patients who have died from the cod and have discovered particles of coronavirus in the body surrounding the various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in fat as a reservoir in attempts to avoid immune system responses.
This is probably what SARS-CoV-2 is capable of.
Biologist Explained the Causes of Dementia
Simeon Gološekin, a biological science candidate, described the causes of the dementation and the methods of its prevention in Sputnik radio interviews.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is shown to be a gradual loss of cognitive function - in time, it is difficult for a person to direct himself in a familiar environment.
Gološekin noted that dementia is most commonly caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, the role of such factors as social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity was possible, he said.
Dementation is also affected by harmful habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances, and poor lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
The discussion was that hearing loss could be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for it - added a biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of disease, WHO recommends that the necessary levels of fidgeting, cognitive skills and memory and logic be maintained.
Previously, the professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics, FGAOU, WO NIMU.
N.I. Pyrogova, head of the cognitive disorder division of the Federal Centre for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepov, described the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artefacts taken from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has succeeded in bringing back some 30,000 artefacts that have been illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, 29,300 artifacts have been recovered from the Egyptian State.
It was not until this year that 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C., that he said.
Abdel Gauad explained that all smuggled artifacts were registered in the archives.
The Department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals are monitoring auctions around the world and online sales through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return, cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that an ancient skeleton of a person, now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, had been discovered in Belgium.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutanhamon’s auction site in London.
Christie's auction house on 4 July was tendered for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles) over 3,000 years of age.
This led to Egyptian discontent.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art item was illegally removed from the Carnack Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhamon, represented in the image of the sun god Amon, had been kept in private collection and had not been displayed in the marketplace since 1985.
How the relic came into Europe is not known.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported ancient monuments in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggling antiquity is the result of archaeological research - black diggers -
The Crimean Tatars - and that's right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) - are an autonomous people (near to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people -- so many Tatars (Cazanian) live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only a Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile staff devices
Credit Suisse requires her staff to grant the bank access to their personal mobile devices, says Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount to purchase a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under existing regulations, a bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to test mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member has used it to meet a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote operation, the bank wants to extend the rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with the working issues.
According to the paper, the bank management has set an deadline for staff members to consult the new rule.
The new requirement is not officially commented on in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but he was the hardest poet and his ego.
He's out of any literary association, he's infatuated, he's on his own, but he's famous, wanted, and at times he's strongly angry, even vicious, but the audience who's reading is willing to wear him.
Over 60 poems were written in a year, many of them -- real masterpieces, the cycle -- the Persian motive -- the poem \"Anna Snow\" -- published eight books, the compilation \"The Rose of Soviets\" --
And the main success was at the end of June 25th, that Gossedat made a treaty with Esenin to produce his works in 3rd volumes.
None of the modern-day Sergei Alexandrovich poets have ever heard of this honor, he's the first one!
In addition, it was a very good amount of money, with a fee of 1,000 roubles a month for 20 months (the director of the factory, for example, received 300 roubles per month, engineer 200).
That year's funds were needed more than ever.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, had to develop a family life, hold the sisters Katya and Sasha, and her mother.
It's like there's a way of life to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark tones, as if a nightmare was materialized from the poem \"The Red Man\" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Jessen):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
And above the empty field and the desolate field,
It's like fat in September,
He's got alcohol in his brain.
Many acquaintances have pointed out that Esenine has given up, does not look well, is clearly sick.
There's a lot of replay, a lot of nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably more than just alcoholism...
And yet, if the diagnosis of alcoholism -- Sergei Alexandravica -- is something that's been treated, there's no reliable documentation left.
Say, as of May 1923, when Esenin was fourth wife, Aysedora Duncan, the American woman, had improved her health at a clinic under Paris to Professor Peter Hannuskin, two years later, in Moscow.
And the evidence of the poet's spells, of the scandals on the ground, of the police's reports, is that dozens of memoirs have been sprinkled.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet and the green snake have developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly settled with a friend, Imguinist Ivan Starkz.
Amazingly, Esenine never had his own home in Moscow or in Peter, but he found himself in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The ancients remember:
“ It was only nighttime, and most of the time in an uninhabitable, intoxicated state.
On one occasion, when Esenin returned at four o'clock in the morning, he fell on the stairs...
Falling, scratching his face and scrambling.
When he got a little bit into himself, he sipped his cough, scribbled all the blood of the sheets...
Yes, Esenin himself, after a European and U.S. war (the U.S. law was then dry, but Duncan took with it a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
- I haven't seen anything in there except the cabs and the streets...
I'm at the end and people don't remember...
Well, the dust, of course...
And I'm drinking because it's too thick.

Matras Promtex-Oriente Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promethex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is the modern implementation of the budget model in the Award Class line.
The base of the matras is a block of independent double-stranded Duet spring.
A softer small spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows the load on the mattress to be evenly distributed.
On two sides, the matras is supplemented by an artificial latex.
It's the same as a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibleness and ebbiness of this material increases the comfort of the matras.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
A pair with a large difference in weight (about 30 kilos) will be excellent.
At smart, the spring doesn't have a wave effect here when the light partner jumps towards the heavy side.
A nice, soft-to-feel chamomile from Sense's practical jaccardium is stitched with a layer of synthepone.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this matras model in a compressed version (vacuum roll packaging).

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as weapons against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as weapons -
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Jablonsky, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenco, had used refugees as weapons against the European Union and intended to return to such an operation next year -
A statement was made by the MlD Zambrant in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonski, the sanctions against Belarus were suspended - stopped by Lukashenco - but he is actively seeking new ways -
Also, Polish officials are confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons -- in many parts of the world --
As kp.ru had written, the European Union had previously launched the fifth sanctions package against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there has been a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic if the situation in the country does not improve -
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Back in September, at the premier film - It's not the time to die - it's in a barricade raspberry jacket and a traditional Bondov box.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first attended the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, an inappropriate royal dresco-code, green barhat jacket, and then chose a more classical version for the Royal Variety charity event.
A couple of weeks ago, there was Lionel Messiah on himself.
The football player came to pick up the seventh - Golden Ball - in the Dolce & Gabbana warp jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barhat men's jackets in Russia.
According to the surveyors, the services at Gazette Ru began purchasing 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular warm, dark blue jackets, the most common are those of dark refugees, bord, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is £3 to £6,000, and men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of barhat suits are less likely to be chosen.
You can buy them not only from the Ritellers online.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In this season, almost all brands, both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent, are represented in the sleek section of the barhat jacket.
The Gucci model is the most desirable one, with its release to one of the premier films, Home Gucci, the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto.
When you choose the jackets of expensive stamps, you can be sure that the barhat is made of silk.
Special interlacing techniques produce dense tissue with a furry outer texture and a smooth inner side.
The more budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also serve less accordingly.
The mode expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoskin warns that, in the case of a barhot jacket, the main thing is not his model or his fasone, but the appropriateness.
- Barhat needs evening light, so it's perfect if you're going to have a party or a celebration, he's going to be right for you if the invitation says \"Black Tie\" or \"Creative Black Tie\"
Another important criterion that allows choice in favour of a berry to be met is the buyer ' s status.
- A man in a barhat jacket, first of all, has to make up for the right kind of advanced stuff, - the authors of the Telegram Channel on men's fashion - Brammel - The owners of barhot jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to take part in the day-to-day light events, which always indicate a dresset code.
Ilya Vachoshkin suggests combining a jacket of barhats with the same kind of fine stuff: classic pants with arrows, single - ton shirts, silk ties, bonecrackers, cuffs.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The modern experts from Krasavika Brammel are confident: it will also be inappropriate to appear in the barchat jacket of an official on the corporation, and that is, if it is the leader of the company, that is, to him, that is the thing in the subject.
If the rank is down and the aim is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out the financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a barhat jacket.
It's definitely going to appreciate that in the phrase, not in the Senka hat, the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings of vote.
It's an unnatural timbre, so exhausted.
And it's completely out of association with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the heart I desire good luck in life.
It's all about money. Alternative energy is good for you, that's what you're paying for.
Billion investments.
Do they grieve?
No, the electricity price has grown.
Traditional energy was also not in overhead, both gas and oil, and coal was bought cheaper than they were currently selling.
There's wild demand for fuel.
I've got a little drop.
Then who's on the flight?
As usual, it's a private buyer.
Do Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who are asking for an energy crisis.
They did their job.
It's a good moustache.
I didn't see any beautiful people on the photos in the story.
It's just the middle passenger mediation.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they're probably not going to fit in.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such beautiful people -- but it's not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, a slave conscious of and fighting his slave position, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and who is in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is just a slave.
A slave whose sluts flow when he complacently describes the beauty of a slave's life and admires a good and good houseman, is a dove, a ham.
Immunologist said that revaccination would help protect you from the strain of the coronary micron in 4 to 5 months -
Revocation in four or five months can protect against the new strain of the coronary infection, micron.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, a very large period of time -
“ With the last strains, this was normal, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and the people with chronic diseases in four, ” said the expert, calling in parallel with the training campaign, to perform the revocation.
Kreechkov also noted that early revocation provided a good titration of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a butcher, or if he was sick and vaccinated, or if he was vaccinated and ill, he obtained “hybrid immunity — that is, the antibody is numerous and neutralizing enough” the expert explained.
- The larger seven - warned Russia of `scale effects' - in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G-7 countries (United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the United States) issued a statement following a meeting of MID heads in Liverpool.
It stresses that the “war aggression - Russia against Ukraine - will have tremendous consequences and will cost dearly - Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the build-up of the military might of Russia and of aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine.”
The Ministers further call on Russia to ease the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities - as President Baiden of the United States spoke during a video call to President Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Nordic format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.”
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response - they caution.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the restraint in Ukraine's position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive answer - also stated in the statement.
Earlier in the day, Elizabeth Trass, head of British diplomacy, stated that Russia would be seriously affected in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed a voice - the single voice of the G-7 countries - which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia -
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than omicron strain
The vaccine performance of Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of the Coronavirus is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have concluded this conclusion by conveying South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccination was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but that ability was significantly reduced against omicron diversity,” Professor Malik Peiris told.
Scientists have also stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe flow of the disease when infected with the Coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the Coronavirus pandemic in the light of its effects on omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron strains could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the FWG of blocking NATO arms transfers to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, Alexey Reznikov, accused the Government of former Chancellor FWG Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had vetoed Ukraine's anti-Sniper systems and drone rifles.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government, under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine in Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholtz.
He said that the previous leadership of the FWG had explained its refusal to provide arms with a risk of developing military escalation of conflict in Donbas, despite the occupation of Russia, part of Ukrainian territory.
The same — illogical — position, certain diplomat, Germany will remain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin to equip the fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to be Ukraine ' s technical partner - added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habeck, co-chair of the Green Party, visited a republic that had advocated the sale of Kiev's defence weapons.

G7 warned Russia of liability for invasion of Ukraine
Foreign Ministers of G7 countries warned of - serious consequences - for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the outcome statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces within the borders of the country.
“The Russian Federation must have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The Ministers of G7 and Supreme Representative of the EU noted that they had been united in condemning the Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine -
The head of the British MID, Elizabeth Trass, at a Liverpool press conference, warned of “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wanted Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine, she said (quoted by TASS).
Previously, Foreign Ministers G7 had agreed at the Liverpool summit that, in order to resolve the crisis, Russian troops on the border with Ukraine needed to return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in the Norman format . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Discovered methods of returning stolen money via online games
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online gambling and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were opened by information security experts in conversation with RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses in banking card data, it is recommended that key funds be stored on a map or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
A portion of the savings can be deferred to the savings account and deducted as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate online purchase card.
If money was stolen from shops that do not use the 3D Safe technology, the recovery procedure can be initiated.
Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Safe, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service in question.
The expert from the Ecompay international payment provider, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer was entitled to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction not later than 120 days after purchase.
Furthermore, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require a two-factor authorisation, the transaction could be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases the Internet motorists are returning funds to the client themselves if the order has not yet been shipped.
On 19 November, a member of the Public House, Director of the Safe Internet League, Yekaterin Mizuline, reported that in 2021 only 11,000 fraud cases had been received, ranging from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that the creation of a single window for complaints about online frauds could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz came to Poland to discuss the “Northern Flow 2” and EU legislation
The newly elected chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline - North Stream-2 -
Although Scholtz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations from each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moroviecki, said that he would call upon Scholz to speak against the “Northern Stream 2” on which Russian gas was expected to be brought to Germany to the vicinity of Ukraine.
According to Morsowek, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms by the right party - Law and justice - violated EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court held that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
The new German Government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take on public commitments to stop the work of the “Northern Stream 2” in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had come to an understanding with Germany that the pipeline would stop if Russia invaded Ukraine on Tuesday, a senior U.S. Congress official.
German officials failed to confirm these communications, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine ' s border, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the “More Seven” on Sunday -

You'll pay 20,000 dollars to the church wall to pay the money you found in the church wall.
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay a prize.
This is reported in a press release of Crime Stoppers of Houston, a non-profit organization.
The incident took place in Lakewood, a large evangelical church preaching to pastor Joel Austin, promising that godly Christians would be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Justin Caughley repaired a church toilet and found thousands of bags of money and cheques in thermal insulation.
He handed over the church’s discovery, saying that he had not even received Austin’s thanks.
I wanted to hear him say, \"You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could have done - - - quotes it KPRC-TV.
The find appears to be linked to the theft that took place in Lakewood seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques were lost in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no loss.
Nevertheless, information about the perpetrators was announced with a $25,000 reward.
Justin Caughley could not claim this amount because the award had expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, in due course awarding $5,000 and later receiving another $20,000 in gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Previously, the police had questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood wall.
Tanya, her words, her actions are her characteristics, how real is a person?

In Brazil, citizens were required to deliver vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Robert Barroso, was required to apply for a permit to enter the territory of the States.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have evidence against vaccination have been released from the vaccination certificate.
The list of exceptions also includes those who have come from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for the New Year’s, Pre-Corval, Carnival, and other events, which implies an increase in the turbo stream,” said Barroso.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities had obliged those who were not immune from the Coronavirus infection to comply with the five-day quarantine.

A virologist, a doctor of medical science, earned by Russian scientist Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of total protection against the coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved through the introduction of an injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
Internasal use is produced in large quantities of immunoglobulin A. There is no injection into the vaccine.
The immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antitels).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there's no decision on double vaccination, and he told me.
Chief prophylaxis UrFO, doctor of medical science Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in such a case, the body ' s protection was expected to be maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Lower City David Melik Gussenov region stated that the new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic would result in the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that this was the case in other countries where a further pandemic wave had occurred earlier.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to a cobel for a long time -- if you're ready to change the warm house, the brownie, the favor, the love and the play to the warm bitch, then to the front.
But the pesel was trained and smart at all.
I chose my society and went home.
The video is a way that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they owed it to him, 200,000 to flee (pam), to take over his hand directly and to the other side.
In the end, 200,000 chose the host, not the dog that ran around there.
Mass protests of vaccinators in Europe continue unabated
More than forty thousand demonstrators went out to the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They complained about the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the vaccination compulsory.
Since February next year, uninvited people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, made a peace march in Madrid.
Some have held signs in their hands with the inscription “It’s a false pandemic. ” “ I won’t vaccinated ”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night-time entertainment facilities.
The imposition of sanitary passports by authorities in several regions of the country has been against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of contamination by the Coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, over a thousand manifests protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully but then grew into a clash with the guards.
The group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied water-meat.

WHO has discovered the Omicron, already in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that a new strain of coronavirus-micron has been discovered in 63 countries.
Several experts have already said that spreading a new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The spread rate of the strain was described in a WHO report.
As of 9 December, the organization has identified strains in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This, with its active distribution only since late November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of proliferation of the new coronavirus version.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on preliminary data may be bypassed by the extent of the spread of the delta strains, as well as by the Indian version of the Coronavirus, which is now being managed in all absolute countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Andreas Adhan Hebreyesus, said that omicron strains could have a significant impact on the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have also been reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the Micron will expel - delta - in the coming months
And the number of patients in Britain alone is going to be about 1 million, with the official micronome - currently a few hundred people getting sick in the Kingdom and an estimated 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain - and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals on a peak daily basis.
What the British health system will fail to do.
The situation is compounded by the fact that according to recent studies, the vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech versus the micron strain is 32 times lower than that of the rest of the disease.
How the Russian-Sputnik V reacts in the next few weeks.
The Hamalaya Center has just begun a Russian vaccine test on the micron strain.

The Russians warned of a new scheme of frauds
Thieves have begun to look for new maneuvers for video fraud.
It's written by News with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, dipféics are the main risks associated with the distribution of video communications.
In this case, feicing videos are created on the basis of actual records with the participation of the victim.
As a result, the neuroscientists are able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person’s behavior.
The Abutalims added that using a dipfijk, the attackers could call the familiar victims by video link or create a video-mailing video.
“ Such falsifications can easily provoke bulling, since a fallen man may place people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-distributions,” said the expert.
The leading systems engineer, Varonis Alexander Wetcol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technology.

Five actions are listed to help avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to it, and they do.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications, even death, over time.
Preventive interventions play a key role in preventing disease formation.
Doctors recommend, for example, that the drinking regime be changed - the reduction of a variety of drinks and the transition to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase sugar levels in blood to a dangerous indicator when used in excess.
So the first step on the road to healthy lifestyles is to stop buying and storing sweets at home.
In addition to eating bad habits, the disease is affected.
In order to reduce the risks of diabetes, a lot of movement is needed.
Experts recommend low-carbon diet.
Not only would such a diet reduce weight but it would also protect the sugar level from extreme fluctuations.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of satiety, the release of digestive juices, and an increase in food intake.

Dr. Pavlov told about “the migraines of the weekend ” of the labour force
Several factors may lead to a deterioration in the feeling of weekends
The reason for the deterioration of self-perception after working days is often, migraine of the weekend, told a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, candidate for medical science, Senior Fellow at Basic Medicine of the ISU, Head of System Medicine Clinic, Zuhr Pavlov, in her telegram channel.
She said that this is especially true of workaholics, who have headaches, divisions, and weaknesses on weekends.
Dr. Pavlov noted that, in addition to the one-week fatigue, there are quite a number of objective reasons why the body reacts negatively to changing conditions.
During the weekend, our lives have changed radically.
- For a long time, the whole day lies on the couch, most likely to eat more, and less to drink, the doctor argued.
Reeating and water shortages - gravity and fragmentation -
Late recovery plays an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later, you get a reaction called a jatlag.
It comes from travellers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors that play a decisive role in the deterioration of self - feelings, Paul recommended that Paul’s reaction be made that the greatest change in weekends.

UAR scientists stated that the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron was not effective -
In South Africa, the Pfizer v. omicron vaccine has been reported to be under-performing.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported that the Pfizer vaccine was low against the omicron strain of the Coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the neutralization level of the micron corresponds to a (level) effectiveness of the 22.5% vaccine against symptom infection, which makes it... doubtful the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, as stated in a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
Experts have also specified that the drug can save the sickness from a severe flow of disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron strain of the Coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in your regular products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
His excess diet can lead to type 2 diabetes and also lead to cardiovascular and cancers.
Consumers should bear in mind that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to that of calories, composition and glycemic index may be included in the product under an unknown word.
A number of dozens of names, in fact, representing sugar, can be presented on the label.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other striations, such as dextroza (a corn sugar), levolose (a fructo sugar), melasa (a black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that refer to mono and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in candy but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
According to Russia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to draw attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product, such as syrup or nectar, is processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only is it necessary to take into account the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
The total amount of sugar may therefore be much higher than the label.
German chancellor Scholtz: gas will lose importance to the FWG 25 years later
The new chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
He said that by 2045, Germany planned to completely renounce gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
- That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transport to the FRG and Europe will play a different role,” said the chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the transport of Russian natural gas in Ukraine and in the future, as this resource is important to the energy transition at this time.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that recorded the support of Berlin for Ukraine ' s energy transformation.
Previously, Head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbok, stated that the gas pipeline certification process - North Stream - 2 - was continuing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was not in compliance with the requirements of the European Union.

Hackers hacked the Twitter Prime Minister of India
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The attackers were able to publish a fairy message.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in the third ballot was much lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of France voted in favour of the independence of New Caledonia, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted in opposition to —
Jacque was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
As the French-Presse Agency comments on these intermediate outcomes, the outcome of the elections did not leave room for doubt - as independence advocates called on voters not to vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed the holding of the referendum on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 in the archipelago prevented a full and fair electoral campaign from taking place.
Thus, this lack of participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence in 2018 and 53.3 per cent in 2020.
As the separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As was reported on Sunday, 12 December, in the palace of Elisha, French President Emmanuel Makron is expected to follow the referendum.
The subject of independence of New Caledonia has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates preferred that the Territory remain in France because it was the last European Union presence in the Pacific -
“New Caledonia must remain French,” repeated Eric Zemmoor on several occasions.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pekrez, who published a column in Le Figaro late in October urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position - because it was not his responsibility -
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”
Prime Minister Jean Casteks, for his part, expressed “the strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France”

An earthquake of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of 5.2 occurred near the chicken island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicentre was 231.8 kilometres north-east of North-Curilsk.
Ochag covered a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists had recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, affecting 10 people.

Ukraine will start producing new generation ' s jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to develop ANKA-like jet drones.
On 11 December, a visiting adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovic reported the matter.
That is, they are capable of acting against aircraft, against other drones.
Even against aircraft piloted.
The Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft, including the Corps and the like, will be on them, citing his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA's machinery, Arestovich explained that it was about reactive rather than porous BPLAs.
He said it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it by all characteristics.
The BPLA ' s first batch was to be produced by the plant at the end of the following year, and Arestovic was concluded.
An ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of drones has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the previous day, the Ukrainian General Headquarters had secreted data on the use of the Bayraktar drones and the Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbas.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the construction of a modern military drone plant had begun.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian Minorana concluded an agreement on the construction of a centre in Kiev to train and test and service the Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum a big real step forward -
Two lions fled the airport from the container
At Changhi Singapore, lions fled.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that they remain unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and to where they went.
One of the runaway lions has moved on the roof of the container.
The beasts were unable to get away from him because of the safety net next to him.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is responsible for all Singapore zoos.
They derailed lions by means of tranquilizer wires and planned to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Previously, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, the lion had fled from his host and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not hurt.
Experts warned about the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research indicates that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less likely to have some cancers, particularly colorectal cancers.
However, the excess of the right dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor Beth Kitchin of the University of Alabama, Birmingham, recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimum dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if the figure is significantly further away from the larger or smaller side.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 not be taken in pills without the advice of a doctor, that it be necessary to monitor the dosage and avoid cotton with milk and other foods containing folic acid.
Previously, Rachel Fine, a nutrition consultant, called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Feyn recommended that men eat the fruit more often after 50 years.
In Britain, about 75,000 people may die from omicron strains by April.
British scientists predict that the omicron strain may cause up to 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened by winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which reports to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the British Cabinet Emergency Advisory Group, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths are recorded in the country due to the omicron strain, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, more than 2,000 infected persons will be admitted to hospitals at the peak of disease.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the omicron strains are more contagious than the delta option and current vaccines cannot eliminate contamination” said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The United Kingdom Health Safety Agency had previously informed us that if the rate of omicron strain spread continued at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection would be detected at the end of the year.
By mid-December, omicron strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicron strain coronavirus were found in Britain, of which 633 were reported in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, however, the head of the British Ministry of State, Sadjid Javid, indicated that in reality the figure could reach 10,000.

The demand for super-yachts has grown by one quarter in the world.
This year ' s superstructure and the next year ' s orders strike the world with all the record, despite calls to reduce hydrocarbon footprints and combat climate change.
In the world ship registry, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money to float for $50 million and above will not decrease, writes - Guardian -
But they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25 per cent more courts were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it wasn't 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear land-based contamination and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the Coronavirus.
If these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working away and the negotiations are on a zoo.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the shipyards were taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
“People just yearned for freedom, and super-gods could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize the rich and call them decadent.
Rich, sociologists say, they don't want to realize that in times when there's no space travel, life on yachts, or flying on their own planes, they're angry in society because elites don't want to share the responsibility for climate change with all the rest of humanity.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for super-gods, although they realize that such money mobility will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have food lengths above 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Recke is building a REV Ocean yacht 183 feet long.
It's gonna be the largest yacht in the world after going to water.
The yacht includes a moon basin, as well as a submarine designed to study the sea depths.
Helicopter sites are common in existing super-yachts, open-air cinemas, and in some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, a platform for competition. American University of Indiana's Professor of Economic Anthropology Richard Wilk says that the total sample amount of greenhouse gases produced by super-bolognaths is small compared with the total number of greenhouse gas samples.
But it's symbolic, given that the world's multi-billionaires are just over 2,000.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billions of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average statistical resident of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the planet's largest pollutant, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that hit the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trace was hidden on his Eclipse yacht, which was 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and command the boat, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The super-yacht owners do not sympathize others when they, as Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns the mines on the continent, complain through Yutub, that there is no room for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand its call to make marinas for vessels that wash 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly alcohol dose leading to development of bowel cancer is determined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is what the Daily Express says.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week was associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of colon cancer than women do.
The exact cause of this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors have led to a process harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, more precisely, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are intelligent.
Even so, they do not know how advanced four drinkers are.
Over the years, biologists have experimented with various experiments to be sure to learn how intelligent animals have developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
Scholars were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or create poems, make no sense in politics, economics, and art, but they often succeed in fooling their masters.
The representatives of some breeds consider experts to be the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but the statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Some breeds, for example, are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as labradoras.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are logical and that learning ability is not inferior to a two - year - old child.

U.S. and Russian traders in Ukraine
The United States and Russia - to trade - with regard to Ukraine’s entry into NATO, stated to analyst Alexander Cochekov in their article for the publication of “Glavord -
In his view, Washington and Moscow are soon planning to continue negotiations on United States assurances that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden about the right of countries to enter anywhere —
If you're offered something that's notoriously unacceptable, for example, selling a close relative to sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, but you're just sending the offerer.
In the case of Ukraine, the trade is about to take place - an analyst wrote.
Kocketskov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation shall be held in secret, quickly and immediately to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to find and deploy a force of opposition” he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway sector
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway and Equipment Exhibition, 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province / Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enabled trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted the representative of Howe Zhaoven.
High-speed trains on China-Laos railway line, which was operational at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with technology, which will increase the reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months China has significantly increased the exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed the China speed -
In May this year, the first two-storey electric power trains developed in China for export to Europe came from the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
A pilot subway train developed by the company for Turkey began operation in November.
The train will travel through the metropolitan area connecting the Istanbul centre to the city airport.
The subway line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
The China Railway Equipment Industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-class equipment in the world market” said Fen Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a number of independent studies and development, China has established a advanced system for the production of railway equipment, a complete set of support tools and large-scale manufacturing activities.
According to Fen Yaoxiang, the country is ranked first on the electrification level of railways and on the operating run of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early indications of dementation
Science candidate Simeon Gološekin listed early signs of dementation in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
He said that the signs of future dementing could be oblivion, as well as a series of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce the level of abstract thinking.
The discussion was currently under way that hearing loss could be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, a specialist said.
Gološekin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurogenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and the lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels were the most frequent causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, medical professionals do not know how to treat dementation effectively.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin to prevent it in time.
He said that foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of dementing.
WHO also recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic
There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still debated in the scientific community,” said Gološekin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical exertion, regular training in cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic” said Gološekin.
Previously, the Dementation Research charity in Britain had stated that the disease was affecting people under 40 years of age.
The medical profession called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign is vision problems, which make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was an aphasia, a state in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he or she wants to say.
Neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad
The former President of Georgia, Michael Saakashvili, needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalist Otar Toidze, who is part of a council of doctors established under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The issues involved in the movement, coordination, variability of character - a specialist said that they did not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-President should now be sent to special rehabilitation.
“It is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nerbial rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia,” noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashviví be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotage of receiving medical care after the prison staff had punished him with a disciplinary sentence.
Georgian policy was quick to abolish punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

In Spain, protests were held against COVID Passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia protested against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID Passports became compulsory for bar, restaurant, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifestans have come to stock without masks.
At their placards, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 persons.
Protesters in the city claimed a medical dictatorship, and vaccinations were referred to as an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have died since the outbreak of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to introduce restrictions on non-vaccinees in Russia.
The government introduced drafts on a single QR code system to the State on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to attend mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retailers with either a certificate of vaccination or transmitted disease or a medical discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

The Olympics must attract millions of people and help to establish international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will bring together the 1 trillion yuan, marked by President Si Jinpin, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward provinces.
The Taivu Mining resort in Zhanjiakou, located near the Winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure in the region, greening is also under way: the workers plant trees.
There are over 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to have international competitions.
There are snow problems in many parts of China where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou.
The main challenge for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting rest at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become immersive.
Before that, however, we are far from doing so.
The Game Advisor, Justin Downs, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to ignorance.
Every year, more and more Chinese are on their way to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, Beijing snowboarder, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a mountain range here, Dauns believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and to provide the necessary rest infrastructure.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunley, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years winter sports tourism has been taking place here.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, there was a rapid railway, and no locals now suffer without work.
The country is opening up more and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
In the slopes, a pancake with national kitchen dishes is opened.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwa now.
China is committed to creating a prosperous winter sports industry, its sports must be the leaders of the largest international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, stated in WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be subjected to extreme poverty because of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has impeded the progress of humanity in universal access to health care, stated in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published by WHO and WB in connection with the International Day for Universal Health Services on 12 December.
They noted that the pandemic had caused health problems, causing undue stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has declined, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In WHO and WB, it was emphasized that the pandemic had caused the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people found it harder to pay for treatment -
This situation is driving more than 500 million people to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the Coronavirus pandemic had led to the poverty of over 100 million people, and that over four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister was disengaged from broadcasting on the Summit for Democracy, at the request of the White House
The statement by the Minister of Digital Technology of Taiwan, Audrey Tan, in a panel discussion during the US-Sammit for Democracy, was translated into a video-free mode, as evidenced by the YouTube event.
The Reuters Agency claims, with reference to sources, that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
They reported that the reason was the map on which Taiwan was assigned a colour from the PRC, which is considered an island of its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African Non-Governmental Organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world to the extent of ensuring civil rights.
Taiwan was allocated as a free green -- and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam as a red -- as closed --
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot noting that the views of the panellists did not necessarily express the position of the United States Government -
The PRC was not invited to the \"Sammit for Democracy\"
Reuters sources point out that the map shown by the Taiwanese Minister might have been contrary to the one - one China - policy pursued by Washington.
One agency source stated that after the map was shown, the U.S. National Security Council had an angry relationship with the State Department, accusing him of what Taiwan had shown to be a separate country.
The Washington-Sammit for Democracy took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as of civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to attend the summit.
During the zero-day summit of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor - New Gazette - Dmitriy Muratov called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption could be committed to charity.
Earlier today, Under-Secretary Sovbes RF Yuri Averjanov stated that the summit was a non-anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge -

You don't have to be in one pile. Bad people happen, you might have claims to them for specific reasons...
But with what number of children, age, pension fund and more?
Write that they're Merzavs, they didn't get the money.
And that's how many children they have, not your business until they're going to hang these kids on your neck.
And since it's off, what right do you have to condemn them?
It's probably just in education so...
The chosen parents dictate their rules in a frank manner, pouring over the existing rules.
What if this were to affect other areas of life, court proceedings, etc.?
No laws are written for them.
And if Dad did not really want to give up on his teaching and education?
There's some sort of example for others that's bad.

China is increasing its prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land crossing points
A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular order to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land passes are located, with a view to further preventing infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the said cities should provide a negative result of the test on nucleic acids COVID-19 received within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who come to the cities where the land passes are located shall, upon arrival, pass at least one COVID-19 test on nucleic acids.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the day when provincial administrative units will identify and publish the areas of these cities until 15 March 2022.
It is also noted that cities with land crossings that meet certain conditions can consider the possibility of creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

Pen Balance is a modern material that is derived from the PPU.
The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.
This is why foam is widely used in industry.
Its irrelevance and reliability have been confirmed by a special certificate obtained in Europe, where Russian demands are considerably harsh.
Another important quality of the Foam Balance is its orthopedicity: the material maintains the right human condition throughout the entire period of sleep.
As a result of the matras' foam, it is less than average; hence, the product is considered to be sufficiently soft.

In the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a report on the emergency situation between Russia and the United States of America was presented.
The MIDs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Ryebkov, interviewed by Izvestiya, assessed the prospects for Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, and in some way the improvement of relationships is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road that we have taken with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
It wasn't yesterday that the problems began, says the diplomat.
According to Riyabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose many approaches on Russia.
The MID Zamchales added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improvement and would not expect a change in Washington ' s position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there had been no progress.
In doing so, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned against being vaccinated by a COVID outside hospitals
For those who have a name vaccine, COVID-19 may have allergies and medical care, so the first points for vaccination should not be organized at airports or malls.
TASS was informed by a virologist, a correspondent member of RA, at the University of New Siberia, Sergei Netesa State University, of the laboratory of bio-annotology, microbiology and virology.
It is easier to set up vaccination centers with a name vaccine at airports and malls, but I would only do it at first-time medical facilities.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is available is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that operate literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, says Necess.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccinations in shopping centres when experience in using the drug was gained.
He also stressed that using a nasal vaccine, it was important that it be treated with a mucous lining in the nose.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nose attached to it is shrunk after injection.

In Britain 1,239 cases of omicron strain coronavirus - RT to Russia were recorded per 24 hours
In Britain, 1,239 cases of new omicron strain of the Coronavirus were identified per day.
Sky News informs us.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the micron strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new form of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new strain in Britain reached 3,137.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
President Dmitri Peskov, Spokesman of the Russian Federation, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russia sanctions in the event of continued aggression against Ukraine, including due to alleged incursions into the territory of the country.
“Some restrictions are imposed on Russia and no suffering is possible alone” was made by the official representative of the Kremlin on television - Russia.
Peskov says it's the \"understand all in the world\"
Previously, it was reported that the United States viewed the possibility of anti-Russian sanctions in the energy field as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will make the conversion of rubles into dollars more difficult for Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund.
But the head of Sberbank, Hermanne Greff, is sure it's impossible.

The people of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French BFM.TV broadcast this report.
96.5 per cent of the vote was against independence.
The independence of France was 3.51 per cent of the South Pacific Archipelago population.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate for that day was very low, with about 55 per cent of the archipelago population coming to the sites.
The experts were of the view that the low appearance was due to calls by the separatists to renounce their participation in the referendum because of the Coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against the independence of France.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported finding an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration provides that the region may vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO has previously considered the Omicron to be less dangerous than the Delta-
The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken the preliminary view that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta strains of the Coronavirus.
However, data are available on the reduction in vaccine effectiveness in the new COVID-19 option.
According to the report at 9 December, OIC is registered in 63 countries.
“Preparation data and the significantly altered antigen profile of protein strain micron” suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that the severity of the disease - i.e.) may be less severe than that of the pri-delte - is stated in the WHO technical report.
The Organization notes that, so far, all recorded cases of microbial infection have been easily or unsymptomized in the EU.
However, the new strain is spreading faster - deltas according to preliminary data -
Two cases of omicron strain contamination have been reported in Russia.
They were previously immunized, reporting the Hamalaya Center.
The head of Rosprodnadzor, Anna Popov, claimed that there was no reliable evidence so far that the new version of the Coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

There are four scenarios in Ukraine for Zelensky
Vadim Denisenko, an exputate of the Supreme Council, listed four development options for President Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without support from the West and might also compromise the Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko described this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, denizenco called the perfect storm, implies that Ukraine will no longer support key western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“The price of the key goods that we traditionally export has been reduced by way of internal protests and power resistance with key FMGs (financial and industrial groups). “Red.”) added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenco, there is another scenario of the situation - a war against all -
This forecast will occur in the event of a high degree of turbulence in global politics, where the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership can compromise the Donbasa, which may result in domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky ' s position is weakened, with the former Nardep being reported to be up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third way in which the situation develops in Ukrainian politics is against the dissenting population groups in Zelena and the President, which is why the capture of control of the force and the implementation of populist initiatives -
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky would begin to reform the authorities by adding Denisenko.
Another scenario is the conversion of the Zelenski to the father of the nation -
This could lead to some event that would be a major shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and increase Ukraine’s support,” said Denisenko.
This option of developing the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or Russian aggression.
At the same time, the Russian side has more than once rejected any possibility of attacks on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity within Russian borders.
Previously, on 11 November, data from the Sociological Group - Rating showed that the Ukrainian President ' s rating had fallen to record low values of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of the Head of State.
Analysts have predicted that in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine, only 21.8 per cent would be cast for Zelensky, whereas in the case of the President of the country of Petra Porošenko, 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of those interviewed expressed support to the President.

Arrested by action on Red Square poet: \"For the quote of Evtushenko 10 days give, here she is, the power of poetry\"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenko was arrested for ten days.
The HSE student was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which was inscribed a hashtag of #poetoursilargempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenia Euthusenko.
A report on the administrative article on the re-infringement of the public action was prepared at Alexander.
He was first arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexei Naval.
“The aim was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and it is now, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the culture in Russia and also a small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag — Alexander explains.
We contacted a young poet to clarify the circumstances of his detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How did police officers treat you when you were arrested this time and again?
What did you ask the department for, how did you comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the arrest as polite as it might sound in some context.
In Pushkinsk, the U.S.A. was taken by the U.S.S.
Asked for standard reasons.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if they didn't approve, they understood.
Except for all four of the monkey's swings, everything was extreme correct, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if, after an action under this hashtag, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I can't see those 10 days.

It's a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angel Merkel speaks very well in Russian and yet uses the aid of an interpreter.

Researchers told how potatoes help combat age violations
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that improve the flow of blood and lower cholesterol.
Roots contain group B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help to function as systems of the body.
Potatoes also help to combat age violations.
It is useful for the gastrointestinal tract because of its large content, and during regular use it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
For the most good, however, it is better to carve or cook instead of roasting on butter.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetics, as did other foods with a high glycaemic figure.
These are carbohydrates products that are rapidly broken down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Commersantá warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in production in personal farm facilities and an increase in processing capacity.
Market participants felt that only imports could be replaced by a shortage of products at the moment.
Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex issue.
Efficacy Candidates
In 2015, rights-holders from the Cluster-RAEC/Media made a list of the top 100 runnet pirate sites and most of them ceased to exist, says the Director of the Internet Research Institute Karen Kazarian.
But some people -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- have survived because of the regular change in the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available for search extradition by both Yandex and Google, we can look at the pirate copies of Netflix - the game of squid - and Naughty - the director of Anna Melikan - the original series of the largest video ivi in Russia.
In Kinogo, which is also available for search purposes, you can watch Encanto's animation news, but according to the video quality, it's a so-called screen.
The Filmx, which can also be found through searches, is available in the Univer series. 10 years later, the TNT TV channel.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday - Actual chamber -
The goal of five-year missions is to assess the suitability of the clouds of Venus and then to search for life there.
For the project, tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
To date, it has been assumed that the cloud of Venus nearest the planet is too acidic to have life there, but probably originally Venus was an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the basic question will be whether it looks like an earthly one or it's different.
If it looks very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not originate on Earth.
If it's different, it might be more likely that life was born on Earth -- the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project -- Michkel Paussala.

Meta-inclusional change in Russian business
The theme of the masculinity was popular this fall of the year when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this was an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new digital format for human interaction.
Therefore, business in Russia, as throughout the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-population and its subsequent coining.
Meta-population should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards remote interactions in the pandemic is that people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is the desire of business to develop ecosystems and to adapt operational models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalizing assets when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, the change in diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want to eat too fat or too harmful.
Of course, we're going to have traditional olives and sedatives under the coat, but no one's gonna make me eat all at once.
You can eat on the bed, try it, and stop.
After all, it is true that ten weekends are ahead, and every tasty and useful meal can be prepared.

British economist failed to forecast 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to forecast the year 2022 because in his opinion it would be a failure.
He wrote about this in the Project Syndicate article.
The expert believes that the next year will be filled with unpredictability and any trend can change.
The Coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, and second, inflation is believed to be the case.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether rising prices for goods were temporary or not.
According to the expert, even before the pandemic, it was clear that the world of the never-ending generosity of central banks had grown old - and it was time to return to relationships where inflation interest rates would correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of more than mild economic policies might, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, productivity growth as well as poverty and climate change, was summarized by O'Neill.
Previously, the head of the Global Research Division, “Investigation of Investment”, Michael Schulgin, reported that the dollar expectations for the year 2022 remained positive, with growth potential being smaller.
One of the risks for the dollar was the monetary policy of the Fed, the evolution of oil prices and the fear of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing makes me happy is that if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There's progress, but it's too slow.
There is still a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.

The Russians gave approximately 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to the auto dealers.
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion roubles on new vehicles, 28 per cent more than last year, the Agency's statistics on the Russian Automated Market Research (NAPI) show.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State in support of citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of Heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
By income in the market, Russia has been lead by the Korean brand Kiya.
During the 10 months of this year, it managed to carry a total of 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than in the previous year.
The native Kiya brand of Hyundai has an increase of more than 35 per cent and the car sales benefit is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand increased by almost 21 per cent, to 1.94 million roubles - only Chang, Cherey, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
In addition, the sales of Korean brands did not rise much: according to the statistics of the car manufacturing committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia had, in quantitative terms, implemented 9.4 per cent more than a year earlier over the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12 percent.
The Russian people spent 275.5 billion roubles in 10 months, 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75%) - the German premium brand grew both by 37 per cent and the average weighted car price (almost 28 per cent to 8.2 million roubles).
Mercedes-Benz at the same time saw a good increase in sales and averaged prices - more so than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity - explained the Director of NAPI Tatian Arabaji.
At the pace of sales growth, the fiction indicators show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year -
The Russian Lada is showing average market values (plus 28 per cent), and the Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on their cars in 10 months.
At the financial capacity level of the past year, companies whose sales in goods fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, among others.
OAS and all in the past — within 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on the off-roads and pick-ups of the stamp, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of autocomponents and production disruptions covering the entire world ' s road traffic, motorists continue to adjust prices continuously - the same AutoVAS - increased the value of the Lada models seven times a year, the last trip (an 8 to 10,000 roubles) in late November.
Pricers and other automakers regularly copy.
The amount of Russia ' s car market in monetary terms will continue to increase, in addition to lack of machinery, its contribution to inflation, as well as its willingness to pay off past losses, is considered by experts.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many of the auto concerts have even been able to transfer to the consumer in part the costs of past periods, which they could not put in the price of cars before,
Says analyst - VTB Capitala on the street Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, motorists feel very good at this time, supporting a high margin of sales --
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the cost of cars observed during the year 2021, and the price of new cars increases faster than inflation, the expert points out.
In the long run, the market will grow in quantitative terms and in monetary, but mainly through inflation and complexity of the machinery itself, and is projected by Bespals.
As the supply increases, the opportunity to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the increase in the cost of cars slows, the automakers will be able to earn their income at the expense of the volumes, notes the independent consultant on the Sergei Burgazlie highway.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient supply, the motorists are now seeking the greatest profits from each car sold, notes Burgazlie. -
The increase in the production of machinery is not expected to be a minimum in the next six months, and the future insecurity of citizens in Russia is being heated by the heating industry.
Against the background of the market situation, cars were a good target for investment -- a vehicle bought a year ago, even with a run -- can now be sold more than the original value, the expert points out.
Baiden spoke of the U.S. military transfer to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered the sending of U.S. military personnel to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia.
President Joe Byden of the United States made this statement.
“There have never been any such plans,” said the head of the White House, answering the journalist’s question as to whether the United States had given up such an idea.
Baiden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation surrounding Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the use of United States troops unilaterally for the defence of Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Baiden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would move forces to the eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Czech Republic).
“We will have to send more American and national troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all of the NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia” said Baiden.
Previously, President Dmitri Peskov of Russia’s press secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
He indicated, however, that Moscow saw a problem in the military use of Kiev by the Drones assigned by Turkey, as well as in the fact that the U.S. armament is approaching our territory -
