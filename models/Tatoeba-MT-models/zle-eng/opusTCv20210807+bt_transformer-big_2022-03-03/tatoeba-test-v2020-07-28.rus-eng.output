Is it for sale?
I'm getting meaner.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.

You should get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.

What Alice encountered while waiting for an answer was a sudden howl. It was a loud noise, so sharp to break her eardrums, and so loud to reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As soon as he wakes up, he will respond.

Why would Tom do that?
There are 20 floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Will you give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait.
There was a strong wind.
Tom did not have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can be relied on.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a premonition that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.

Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom has small moustaches.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in a foreign land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
I want to talk about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it very often.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who is your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What are you wearing?
From milk you can make butter, cheese and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When drinking water, do not forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
Not a single snowflake in a snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve the problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's just a spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was tricked.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who is Tom playing with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a really bad idea.
Tom is taller than you.
Tom had no trouble finding a job.
Is this book publicly available?
Could you please speak louder?
I'll tell Tom to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please contact me, only Yakov Matveevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new Stevie Wonder album?
I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay my rent.
Tell me where you went.

What color do you associate your childhood with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.

It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," Tom said.
Where you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?

The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You have to find another way out of this situation.
Disappear.
Are you sure you want to do this?

How do we do it?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them come in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.

I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna come over to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking of trying similar things.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I cook grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.

You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.

Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike is gone.
The stars were shimmering in the night sky.
I don't think Tom will win.
“Oh, we’re not so boring here.” “Oh, my boy, everyone is trying to get a gun to this world...” “Here I am! Your Majesty, Ganon and his servants have captured the island of Koridai.” “Hmm. What can we do?” “How can we not?” “How is it written, only Link can defeat Ganon.” “So what can we do!” “How can we get our sword?”

He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.

Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.

Are you sure Tom can do that?
“F” is a record of Newton’s second law.
What do you have against her?
He likes to sing.
I have to clear some tails.
Is Tom okay?
I said yes.
Fortunately, today Tom is much better than yesterday.
I don't know much about Tom.
I can't pay him today.
Since I'm rocking the press every day, you can finally see its relief.

You don't eat, you die.
We want to make learning effective, interesting and exciting.
I'll protect you.
I live on Park Street.
It's best for you.

Are you planning on staying for a long time?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There is a large garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The gate was open.
I brought wine.
I'm unpopular.
This is his first day at school.

I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
Are you looking for this book?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is it drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was not able to attend his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he did not go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.

I'm sorry, I misunderstand you.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're the same age as her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?

I don't have to take it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We are asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song to me.

You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day at work.

He had cancer.
It's your own fault that this happened.
It's as accurate as a clock.

Everybody having fun?
Tom watches figure skating on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep outside tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how to do it?
It's amazing, isn't it?
I shrugged my face.
The school is just a five-minute walk away.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Can you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.

It might come in handy.
Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, isn't it?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom began to cry.
Put a muzzle on her.
He would never lie to me.
She wasn't sick.
I was trying to be nice.
He deliberately missed so he wouldn't kill me.
Do you think I would change my mind?
Tom is an Australian citizen.
Did you buy them?
Tom just looked at Mary and smiled.
I gave them my old coat.

I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to get by with these old ones.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't spend the whole day here.

Don’t blame others for your mistakes.

They took her.
Mary could do it if she tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.

We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I get an account?

Mary wore two sweaters.
If you see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to hire them.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
Were you born there?
I'm not hearing that anymore.

The butterfly was flying.

Today, I'm finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love winter.
Show me her picture.

If I can do it, so can you.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
