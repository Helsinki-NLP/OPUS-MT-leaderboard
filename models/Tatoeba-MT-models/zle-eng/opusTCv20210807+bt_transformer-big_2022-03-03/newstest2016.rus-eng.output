The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of travel privileges in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region has been changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of travel privileges in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changing.
So, the replenishment limit is now set not in travel, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card in cash remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it becomes possible to keep a detailed record of spending money on a social card with an accuracy of kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return credited but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier the budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips using a social card were made in the region, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using the social card provided for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend
During a 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a high school teacher, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb said there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said the family's contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly written by hand on a white sheet of linden paper: “I’m sorry, I would like to bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who has ever loved me,” the note reads, according to organ officials signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who ran two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State Police Chief Lynne Baford said university officials learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to piece together Lamb’s motivations.
The information shared by investigators in both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to make a portrait of a talented, but perhaps worried teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" he had crossed paths with in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying that he has some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university admissions rules meant that Lamb's doctorate, which he had worked so hard for, would not have guaranteed him an automatic teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber detachable pistol in the back yard of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metal Johnson said.
His engine-powered car was still on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and has taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences degree in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun person.
Carla Hayrston said she was 15 and Lamba was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play guitar for years.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around,” says Hayrston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the other side of which overlooks the canal.
Police say the dog is fine.
Prentiss’s ex-husband, Sean O’Steen, revealed that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," O'Stin said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in the suburb of Gauthier, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss was on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and mouth harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was assisted by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that Lamb’s call came to 911 after Schmidt’s murder, and also in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and children’s goods retailer assuring it will give full-time and temporary employees more hours to work.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, down from the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about dating Princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" turned out to be a grandiose event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and then it dawned on me - Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary “Back in Time”.
The film begins, and then it comes to my mind that I am literally at arm's length and in one fake yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film “Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “it’s unquestionably the greatest time travel movie that’s ever been made.”
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in weaponry will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation intractable.”
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they showed in addressing the issue of Iran’s nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Isn't Joking
Some have tried to label him a provocateur.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the results of polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s double-digit advantage, and some are starting to ask seriously what this means for a real estate mogul in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to the growing popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Political Action Super Committee and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump’s unremitting power and are beginning to pull out their dollars to tip him over.
Here are some survey numbers that suggest a real estate mogul isn’t just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathy for trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators gain the upper hand in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would accept Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “excited” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be “unsatisfied” or “disappointed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington post poll conducted Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he’s the same person who could be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he’s not the type of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their hats of connoisseurs, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as compelling.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits point out that such a spread is likely to play to Trump’s advantage, and at the same time, Trump’s supporters are evenly distributed among the supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a draw with Ted Cruz.
Is he the only candidate who can get away with it?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Still, Trump’s most intense competition so far is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to pick Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s posturing will alienate key Latino voters from the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration continues to attract attention, it looks like Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment from the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, 10 Republicans said they wanted a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 on the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision yet on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why is it that the eyelids are often irritated and blush?
Answers ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet wipe for the eyelids;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleaning procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), liquefying the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingertips;
washing off makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear scientists have created an atomic warhead.
North Korea says the country’s main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity.”
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK at any time is ready to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in both quantity and quality."
The last nuclear test was conducted by North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that it has managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium-range and short-range missiles, writes Polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the state Duma, reports “Russian news service”.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all quatrains, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to “God Save the Tsar”, and the Russian tricolor replaced by the imperial flag.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to cope with the problem of refugees, then they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on the problem.
“This is the essence of the refugee issue,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can’t implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
We will remind, in the EU for this year arrived about 500 thousand migrants, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic state”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become the leader in hosting refugees, although it has recently tightened border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that around 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts say the numbers are significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90 thousand refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in a session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the session of questions the Prime Minister is expected with great impatience
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will speak to the Prime Minister for the first time soon, taking action with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be addressing the first of the six questions this afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely followed by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he may miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as leader; it will come after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silent while performing the national anthem in the service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative MPs and became the subject of several front-page articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “a pile-up” in the Labour party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment to a position in the European Union and the government’s restriction of compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn said at the Tread Union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions in general.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister of labor and pension payments, said there was "complete clarity" in the party that it was opposed to only the government's plans to cut the upper limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the Courier Box in the last ten years since becoming Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has “mobilized collective resources” to gather ideas for Mr Cameron’s questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Eilington North County said that the Prime Minister's questions are causing unnecessary confrontation, and that he will refrain from witty answers and sharing thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the economy minister in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on Prime Minister issues when he was absent - for example, when Mr Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying he had approached House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
Having become a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of the "fairy-bargain" often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure of questions, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have been a key indicator of the leader’s views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.

Pound sterling rises as UK wages rise
The pound has risen against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to a proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as an early postponement of forecasts for possible growth of quotations.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $ 1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro, amounting to $ 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
SABMiller shares stood out against the general background, which grew by 20% thanks to a purchase offer received from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares rose 0.9% on the back of encouraging news from a rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China — in a key market for Burberry — began to grow again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it was able to get $ 2.5 billion through the placement of shares, which was done as part of a strategy to reduce debt.
Mondi’s paper and packaging group shares were leading the decline in the index — by 4.3% — after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group’s rating to “sell.”
JD Sports shares rose after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax profits for six months to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports Chief Says Higher Salaries Could Hinder Expansion
Peter Coughill, chief executive of JD Sports, said raising the minimum wage for British workers meant “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi’s onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A wholesale food supplier has launched a grassroots campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi’s upcoming $700 million infusion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events like the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as ice cream maker Simmo's of Dunsboro, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted regular customers tickets to South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day that this wholesaler of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to follow the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South and 24 percent in WA, compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products at a high level of constant costs Metcash can cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, said Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading stock manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed to those present at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass' comments.
But a Metcash board member is believed to have contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s food business revenue, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths on a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers in the reorganization of marketplaces, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price equalization and retail space conversion are gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kirios and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often referred to as "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself in the spotlight due to Kirjos' shameful altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge at the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating: "Wavrinka should have laid on the shoulder blades of Kirios, and I should have laid on the shoulder blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has loyally defended Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second behind Bernard Tomich in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
“I am very concerned about one thing, namely that Tanashi was drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
He really broke the racket when he lost his leg at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes fell apart, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he’s trustworthy.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, fits in well with the team, he’s never had a problem with other players, he’s respected outside the court, he’s trained hard, he’s in great shape, he’s a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kirjos for an important match starting Friday, believing "mutual agreement" was the right way out for everyone, but counting on the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not on the disputes around [Kiriosa],” Healy said.
And I think that Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to get him out of the spotlight for a while so he can reflect on them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detains those who are trying to enter the country illegally to curb the flow of migrants.
There were riots on the border - hundreds of migrants gathered on the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Trapped indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland set up tents and settled in the area.
However, discontent grew.
When a police helicopter was circling over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared it “unacceptable” to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached under which EU member states will accept another 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis sweeping the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect any quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main bottleneck and border crossing point of the European Union for IDPs, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, and not refugees - victims of hostilities, who have the right to protection, and this point of view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for those accused of human trafficking.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been observing the presence of heavily armed servicemen with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said 45 people had been caught trying to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passes on the border with Serbia, driving a railway car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passes.
Riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service room to let people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, with thousands of people left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced a refusal of food and water until they are allowed into Hungary.
2016 Election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders comes in second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is going to run for president, is supported by 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contest, a majority of Democratic voters say it is too early to say whether they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has declined.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
Clinton’s preference for Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party’s candidate.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it just because it is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that now is the time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about the association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called the agreement on issues and the chances of being elected.
As the vice president contemplates potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race — though a third believe he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the candidates from the party, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden is much behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
The majority believes Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no definite opinion about him on this score.
Democratic primary voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email and server credentials while she was secretary of state continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation on the matter and believe it has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But that’s a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided about this back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy over email has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points down from last month, and 15 points down from May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush are the best at honesty.
Most see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates won half of the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump en masse, whose percentage of support rose from 23 percent in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found Carson enjoys support across all demographics, ousting Trump in a group of Republican voters with a college degree.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, a poll conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson’s growth in polls — showing support for 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several critical remarks about the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College Freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during a rite of passage in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was brought against five people.
“Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at New York Baruch College brutally assaulted Chan “Michael” Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him on time to the hospital, which led to his death,” the police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back were pushed several times as he tried to reach the target while walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited another hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the fraternity members began to hide personal possessions, essentially putting the fraternity's welfare above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He could not be rescued and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso, and hips.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of initiation rituals as at least one student is killed during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr Meng, will be charged with assault and conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that authorized all this officially or informally, then it is her,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
In economics, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for as much as 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the US Central Bank is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a comment to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal, but still low, levels to be the seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for rates to rise can lead to volatility for a while.
With an increase in the rate, however, the consequences are usually not as dramatic.
“It doesn’t look like stock returns have slowed down 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market has been changing dramatically over the past 35 years — about 14 percent — toward higher rates, staying fairly flat for 250 days afterward (average 2.6 percent growth), then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, chief stock trading strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, a public.
Deutsche says that the outcome for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the stage of raising rates, and earnings from stocks begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the entire existence of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, even though it held at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed data.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "whether this time will be different," Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve all year round, with their eyes fixed on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve rate hikes at this meeting, futures trading suggests only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all rate hike cycles to date have been in a super-cycle of increasing fiscal leverage with GDP overlapping the peaks preceding recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, a total of 74 months and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks, when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the yield changes vector immediately after the first rate increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategy experts at Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will cause long-term and short-term bond yields to converge, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still wary of fluctuations in yields,” says Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
It is interesting that Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the policy of the Federal system.
In general, companies doing their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks show above-market performance within three months of initial rate hikes,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with a stable financial position outperformed those with an unstable position as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as stocks with low volatility, also performed better than low-quality stocks by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with high floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Depositors could see gains through higher returns as well, although experts differ on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham Criticizes Station for ‘Reducing Standards’
It is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is just ripped off with Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who lashed out at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the leader of MPs said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public radio station appeared to be “stupid” and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, look like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 I'm not learning about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and making music is really no match for anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations have to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC brainchild to be attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of 22 million pounds.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was done in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed as much as possible in August, and the reason for this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since it was first observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago through the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help contain spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of only five percent.
Experts say that now there are signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation,” Andy Malcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in any setting, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming to the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rushed to computers to take advantage of lucrative offers, bringing down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers get into a real battle for profitable purchases, could have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and Bin Laden’s family is sanctioned
Muslims carry bodies of 29 dead in streets as first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapse.
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the crane collapse on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral filled the roadway to pay tribute to the first of the dead to set off on their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were given out for funerals, and at the same time, the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the bin Laden family for the accident, in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the collapse of the crane in the main mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane was not working.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by state-run Saudi Press, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane falling into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked in order to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been part of Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and leads major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a traitor, whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said there were 158 people in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores nationwide
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say that the British put aside hammers and paint brushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or deftly paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company-owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform simple work around the house.
Veronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home improvement services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in goods for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 stores-warehouses B&Q.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten store shopping decisions are made by women.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past.
Ms Laurie said: “Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of leading UK companies listed in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the adoption of the most important decision - to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who believed last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe that it will delay and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and begin the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a leading employee of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is operating efficiently, the economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned markets that they should prepare for change, but everything indicates their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" chanted hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to displaced people.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other is via Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses, which transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary, are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia safe as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people and ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is a common European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone will not cope with this, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone calls himself a refugee, he must fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because in Serbia it is quite safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: “Europe wants to help us”
Vangelis Meimarakis has been part of center-right governments for a number of years, leading, according to the left, the country to a financial crisis.
Now that he is interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the Syriza coalition, but now, judging by polls, New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation was improving, and this applied to the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement the program by which they have reached agreement, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you honor that agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences of the country’s exit from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr Tsipras’s handling of the negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during its first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to a recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example related to farmers’ income.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014 we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have pushed reform forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that satisfied the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential election.
Euronews: In recent weeks, there has been a massive influx of refugees across Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act ahead, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And we are in that situation now.
Even the provisional government that succeeded SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the president of the republic, who called for an EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance that we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, within a day, the criminal investigation officers of the Main Directorate of the militia of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who the night before during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and the resulting conflict in the village of Verkhnetoretskom Yasinovatsky district of Donetchyny shot his rifle.

The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta, left a note with an apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "regrettable" about the first murder and would like to "get everything back," authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, report that a geography and social science professor at Delta State University called 911 at around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "wouldn't hurt anyone," but was probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm sorry I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who's ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and killed himself on Monday night when he was surrounded by police.
The university's rector, William LaForge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported a "lack of any information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen says he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is “inconsolable.”
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
On the evening of the same day, when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to the resume posted on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life partner Farra Fawcett, who died of cancer.
Reportedly, the actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for a few months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, because of which he will not be able to enter the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless pitching in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
The arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad ride with two legs.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote: "Thank you all for your messages, words do not describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even stronger than I was."
Manchester United is going through a misfortune with Luke Shaw at the defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the English will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When any player is out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, you feel bad,” Koku said.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like it (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see the pitch under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
I'm very sad, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Each parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday company about his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but in fact tells the plot of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
“In the high-walled town of Vsemusville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of her dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,” we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seus Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn’t look suspicious enough, Cameron’s text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the movie “Lorax”, posted on the Internet Movie Database: “In the high-walled city of Vsemunouville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dreams.”
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree cutter and all-girl binder, Nakhodkins, is destroying the environment, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is taken out in the title of the book) - a funny creature with a mustache who "speaks on behalf of the trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the performer who never read a child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment followed.
For Adam Lita there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but this is still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the national team that England selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test series last time does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn’t rule out a win on my field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are players among the batters who masterfully take twisted balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Lit dropped out of the England Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Lit to me, his head coach at Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said this before) players choose themselves the best.
A couple of half-hundreds, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own fate.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke well about his attitude, even when he did not show what he is capable of, and this does not surprise me; he is first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of test cricket leaves an impression is a difficult question.
Leet played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best possible shape, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman that I appreciate.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer, as we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of placing Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, retaining four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I am not at all against it.
I don’t see any reason why a batter can’t hit the ball there, and this left-handed player has already shown that he is a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for your county of Worcestershire, but has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a third batsman before coming out as a starter in 2001.
He immediately won three hundred and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a backup spinner, and with my short communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners voting "for" a little, and the selectors chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring her the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new strength to the team.
Colley's teammate, Durham Ben Stokes, was left for one-days, Ruth was given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems with this.
Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
A camp of supporters of Britain’s exit from the European Union could win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron’s ill-conceived policy of restarting negotiations to keep Britain in the EU every day is experiencing more and more difficulties, even without looking at the election of a genius Jeremy- “Is this true or not?”- Corbyn the leader of Labour or TUC’s indignation over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigels Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that given the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own making - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of sowing discord and undermining the agreement changes that they mostly do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any way if they were destroying social protection.
We might even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the tent of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that veiled ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, as she has worsened for Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses his power.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of the way to help the “selfie Brits” whose energy could have been spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK — which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style straps during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the UK’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was a fixed idea" and "Britain got nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical of the EU media tycoons are, in contrast to the referendum launched by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate Euro-opportunist who became famous for his “straight EU bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of tax-fearing crooks, alien phone hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of them quite the same opinion, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a wild gorilla, you must give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more of a Blair supporter than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair reneged on principles in favor of an abrogated EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But the cute Jeremy Corbyn who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he didn’t have time to spend it on me anymore — seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock’s “Boycott Murdoch” strategy from the 80s — a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and the wider circle of "small England supporters" among the Tories can probably say yes to this.
That's the same thing Hilary-"Benn, but not Bennite"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the tolerable John McDonnell as "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old dad was struggling on TV for disloyalty to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. told peers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the Democrat and “boyfriend” Corbyn wants to say — remember, he touched even me — the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24/7 television, and especially in the whirlpool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to take Labour’s support for the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s main misconception about EU membership — within the “Bennite” economy of the besieged fortress — is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by minor distinctions, is a central tenet in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato — Tom Watson is unshakeable that J.K. will not campaign for an exit — foreign diplomats will be required to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain, when all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during a luncheon at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize Public Health England review of e-cigarettes
The government-funded agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE released an important report last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In a BMJ paper, two other researchers wondered whether these claims have “solid or flimsy grounds.”
Martin McKee, a lecturer in European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capwell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health is that rules should be based on evidence of efficacy.”
According to them, the public expects PHE’s claims that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco” to be based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis model in order to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certifications in the health sector in a sustainability report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding it had reportedly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of council members has not been provided, but among them there are several prominent proponents of e-cigarettes, some of whom have also claimed industry funding in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have experience in managing tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department at PHE.
The research paper, published by the group, "exquisitely agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of harmful effects of most products by most criteria," McKee and Capwell wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capwell said PHE's claims that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s statements had previously been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS ?2 billion a year.
By making it clear that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are doing our job for the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the series EastEnders
Luke Johnson, former head of Channel 4, said the BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service broadcasts, which only a small portion of the audience is likely watching, at peak airtime when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had tried unsuccessfully to establish cooperation with the BBC while working on Channel 4 for six years.
“I can’t help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programs that could show competing companies not receiving subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s quest to find out the future.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should only leave on the air those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice is broadcast in the prime slot, because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ludicrous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give a lot for it.
I don’t understand how this could be public service.
I don't think that would be a disservice to the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky's chief executive Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh offered the BBC to sell EastEnders-type series.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC public service broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in hypocritical sermons justifying the income from licensing fees of 4 billion pounds: "well, yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favor of "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that only a small portion of BBC production is now formally classified as educational - he said that it is 1% television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
Regarding the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade Concerts" (only part of them, according to him, is shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have brought out worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses that are too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses have an impact by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Next Next post: Researchers Control Brain Activity with Light
The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
The technique is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain through the optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves freely pass through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery it is not necessary to pass inside the cranial box.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Banned torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International video protesting the arms exhibition.
Awesome drone killers!
Ruining shin iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
A cheerful voice and drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody, prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government to “push” weapons to repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defense technologies and security systems held at the ExCeL center in Docklands.
DSEI Arms Show: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
"An important announcement traveling on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line, which turns into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come across the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them across London using the “Advertising Location Hacker Kit,” a 6-pound set of wrench keys that allegedly “gives access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet.”
London transporters are not happy about such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms show welcoming passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono VCCP agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show — with a omission in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating a more realistic and clever corporate ad, but “filling it at home with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting.”
“They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about the order for the AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting, received from the US Army.
It includes an “unparalleled cumulative warhead that brings unrivaled armor action inside the target.”
No matter what he does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it’s only now that I remember the strained smiles of those I irritated — and the numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from mildly nerve-racking to absolutely frightening.
He encourages people to talk: to tell you where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you "honestly, I don't love, I hate Marmite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAH, I'll be in my room."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas and places of common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and mend their underwear.
Next Next post: Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a shelter, but many hostels form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It could be hell for someone trying to regain strength.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can restore the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: If the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
As you begin university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, probably, your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly molded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat would rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, misappropriating someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft to take a little milk for tea?
Take care of the milk owner.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat this as an adult than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to take revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to reduce the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, and then slammed her music and locked the door behind her, going to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before biting your elbows, awkward if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away by him, broke off the relationship and should see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, the heart will not order - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own ardor a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and harassment is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, choosing General, and then Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "App update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides, or try to upgrade through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may involve removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified execution with a special utility that offers to remove apps and re-install them after the process is complete.
Make sure your phone is charged or near the charger when you upgrade to prevent the battery from discharging.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the upgrade, as discharging the phone in the process can cause the upgrade to fail.
iOS 9 comes out as planned, despite the delay WatchOS iOS 9 review: the least impressive and best update to iOS 9: how to prepare for a new operating system for the iPhone
You should make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of the actions you need to take before downloading to try and make something stop going wrong, and protect yourself from that something if it went wrong. iOS 9 now includes new features, including an advanced personal assistant, and innovations that improve iPad performance, as well as settings that increase speed and fix the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad leads only to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, PJ Media writes.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made clear that Russia’s continued support for President Assad poses a risk of escalating and prolonging the conflict, and has a negative impact on our shared goal of fighting extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power,” the State Department said in a statement.
Kerry also reiterated the U.S. commitment to fighting Islamic State within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in attempts to counter the Islamic State.”
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was set to discuss the matter with Moscow.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the time for a phone call between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: “When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime a “losing bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
“But he didn’t heed my warnings — and things got worse as a result,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to the Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the Federal Customs Service, Rosturizm - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about 200 million euros annually go to the coffers of European countries for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties and taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Lashkina said.
This issue was submitted for consideration by the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of economic development, the proposed measure for full conditional release at importation is inherently a benefit.
Therefore, after approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary to promote foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them are service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and scenery, mobile laboratories and racing workshops.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared mandatory resolutions on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Yevpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport has prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the water area of the seaports of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of coordination, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, which involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht does not even have anywhere to refuel.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then there is a problem where to get it, ”says Denis Novikov, Nordmarine’s sales director.
As for the places for storing yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but since the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $ 500 million
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new financing will support a number of priority measures for reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the report said.
The director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimiao Fan, said that reforms in the banking sector will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan of 100 million euros to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are being asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, they will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies.
This was told to “Izvestia” by a member of the Council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not decided on gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the serving of the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts undergo appropriate medical examinations that prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the pre-trial detention center (where the accused are until the court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
This is the only way to deal with these criminals.
They should definitely be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the staff of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
The humiliation of trances on the part of fellow inmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city is, how many criminals with an uncertain gender, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Individual detention facilities are not exactly needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Grib, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transgender prisoners will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are detained in the pre-trial detention center at the scene of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Grib.
We will remind, on the eve of law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to identify detained for drug possession 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which the man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on a no-show.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, since there is really no mechanism for the detention of transgender people in prisons and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist of LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving sentences by transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alexeyev.
Prisons need to be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a colony different from ordinary ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in colonies for transgender people, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change sex, ”Alekseev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But while there are no separate places to serve a sentence for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues in the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colonies can greatly delay the beginning of the serving of sentences by convicts.
A commission is being created - this is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s mental health options allow it.
Therefore, before the change of sex, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they accurately show whether a change of sex with surgery is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, then we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and there are quite a small number of those who have such a deviation and still commit crimes, ”Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgenders and so can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the world championship in chess among juniors up to 20 years.
The end of the race was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and they became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Douda, who seemed to confidently go to the title.
At the girls the victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently seized the lead.
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the gap, seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda your party.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok, to complete his party.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a confrontation with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, it was to him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the competition of girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she did with success.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second behind the champion in 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to the general director of VimpelCom, Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are carried out in order to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce “ten percent” of personnel in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the institution on Bolshaya Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
43 diners violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for ventilation, bacteria of the Escherichia coli group were found in some institutions.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, owner of the chocolate chain Alexander Kolobov, 293 eateries operate in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the department is against indexation of 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
At first, they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much stricter” proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on shares for the full amount of $ 300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the share price in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand a surcharge.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing an order for the rehabilitation of developers.
“We understand that there is no escape from this, so we are developing an appropriate mechanism,” the official said.

The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card".
I would like to especially note that we should not confuse the proposed food cards with the echo of past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation,” Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, “Kommersant” wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was submitted to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
Being a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s rating.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year’s rating and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of the company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, HR director, CIO, director of public and corporate relations, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is invited to participate in the rating and given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nomination of candidates on the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and timber processing industry, engineering, media business, metallurgy, diversified holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the remaining participants and can put their ratings on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
To the in-person meetings of expert commissions are invited all willing candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years.
Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of top managers and eight commissions for the approval of heads of functional areas.

The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market of lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs has decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could lay in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do it: the rates are already sky-high.
For businesses, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How much do you think the demand for loans is being met?
After the reduction of the Central Bank interest rate, the situation has improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, control the cash flow.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the matter of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not worth waiting.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a decrease in Central Bank rates.
If we talk about the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishment of funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly represent a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese is simply due to its “Japaneseness” is able to bring attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can argue as much as you want in favor of cars from other countries, and people even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
To quote from the course of Base, to spice up wasabi food, collect katana and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is a radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car a new pattern of headlights and taillights, according to which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
Silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of severity.
You don't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-liter diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp is only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black raincoat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to drive the CX-5 you were not at the site of your own accident.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Noise from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It is different if the girl is flaunting in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
It will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal margin of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Long-legged people will surely appreciate that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat the ankles in turns.
Mazda offers the widest range of active safety systems on the CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to detect potential threats.
There is adaptive lighting, and a warning about the descent from the strip, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, having a minimum of projections, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - while each section is equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon character in Japan is called “kigurumi”.
Kimurumi pajamas are particularly hot.
Everything is possible in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk around with such an animal on the street...
After all, it is so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, manner of behavior or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic union.
Kiev has officially formalized Ukraine’s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating an agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill was introduced by the government only with the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted in favor of the draft.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, laid under the USSR, was originally designed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER reactors, but managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2011-2012, the Rada adopted relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the Russian side would have to build blocks on credit, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to wind down relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have remained is the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NNEGC Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans for the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
UN Secretary General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
"There is no military solution," the AP cited his answer to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"There will be a meeting on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
“Anything can happen,” Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, “Kommersant” reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reported on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "return to normal life of our countries."
When asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were made by representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who accused the electoral commission of “covering up falsifications”.
Opposition comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The City Electoral Commission officially presented the results of the elections in the city of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six deputies in the city Duma rely on Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of “Fair Russia” go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he passes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city election Commission Alexander Makeev told members of the Commission that introduces duty for “the distribution of telegrams Zhirinovsky and others” for the purpose of refusing mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation announced multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the city election commission with the right of consultative vote from the CPRF, suggested not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could go inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of commissions with the right of deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend the meetings of district commissions.
The head stopped access to them only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
“Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present,” said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election commission.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that a number of PECs on election day began to seal the ballot boxes at 6-7 am, laying out ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right of consultative vote and observers, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
Communists believe that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the insertion of unrecorded ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from “Fair Russia” Maria Popova through the licker to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
"In the order of your own initiative, contact at least the CEC," Alexander Makeev advised Ms. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, Sergey Samokhin, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, fell on the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election commission ignores dozens of complaints and covers up falsifications in the elections.
"You are not here at the rally, be careful to declare!" - offended the chairman of the election Commission.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the election commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party “Communists of Russia” to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents two questions: do they agree that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be “immediately abolished”, and tariffs for housing and communal services “freeze until 2020”.
However, the Duma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the “Communists of Russia” contradicts the legislation.
FedEx revenue is mixed, with lower forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its forecast for annual profit due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its land transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5% in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to a FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite the increase in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on January 4, and the increase in fees for land transportation of heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans revenue growth compared to last year, thanks to lower costs, higher gross revenue and growth in online commerce.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO, said: “The company has been operating stably given the weak economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade, compared to the forecast.
Labor force hiring plans for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as hired last year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international urgent transportation sector, leading to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transportation unit.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results in the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from ground transportation increased by 29%, but operating income remained unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The Express division received higher revenue due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, revenue fell due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table made of Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room, two stories high, a wall image of the United States will hang over them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And that third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in Thursday’s near-predicted decision whether the U.S. economy is poised to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most data shows robust economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could keep already cautious Federal System executives from adding volatility by raising the base federal funds rate — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Roughly half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted interest rate increases this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator only showing a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
This could cause the stock market to fall if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make the decisions do not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rise was triggered by expectations that policy makers of the Federal System would leave the bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the Federal Reserve Board does that, “they’ll have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that raising the rate could calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system appeared to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in slowly tightening financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest level in more than seven years, and almost at what the federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And, although inflation continues to be below the central bank’s target of 2%, the Federal system’s leadership said the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can and needs higher rates, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average for industrial stocks fell as much as 16% from a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hamper global growth.
The market regained some ground this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, the market disturbance further complicates the difficult calculations of the term for raising the interest rate.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would be tightening the screws at this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the implications might be for the U.S. economy, and they have little reliable data since the recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system, and it should not be taken into account technically when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s financial power.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
Just a hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “stun” its monetary expansion has caused turmoil in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that Federal Reserve officials would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more of an art than a science,” said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lucker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve System of overreaction to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles."
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has caused the Federal System to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth,” Lucker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic did not come close to this level, he said.
“You certainly wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re scared of rising rates because markets are in turmoil,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees pour into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is it not Europe that is the ultimate target of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East with such maniacal persistence in recent years?” he asked.
After all, for sure, someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing from death, will rush to the prosperous EU countries,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “How many political leaders in Europe have spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally engulfing their countries?”
“No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at how military boots, sewn according to NATO standards, trampled and moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker said.
Government forces and their loyal militias are opposed by insurgents, mostly Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The United States supports the rebels, who are opposed to both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus considers such rebels as terrorists.
The President of Syria called the reason for the hostility of the West to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, which will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, then at the request of the people, and not by decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation with them is carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he explained.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if we have a serious desire to fight terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic state”, banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States is striking ISIS positions from the air.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the state Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during his conversation with Kerry, again emphasized the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in the territory of this country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Some bilateral issues were also raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization “Islamic state”.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander against Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of Lenta.ru.
A note in the Washington Post is beautiful in that everything there is completely distorted.
The former defense Minister of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one tied and “exited” he from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very high mood, without ropes, without three trucks of money, which are attributed to him by different characters,” he said.
According to Boroday, the conversation about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper was really going on.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” said the former head of the DPR government.
Boroday stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to Russia “connected”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then these are surprisingly misunderstood words, since I emphasized that Strelkov left himself," Borodai said.
"This is a slander against me and against Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post there was an article in which Borodai said that he took Strelkov to the territory of Russia involuntarily.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers began cutting down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to check the accuracy of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Polish Deputy Culture Minister Piotr Zhuchowski said that local treasure hunters with a “99 percent probability” found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with a message that they found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief drug expert has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugene Brun noted that until this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station “Moscow speaking”, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A person matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21,” said Brun.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project “Sober Russia” Sultan Khamzayev told “Izvestia” that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age limit for the sale of alcohol and “agreed together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again at the site of the upper house of parliament.”
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development”, a correspondent of Sib.fm got acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the “Read-City” store on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law “On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development”.
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor’s office of the city of Novosibirsk.
A response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself,” the applicant commented to Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very fundamental problem that will stir up society.
They will start reading the Bible, which they have never done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of babies sucking breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant women and women who give birth are advised to increase the daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that a calorie boost alone is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, it was found that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents the development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of an unhealthy diet on the immune system of the child was revealed.
Near Hamburg, the train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, there was a clash in front of them.
It was filmed by one of the students.
Because of the emergency situation among the students there was panic.
Some children started crying and running along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, no one was injured, except for one passenger of the train, who was slightly injured.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to a life support device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, - said the vice-president of the organization Stephen Parnis.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The speaker of the state Duma Sergey Naryshkin called unacceptable the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“The two-facedness never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma urged parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be paid tribute.
“This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkov.
He managed to win the European team championship at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking the third place in the overall standings.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Is the season not over yet?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season thawed, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, on "relaxation".
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue at the end of the season always builds up.
It doesn’t matter if you’ve won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moving - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
Of course, my emotions are on the rise.
What's the matter, I'm just happy!
By the time you finish the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I believe that a bad athlete who lives with old victories, scrolls through his successful races over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual one?
I can’t say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
Just like usual.
But with the coach we set the task: to try to reach a new level, which I have not been to yet.
Almost all the winter time was spent on laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises in general physical training, which included traction, and squat, and the back we pumped.
Then they took up barrier training, did a lot of technique.
How are the competitors doing, you know?
I always try to do this, good in the age of the Internet with this there is no problem.
Watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season, you’ve added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
I’ve had the same schedule over the past few seasons.
It's not like I run 13.20 and then I run 13.50.
I’m always slowly moving my form.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that it seems that you feel that you are ready for feats, and it is not always possible to show your readiness at competitions.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not get to the final. - "NO") tried to forget right away.
It was very good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But not so lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Taegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals, there was such a maximum program.
And fell off right from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to tear and to drag a broken head means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win gold already then!
How is it possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to turn off?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so as not to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most thrill when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out by itself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland after the first serious success tend to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's still better at home.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been together with Klevtsov?
Since he was 12 years old, since he came to athletics.
More precisely, I first trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's all-around was - it's when they throw the ball, jump in length from a place...
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, it was possible to fulfill the norm of the second adult category.
He stayed that way.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
I managed to reach an agreement with them immediately.
But there was always a lot of work to be done on the technique.
There's been a lot of pain over one run!
But there is no escape from this routine.
The technique must be honed constantly - so that at night I could be woken up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thanks.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my races, but I couldn't resist.
But we need to work on efficiency - there are no limits to perfection.
Are you not afraid that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you choose this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any additional cargo.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I am not so naive that I was surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them with bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't wrap myself in a flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, I've said it a million times here, and I've never called anyone a bastard directly, I've been touched by something else.
All my pseudo-friends went away in a second.
The pressure I'm being subjected to is so strong that even me, who's seen the kinds of guys, I think the people of the Belen are full.
Like you were walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd and, well, muddle with rods.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'll hit a howitzer, old me, guys, be afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite it out.
And only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a disgraceful job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What happened to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something does not at all fit into the overall picture of the human community.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space...
The war has gone from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have a guess who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don’t understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished his monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting his small homeland.
And now reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise of the Seventh leads the ranking despite the attempts of the Ninth to cover the loss of leaders in Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's foray into Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party's announcement to vacate the leader's seat failed to lift Today's rating much.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
Competitor Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture did not seem to matter much to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise's audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today gained slightly more compared to its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in a strong position with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily surpassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven, luck and failure mixed on the second evening of Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, attracted 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour drew an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat grossed 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second evening will force the Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay McGuire's show.

The three finalists are unanimous that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Markoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them would win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who have reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Markosky and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls are supposed to be left, they may have inadvertently given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the finale, which will be held on Thursday
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell who of them really won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoskey no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy and the energy of Sam and I knew they were very good for each other and I had no doubt about it throughout the show,” Jevons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, there is a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be "the same person."
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game — I believed him with all my heart,” she says.
When asked who should choose Voodoo, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snezhana and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor is set to air on Wednesdays at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarrid Hain had several options to start a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle became very interested in him after he moved to the United States - as well as many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which a former Australian rugby league player allowed on his first punt return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hain another opportunity to regain the punt, and also used it in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself from a good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of making a difference to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hain also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the punt to the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
At this beginning of his debut in the NHL, Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count.
Hayne was seen swearing when he left the field after losing the ball, and he later told the hosts of the Hamish and Andy show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to his career in the NFL.
“It happens, you just think about the next game and that’s it,” Hain said.
Hain compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when a ball throw in his scoring zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.

Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for considering asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found a migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, so he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the transfer of the functions of border guard to the Hungarian armed forces in the near future.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175-kilometer-long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest in the history of the United States cyber attack.
Accused of the largest cyber attack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During a trial in a New Jersey federal court, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy, and national security,” said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, possibly, reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia's support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of fighting extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition,” the State Department said in a statement.
Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to fight the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to him, Assad “will never be able to be a reliable member” of the coalition.
During the phone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest has threatened Russia with isolation if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that police officers used tear gas and then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern, flat Nepal, where representatives of the Madizi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taroo citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 days ago.
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally administered for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of the "Regional".
Oleg Valerievich, how did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of local budget funds.
An audit of the municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document flow to five days.
Previously, paperwork on the instances could go for months.
Measures have been developed to improve the revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting government meeting was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
In the city there was no design and estimate documentation (PDD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started by preparing the PSD for roads, a kindergarten, a northern sewer and a water conduit.
Road works are already underway at two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographic in the city has not been observed for the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most urgent.
Since September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for overhaul.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the repair, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children aged from one and a half to three years.
There are no waiting lists for children from 3 to 7 years old.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be done, first of all, Sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is being commissioned.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing wishing to participate in the program a lot.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes a turnkey finish.
If we manage to cope with the given volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We're working with the D.A. to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig farm, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have about 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented due to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "East-Center", Novo-Ziminsk CHP, LLC "Sayan Broiler", LLC "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly on the Day of the city LLC "Sayan Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of the equestrian courtyard, where specialists deal with children's hypatotherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to celebrate the City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city groups and organizations.
The chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
First builders and people who have made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded anniversary medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was to purchase instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, helping children in need of expensive treatment, supporting children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance to provide specialists with housing.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the ability to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to redevelop the building, which will be built another eight apartments for teachers.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that in the city there is a working team with whom I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Saiyansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rise in prices.
The state Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account rising prices.
The author of the document - MP from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, the OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva stated that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the Assembly’s events are unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
As reported TASS, in support of the position of Kanerva were collected signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
“There’s already a lot of support,” Kovalev said.
Earlier, he said that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention to collect the signatures of deputies who pointed to the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, noted Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the leading structures of the European Union and “send a corresponding petition”.
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent.
The broad front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure region roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, forecasters from Miami reported.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a donation doubling campaign to raise $11 million for aid agencies helping refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, sparked for the most part by Syria’s four-year civil war, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may be helped by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatment.
“Mortality statistics don’t show up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in the JAMA Surgery editor’s column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
Bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes over several years, but the main studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0-Dv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy — with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and in part - 28%.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, only 1% had a complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2% had a partial cure.
In addition, indicators of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors state.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers wrote.
After surgery, average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But better glycemic control scores, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce the mortality rate over five years, according to study leader Dr Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that received the sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study of obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it claims that such surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI falls in the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out a fur coat and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked residents of the Moscow region house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women’s fur coats.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered the house, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article “Robbery”.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to watch the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of Rosbalt believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rental housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now literally every number is on the account, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 one-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development Nana Gvicia, at the moment, only 23 hotels have been classified - so many inspections have been conducted by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by an amazing coincidence is unknown.
That is, there may be more that have been classified, but no one knows about it.
"For the last six months, hotels have not been very eager to undergo classification," Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry, admitted.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets in which the costs of inspections were not laid down, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still recently, hotel managers have intensified and began to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels have until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be developed for a hotel room during the tournament.
Formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order to prevent the rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow an increase of two or three times, but also hotels need to be allowed to earn money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," - said the President of the Russian hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how far this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than a runaway trip,” he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the state Duma introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Gwachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma does approve the bill, then about 80% of hostels will close in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms in them.
According to the president of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there is a lack of two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a skew in the direction of hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when “75,000 VIPs sit in an 80,000-strong stadium.”
This can be fixed by mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban to be "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel that guests come to for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the hole dig itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering work.
“Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from the mini-hotel, and will choose those that are more expensive,” said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of passed inspections at the moment are much higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is due to the constant changes in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if there are not enough St. Petersburg hotels, that will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized to the city, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans are prepared to come in vans in which you can spend the night.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that later they are empty,” Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will enjoy rental housing.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first to leave housing near the stadium," - said the Agency for development and real estate research specialist Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, in which people not only suggest the way, but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the yard - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult at that time with hotels, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
“And my father brought them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the inhabitants of the city - calling to your home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
I looked with admiration at the clowning Zhirinovsky in the State Duma today.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, as it were, is “LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
Protocols do not shake - because there is nothing; other protocols, except those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR, apparently, do not.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And immediately with nothing to attack Rodnina, and then, after a skirmish with the chairman, leads the faction out of the courtroom, shouting literally "You are all with fronts your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Real Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is Zhirinovsky’s next trick in the style of “Bastards!”, and not a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the party website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
Allows the dead on the Amur to bury their own dead, and he preaches against the “United Russia” as a whole and innocent Rodnina.
An elegant solution so that the face does not lose, and not to go into a real, not a show scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
In addition to the screams from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for a narrow circle it was he who became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks against the EP and the ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for a single regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a pariah, which was successfully used by his own party leadership and super-irritator for the same ONF and party leadership of a stranger.
Surely, there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should be invented and respectfully watched.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
I mean, the bathroom fell for nothing.
The only thing Abramov buried under him.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries that are the birthplace of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Ethics Research Centre in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions following the 9/11 attacks, saying that the U.S.’s harsh response has set off a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand sanitizer in the past 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of children under the age of 12 ingesting hand sanitizer fluids reported to toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to come into contact with these substances, and unfortunately, some percentage of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as cheap booze.
The teens reportedly mixed the disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently at school swallowed a strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer in the amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment to the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Naiji's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York conspired to poison their "opposing" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk", and address discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad cast iron owl.
Kids who come for books try to feed her candy.
I have been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances based on Mayakovsky’s poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper “Young Stalinist” wrote in 1939, every day “the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children’s library of the city of Barnaul” became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna did not mind that the library was given her name, she wrote that she did not, does not mind.
The letters have long been dusting in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, indignant: why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick walkway.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olga was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and all the other managers differed only in her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olga made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they increasingly live in some kind of virtual space.
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - says Tatyana Kushvid, director of the library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think my interest in reading is back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library is glad that with children more and more fathers began to come.
If in two years the child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then they come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with verses and eras, the story of Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva", the backing "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the “temple of the book”, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school,” explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can all come together to read, play, draw.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they are stooping with their legs, they do not want to leave.
Often come mothers with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with babies.
Tatyana Kushvid says: modern children just like we once loved classic children's literature:
"Publishing is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations."
And if we talk about small children, then it is important for them that there is some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
Carrying books outside the reading room for adults is prohibited.
Only children have this magical privilege.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the book depository.
The steps will scream under your feet - it's already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you meet like an old friend: hello, it's good that you and I do not change.
Ellie still walks along the road paved with yellow bricks, the lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malcish-Kibalcish never told the damned bourgeois of Military Secret - he has such a firm word.
Books are like passwords, you can find yours anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with verses and eras.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or a 1936 bursary.
Time has aged pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer given to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I all dream - I will retire and deal with rare children's books.
But the children will not behave at this, so to speak: and the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the topics ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write out this “Pioneer truth”?
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository.
The pages of Murzilka have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been in charge of the book depository all her life.
She knows what color Buratino's cap is, what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for the motor, and who Alice Selezneva's father works for.
Little is paid for the work of a librarian, and everyone who can live without these book ranks very quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I generally love children's books: as a librarian I like them to be exactly and beautifully standing on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I am happy when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren ...
Rumor mill: There is no disagreement in Celtic
Griffiths denied the controversy at Celtic after admitting to Dale that the Hoopes were in a bad position, but he would fix it.
Harts will protest the claim of the Scottish Football Association to Neilson, and Warburton is afraid of signing contracts in January that could disrupt the unity of the team.
“Dons” increased the advantage over “Celtic” to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, which allowed the Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths has denied the controversy.
This sparked rumours of controversy at Celtic, which were cut short by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism as they prepared to meet the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a spokesman for Ajax, said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of Celtic's games, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic are going through difficulties, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
After the defeat of “Malmo” and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 players “Aberdeen”, which now, breaking away by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale stated, "The Celtics have had bad periods before and we'll be out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warburton looks forward to January transfers
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
A former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own band this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, who is in contact with Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans ends.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years, and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to confront the SFA about the statements of Neilson
The Harts were tied 2-1 when Paterson was removed and started losing 3-2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not retract his words, claiming, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tyncastle
The stubborn player of the team “Hybernian” received a reprimand after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive words about the former player of the “Hearts” Rudy Skazel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby on Tyncastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was hot,” the striker said, adding: “I can say with confidence that I wasn’t going back to Tyncastle if he wasn’t playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis Council confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly says the Dundee United board remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to come out again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy that "unbeautiful" won against Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to achieve their seventh consecutive league championship victory, which put them five points above Celtic, the top of the standings, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said, "There's no team here that's going to win anything - a cup, or a league championship, that hasn't won meetings like that."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
The number of unemployed in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the 5.5% level in the United Kingdom, figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scotland Minister David Mundell said: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I'm a Witness to the Oklahoma Execution
Today, by evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch as a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on a death row viewing gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossyp is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made back in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more willing than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship after months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
That's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself “could have formulated better”, but still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes glasnost will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I won’t go into details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossyp is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I do believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll watch him die.
I cannot say that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to.
You’ll learn from me what it’s like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
A man being chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
Constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and himself to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to go ashore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday after illegally entering foreign territory in Buckingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to escape them by rushing into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not going out, come on, grab me,'" said Sgt. Shandell Castledine.
Constabulary Lachlan Perhavec didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good policeman."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Sgt. Castledyne.
Football champion Ben Cousins remembers exactly that.
In 2006, Cousins moved into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and attempted to swim Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent a joke "Ben Cousins' biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of spying and threatens to retire from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to inject a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
His target was the stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the start due to a violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always makes every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari’s trial for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He kept his mouth shut over suspicions of spying for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been through it for a long time, but sometimes you get so knocked out that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing my best for them.
When they start thinking that’s not the case, then I’ll need to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I’ll name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to relay information about what I’m doing in my stable,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, they should all undoubtedly file applications because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's becoming personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to hold people other than coaches accountable for what’s going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now might make them think about it.
But I've now come to a point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for their decision-making.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last removal of the horse from the start forced him to state that he could "throw his license to the table".
Moody, best known for training the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medicines on competition day "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's feet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of race rules.
“I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, about which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all know we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed and fled from the scene in Cobram, arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the scene, failure to provide assistance and violation of other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in a stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy counters accusations of rivals in the use of hard power techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball as "putting on the agenda" by two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during Storm's surprise win in the Sydney qualifying finals on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear allusion to Storm after his team won the qualifying final from the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and stated that two of Queensland's teams were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand match.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball with his team and stated that they simply focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything for a whole year in our systems or defense techniques, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s clearly coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing and it’s been a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett about "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was,” said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he sees as impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, as they are somewhat concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game of Storm and Roosters was a competition with more points than the game of Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, this is impressive football?
Or consider the interruptions and unsuccessful attempts impressive?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
Storm have a weekend at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronall Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on $200,000 bail
A man facing life imprisonment for trying to appropriate 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht sailing from South America through Vanuatu and docking in Coomera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for trying to assign drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich’s lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole lot, and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich’s mother and stepfather were offered a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both, it is clear that the $200,000 bail amount is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovic was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, is observed by the police daily and observes a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds"
The head coach of Greece Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match of the 1/4 finals of EuroBasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game,” Katsikaris was quoted as saying by AFP.
We were preparing for a great game in the performance of the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaunas."
CSKA newcomer Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kauna, who left the team, both in defensive constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can cope with it.
Yes, I will need some time to adjust to the position of the center, after all, in the NBA I played more forward.
Now you will need to confront the big center opponent, but I have already done this before, so I think I can do it now.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the Final Four six times, but they have not been able to show their best basketball every time.
There is an opinion that the team was jinxed by someone.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match against Roma will be special”
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face match of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to prove himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, for which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA words Luis Enrique. -
I have very fond memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game that she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: “Krasnodar” has various options for attacking actions.”
Acting head coach of “Ural” Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with “Krasnodar” noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent’s team.
According to the mentor, the "bulls" have in their arsenal several models of the game in attack.
The fight will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with Krasnodar, we will see, - quotes the official website of "Ural" words Skrypchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking actions, conducts its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time, and we are not a slow team, so I believe that it will be a very interesting game.

I’m happy that we didn’t miss the ball and scored four.

I’m not a goalkeeper expert, I’m a goalkeeper myself, we don’t show repetitions of missed goals, so it’s difficult to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used the girl’s phone to get pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to beg for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with an online messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at this address, and found “relevant” queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done so because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend he's a cop to scare them."
Commissioner Eilid Robertson told a sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he made requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had problems with his head when he drank and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw indecent images on the phone, and then the accused was held face-to-face.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and "Plaistation" to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photos of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defendant's lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be listed as a sex offender because it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, pending receipt of certificates from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before the start of hearings on other remaining cases.
He was included in the list of persons who committed crimes of a sexual nature even before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe is giving the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest state leader, fell from a ladder earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall instantly spread through social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by the statements of parliamentary oppositionists that they received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament, a speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innosent Goneze, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
Noted members of parliament were warned that immunity ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing sectors of hardware and service operations.
The estimated job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently is, and the portfolio of business areas will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing previously unachievable end-to-end technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a massive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the U.S., is the latest development in the sector based on the belief that highly specialized companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing against Dinamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery went as planned, there would be nothing to stop him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The saddest thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career"
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with the ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger has also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the past five seasons.
If you look at the situation for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, on account of which the most missed due to injuries days.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while, you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
I hope he recovers physically, I’m sure of it, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so most likely Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will play in the starting lineup.
Wenger may also replace Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the undisputed favorite in Group F, the stadium “Maximir” in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 games since they managed to play last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson of last season, when the team was defeated in the Champions League game by Monaco, and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate men’s need for frankness has become, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to understand the problem, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life declared 2015 the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has enough friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of a cure doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an era where communication is managed by social media, where style is preferred to content, the speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun loving and successful, even if the reality is lonely.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which more strongly affects our mental health.
And, as one billionaire video game maker recently pointed out, money doesn’t actually buy you any more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not through his work, but rather through the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s sighs on Rachel’s — all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal underscores how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often those men who come to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying of “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger, talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Do not guess in advance what benefits friendship can bring.
The Friends series is shown on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, by tag ?FriendsFest
Di Maria score a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates goals scored in the Malmo goal.
Angel di Maria, making his debut in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily beat Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their thing when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmeau at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Paris needed to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, because they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but at continuing the series of successful games of the past three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to bring the opponents problems and play well in defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to improve during the season,” said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret not scoring one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutions in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was pushed back by Di Maria in the background in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to the next level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran out on a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmo's defence and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone then expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the kick of Nikola Jurdzic, in which the ball flew past the long rod of the gate Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
On the other hand, PSG sometimes failed themselves with ineffective transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half alone failed to make at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball scored by Kavany immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he showed himself to be much more skillful in exact passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted kick, which passed the barbell by Wieland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and it was only Wieland's close interception of the ball that prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before the substitute, Escequiel Lavessie, was not counted at the very end of the match.
Malme coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying, "Our last Champions League game was in December of last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion on stock sale
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, made $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its grand plan to reduce debt.
Quoted on the London Stock Exchange, Glencore made a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds in order to repay the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with the collapse in commodity prices while China’s economic slowdown worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a discounted price, the Glencore stock price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which traded 0.69 percent higher when it opened.
Glencore last week began selling shares worth $2.5 billion as part of extensive plans to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold the new shares at 125 cents apiece, that is, at a discount of 2.4 percent to the price at the close of trading on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company’s authorized capital.
Fears of a continued downturn in the Chinese economy led to iron ore prices falling by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States later this month.
This visit, Xi Qinping’s first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping with wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner that evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively address controversial topics,” the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle for a meeting with executives from several leading U.S. tech companies on his way to Washington and then head to New York to attend the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns over China’s alleged cyber espionage and China’s growing assertiveness over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The hit biker on the Kutuzovsky hit man received 2 years in prison.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims to Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorohomilovsky court of Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who shot down a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in prison in the colony-settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of traffic rules and operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the discussions of the parties, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoev to three years in prison and to recover from him the claims of the victims in full - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three o’clock in the morning in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW car, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the oncoming lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
From the injuries received, a man born in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and before the accident went to the oncoming lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motor rally from the Sparrow Hills to the Moscow GUMVD building on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation following the interrogation detained the alleged culprit of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man came into the temple.

More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the Presidium of the regional government.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnevadinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
Repairs will be made to hot and cold water supply networks, water disposal, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a set of measures for fire safety and energy saving will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation are told by the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shuglia, who became part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between the regions, which are important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and sectional sessions will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory support and programs of the Union State.
The forum will be addressed by the Governor of the Tyumen region.
I think that this testifies to successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
It was attended by more than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our developments is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, it was about the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
The problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house Belshina and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, since investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
It was talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of OJSC MAZ, the development of the service center of OJSC MAZ, which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC TPATP.
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the approval and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These issues were also related to the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the Tyumen city administration, Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already “breathing incense”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel, is required.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of OJSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for installing new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the groundwork, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday edition of the HBO show Project Greenlight, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Shaded Brown, not believing his ears, angrily exclaimed "Wow! Wow. Well, well" all the time, while the actor from "Martian" gave comments live.
To discuss the show's finalists, fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers joined Damon and Brown.
"I'd like participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to adhere to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film Dear White People advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio should direct the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After the discussion was televised, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video: “Explaining Matt Damon’s diversity to the only black person in the room is SO white that it hurts.”
Tweet scored more than 5000 retweets and 4000 "likes".
Damon’s remarks come at a time when media coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of candidates in the nomination “Album of the Year” at the Grammy Awards.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be seen as a group of haters.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon is on the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show “American Ninja Warrior”, taking home the prize of $ 1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, no one has yet been able to go through all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a rope 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task, becoming the first American Ninja Warrior athlete to pass the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero managed the task as much as three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the victory, which went with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was in shock at winning a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“To think about it is incredible, I have never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! such a serious jump in his income.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to walk the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
“If there are more than one finisher, the fastest player gets the prize,” said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes lives, it still gets a lot of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any resentment about it.
He is happy with what he has done.

"Baby Tigers" quietly bypass "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now rank last in the American League Central Division.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly won Tuesday from the Minnesota Twins with a total of 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to reduce the gap from the Houston Astros by half a game and take second place in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the F-word that eluded them for much of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they come out,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
This was only his third quality start in nine outs.
“I just want to finish the year with good results,” Simon said.
Pitchers on a substitute fail to drop in every game, and so I want to get deeper into the game.
Appointed Tigers batter Victor Martinez managed to bat three strokes and achieved two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since four strokes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," Osmus said.
He performed well in (batter quality), noticeably better in bat work and retained this quality for the game.
Having scored three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to return to the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left field line.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bow, took first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a strikeout on a swing from Simon before left-handed Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy overtook Moera, the only player on the way, before newly appointed batsman Miguel Sano, who kicked a two-run "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not out and a comparing wound at second base, Verhagen managed to lead third baseman Trevor Plumf to a double-play batting.
It was the 27th time for a major league lead this season that Plumf kicked the ball to double play.
After Detroit added a safety wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned RBI "double" in the space between the outfielders against closing Tigers pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player kicked Sano out after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the deserved pitcher, who was on the injured list until the game itself, missing more than a month due to lumbar inflammation.
“Definitely not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wook at two outs of raitfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with runners-up in a productive position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos then made a single, bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased their score in the second inning, receiving a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center batsman Anthony Gouse, and went 3-0.
"It was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit particularly well, but he got right to the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in a third inning that did not bring points, after which he was replaced by a right-handed reliver A. J. Akhter.
Hughes was counted three wounds for six hits and a wok with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Pitcher right-handed Tigers Anibal Sanchez dropped out of the players due to a right shoulder sprain.
It will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had Sanchez surgery on his shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to launch on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not played since August 20 due to a sprained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov’s original complaint on the book “Prayer to God” came to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court.
In the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the book “Pray to God: its significance and place in Islam” as “extremist material”, Interfax reports with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhray.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants of the process.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense,” he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material.”
From the Prosecutor’s office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk came the appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they asked the court to recognize only the opinion of the author of this book as extremist, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
The Qur’an says, “We worship You and ask You for help, so do not call on anyone besides Allah.”
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book “the devils and provocateurs.”
Deputies of the state Duma, he urged to prohibit by law court decisions relating to the texts of the scriptures.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma should adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly related to the texts of the Quran and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of Facebook intends to work together with the Ministry of justice of Germany.
So, the day before, the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry of justice together with specialists of the social network is creating a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove incorrect comments regarding migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for deleting their record.
To facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content should also organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network on offensive posts.
Facebook wants to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of justice of Germany was made after the German segment of Facebook sharply increased xenophobic sentiment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented scale of the migration crisis that engulfed the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany today all the points intended for accommodation of refugees are overcrowded.
On the eve of the country’s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be zones for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological recreation.
Among the first will be Butovo, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinsk cemetery.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troyekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru said Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budgetary institution "Ritual".
Relaxation zones will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such “corners” cemetery visitors will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, zones for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the areas of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantings will serve as a living fence that will separate recreation areas and areas allocated directly for burial sites.
The experts of GBU Ritual also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon hedges at burials.
New cemeteries can truly become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which cemetery visitors will be able to learn GPS coordinates and burial license plates.
In June this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
In the forests of Elny five days later found a lost mushroom.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
It was possible to find the mushroom-mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
His relatives, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was connected to the search work.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for asses and underbelly, but did not return by evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised to search for the fungus - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went far, far away, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the place of search.
He has traveled a great distance at his age.
Miraculously he survived.
Gribnyk was taken to the Yelnin central district hospital unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors do not represent.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Hellenic CRB: "The patient is being examined, treated."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic illnesses.
The patient’s condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich every year comes to Smolensk from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to collect mushrooms, but he never went far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle, it is not local."
I’ve been visiting for a few years, visiting relatives.
Well, I went for mushrooms.
I guess I went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind, so that you can then go back.
An emergency An-2 sat on the seething in the fraternal taiga.
Directly on the proseke sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
An emergency landing aircraft Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself sustained significant damage upon landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
On board were three crew members - commander, co-pilot and flight mechanic, reports "Interfax".
The emergency plane made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsk - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The fraternal transport Prosecutor’s office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began to check compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office left for the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
On the liner, engines and onboard electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the plane’s emergency landing.
The Nobel Prize Winner: Globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of HSE Decisions, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“And these forecasts have largely come true,” says Maskin.
China and India, for example, have experienced strong GDP growth per capita.
But not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequality, or rather, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, says Eric Maskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the HSE.
Together with the economist, Professor of Harvard University Michael Kremer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases with the growth of globalization, reminiscent of the HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four skill levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the skill level to collaborate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have higher wages thanks to cooperation with B-level workers from rich countries, then D-level workers do not feel growth or their wages are falling at all.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to the widening of the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, to increasing the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It allows us to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the HSE Department of Mathematics.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no case calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: The Living Link of Time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - in September celebrates its 2000th anniversary.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "One Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khanate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plantains, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of wildlife".
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be poured with fragrant tea and treated with Dagestani delicacies - honey figs, persimmons, mushmula, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, from time immemorial, large samovars have been used to give tea to numerous guests at one time.
An inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in the year 115 AH.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: arcades of domes and vaults rely on square columns and are illuminated by rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of domestic birds put doves in yards, under trees, in attics.
An exciting sight is the rise into the sky of a flock of white pigeons, similar to flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Leaving for 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
In one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - strips of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with a pile and without it, with complex ornamentation and a whimsical border.
The development of the city began with magals - blocks with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the magi have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lamps remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water supply system built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
To this day, ancient sources have survived, in which local residents still collect water today.
Many Derbent people prefer ordinary tap water to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Watering and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters and now make wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope, which is performed by students of the Republican School of Circus Art.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship dates back several centuries.
A new trend - among the ropewalkers more and more often you can see girls.
In the premises of the former Maiden's bath today there is a museum "Culture and life of Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here, accompanied by friends, and now anyone can see the vaulted-dome hall, hot and cold pools, bathing accessories that have gone into the past.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of warming up the body with steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Commonwealth", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnopodvory of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagus, yellowed from time, is carved from solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among Arabs, along the axis of the west-east.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been in this place for many years.
Receptions of the barber craft are passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, the house in which the exiled writer-decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, life and everyday life of citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, communicate with friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of tea.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning to perfection the folk avar, dargin, tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, local residents sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbents discuss domestic issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game at the airport".
In the capital, they are experiencing a new form of education.
Four hundred students have tried themselves in the role of airport employees.
To do this, models of three air harbors were mounted in Domodedovo.
Young people not only searched and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it is not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar Domodedova - a standard set of tasks to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar fit three major airports from around the world.
Today they employ four hundred students from metropolitan colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the air harbor.
Registration of passengers, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - they were entrusted even with buses on the flight field, ladders and passenger inspection.
Passengers are very problematic.
One had a document problem, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum period.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amount for the service of the flight.
“For failure to perform the relevant tasks, they are fined,” explains Dmitry Hilko, financial analyst of the game, in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of training.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional centers of competence will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," says Natalia Zolotarev, director of the department of state policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the grades for this exam had quite a material expression.
The latest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
“I received them for responding to a claim to our airport in Instagram in a timely manner,” said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they say, were taken on a pencil to invite to their work by the time they completed their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the U.S. Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent years call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and at other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries,” US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement to Interfax.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the educational exchange program FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to strike.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar’s desk, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
“We didn’t give you a 110-page order to make fun of him,” Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is put, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has considered more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungles to one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where infrastructure development does not keep pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas are cut down for development by new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the state for the green movement, the NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
So, in May this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “impossible”.
Sometimes court decisions are really impossible to enforce within the time limit set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
“His main goal is to shake up this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects: it has stopped the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We may close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of the judge’s pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite sharply falling popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government on incoming and outgoing vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously found out in factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to come to the attention of the courts, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principled judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, pompously announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and turns to screaming.
Do you know what the word "saint" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and in it were feces, - the judge is excited.
You keep polluting the river because you think: Ganges is Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you do with it every day.
Cleaning up the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Indians who swim in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while it takes at least eight billion to clean the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be the environment.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unacceptable luxury,” says Call Gang activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development.”
A man poured blood on several paintings of Dali at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the windows in the museum and ruined the sculpture of Salvador Dali “The Appearance of an Angel”.
Now the museum hosts an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately behaved inadequately: he ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
Then he began to move around the premises and stained with blood several works of permanent exposure.
Among them is a portrait of Poruk by Miervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobychin, to whom Interfax refers, the shop windows were also spoiled.
Police and art experts work at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been initiated against a man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists from August 4 to September 27, an exhibition of works by Picasso and Dali is held, which presents more than 200 original works of artists.

Xi Jinping calls for economy to be more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and will provide new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, changes to border controls, the encouragement of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the rule of law in the business sphere and increasing openness, according to the statement.
The government will also loosen control over the powers it gives to companies, thereby ensuring that companies do their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green card”, will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and issues of training professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
