Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about being "associated with the Muppets"
Some AAs are horrified by the recommendation to change their title to "Member of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation came about due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
And the entire political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One Labour FA said his group was concerned about the Roma with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "underthinking", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The CHA from the Welsh Party said that his group as a whole is "not satisfied" and offers alternatives.
One Welsh conservative said his group was "impartial" about the name change, but drew attention to the fact that the MWP could quickly become a "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation of "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the Assembly members will certainly be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly into the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
As for how to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them “members of the Welsh Parliament”, i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CAs offer alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could cause problems for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a change bill within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the suspension of the CA and the structure of the system of committees.
They will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized in order to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times
“The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church here at every corner,” Adams says.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People today are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the kind of local welcome they regularly go to."
As for churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominium houses, and there would be people living there who would not help the shrines remaining nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Maarten ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community moved out of here in the 1930s.
The black community, which conducted ceremonies nearby, received ownership of the building.
St. Maarten moved to a black community led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to rebuild it and installed a carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical tool.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he was not replaced in Saint-Martin.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been attracted by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The council — the parish's governing body, which consists of lay leaders — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would "attempt to pass on costs" to the council while the council did not take part in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who dived after lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at nearly 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and he and a group sailed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a delight about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting: "I was bitten!
They tasted me!”
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Rada in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto beach in Casablada to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetic islands similar to those in department stores. Skilled sellers will be able to work on the islands.
As part of the increased entry into the British market of cosmetics worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is declining), the enlarged islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the hollow space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be branded zones similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the range of Boutique cosmetics: now most of the presented products will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl's discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's opens Argos branches in hundreds of its stores, and a number of Habitats departments are also open. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased food sales, and also made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split revenues from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for ?125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help those adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s chief commercial officer, said: “We’ve changed the look of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for shoppers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that now we are an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition to the old way of buying. ”
Peter Jones ‘frustrated’ after Holly Willoughby walked out of ?11 million deal
Lion of the Dragon star Peter Jones is furious that TV host Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is 11 million pounds) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was linked to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Peltrow.
37-year-old presenter of the program This Morning announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought Dragon League star Peter Jones to the fore when she exited their lucrative life goods business at the last minute to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "crazy" when a golden girl from TV admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new deal worth 1.5 million pounds means she no longer has enough time to devote to their shared brand of home clothes and accessories.
This business was linked to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Peltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
The source reported, "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It was to be its long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby's decision to go out of business stunned all the parties' interests.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
The headquarters in Marlowe is full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had three children who were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp formed Truly in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin's firm, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his affairs."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for comments that some would consider “non-presidential,” as well as a very positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news anchor.
I didn’t do anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “responsible response” from the US to its first steps on disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this packed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was affected, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel will be able to work locally.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters have been built, but they are not typical for other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was active, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship, which was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Palu, but will be able to get to the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding shortfall has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to re-elect next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by continued interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have opted for a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as a result of the confrontation between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League with his goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal. At this point, his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball to his left leg and charged it in the direction of the far rod.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the top right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Kepa Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take the position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go on the attack as much as possible, so I just tried to provide myself with as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and made one touch, I didn't think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker passed the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, turned near the middle of the field and quickly ran to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly played in the wall in the middle of the field.
He went on to make a fine penetrating pass, which led Azar to the penalty.
Hazard overtook the defense and made a decisive kick with his left foot in the grid of the distant rod. The ball passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Sao Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was littered with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Muse, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called to respond to people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented, "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I am asking anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have filmed something on a video recorder, to contact us as the information in these videos can be very important to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are now informing the victim's next of kin.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood behind the fence, and another van stood in front of the fence.
Several police officers stood behind the fence and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to write a direct message to ?MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 and name the code 247 and the date of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved retribution for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said, "Given the current debate about removing the statues, it was inevitable that a statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his order.
Cromwell is likely to be unjustly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell by sculptor William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the figure's historiography, which many believe is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, probably more so at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell to be a protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and honoring."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead in blood with a torn artery near a pigsty in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is going to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty.
He is reported to have left with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the pigsty door was open.
The brother noted that there was a large boar in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a 249-pound boar had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were in blood and distorted," said the victim's cousin with the surname Wu, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that when police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that seven Yuan Ya and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, but cases of swine attacks on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted critical injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed against a tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a "trigger."
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive downpours to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to weaken as it moved over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains with floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a vein that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the Peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity to the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain to parts of Mexico.
Further in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching reservoir, will create strong showers in the southwest.
In this area, 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous rain floods, garbage streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in rainfall in places up to 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 x 10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical showers are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring gusty winds and dust storms here.
The approach of the log will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause small streams of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first storm in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will come over the Fore Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a large area of the center and east of the United States will be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding the average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the case of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the eye-catching testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
The political standoff continued, with the channels interrupting planned programs to report the latest Friday news: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had hit her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to research company Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to obtain figures from other networks that also featured hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience watching a playoff match or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts of the opinion show strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was a leader among all channels during the hearing, which lasted all day, with an average viewership of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became a central figure in Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to go on the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes, during which he was barking, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had released a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for a full Senate vote.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority demands.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons, and then with several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, as it was obvious that Republicans would have no votes to nominate Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came alongside Theresa's front-page interview, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Checkers Brexit plan, saying it was "absolutely absurd" to propose that Britain and the EU levy tariffs on each other.
Who shot Wade Sims: Police arrest Daytona Simpson on suspicion of death of Louisiana State University player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, police removed the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them.
When questioned by Simpson, police reported that he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Escape Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Louisiana State University sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for "ageing and pursuing justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what bothers you all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws ash at Mexico City
Ashes that eject the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, because the crater began activity and was recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and tremors.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Khochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located at a distance of 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
The pro-separatist masked group, which was restrained by special agents, threw eggs and powder paint at them, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Clashes took place later that day, with police using sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independence supporters who chanted "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" clashed with supporters of the country's preservation who shouted, "Long live Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen people were assisted in light injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high.
Voters mostly voted for independence, but turnout was low, as the majority of those against secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but had to go another route.
Narcis Termez, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy that they can vote, but now we have gone into a dead end,” he said.
Despite a vital but very difficult victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have failed to maintain momentum this year as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment pending trial for their participation in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we are seeing from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from a crossbow.
Menga's kick secured Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga in the “Livingstone” became the winner
Elevated in the Livingston class, he stunned Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second 18-game defeat as the club's Ibrox manager.
Dolly Menga's kick was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose one level from Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team has not won any Premier League appearances this season and will play next Sunday with the Harts leaders, from whom it is eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue their undefeated move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has yet to be defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the chances given to non-hosts.
Holt's team was supposed to be in front long before they scored, because their directness creates all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Lithgow punched past the gate after squeezing and taking a hit by Craig Halkett along the gate that he had made with his head.
The hosts were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard regulations.
And so a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and scored from the penalty center.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but the defense of the owners of the field turned out to be impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did manage to strike towards Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick kicked Rangers goalie Allan McGregor. Lithgow hit past the gate in another standard Livingstone combination.
The canopies constantly flew into the penalty "Livingstone" and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for a penalty - after the attack of Halkett on Glenn Middleton, who came on as a substitute, and for the game of the hand - were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingstone": analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All played well to one, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much since returning to the top level, but Holt should be given credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandly, very well organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard, but now fall far short of those standards.
They lacked the last ball — only once they broke through the defenses of the owners of the field — and it was something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received ambiguously in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and a blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Some disputes have arisen between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests attest to the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
The cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area of the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from an accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the man to inform his next of kin.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes are changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Jailers Injured in Riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of riots in a men's maximum security prison, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began at approximately 9:30 a.m. British Standard Time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the unrest, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special Tornado unit was called in.
Officers were given medical care due to light facial injuries received at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to address the ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical attention due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and their prison terms can be extended."
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, among them the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent for inpatient treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious unrest, during which prison inmates were attacked with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (dried areas may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but that’s what could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa head through the southwest desert, creating the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona, it is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, in places up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of torrential flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these showers are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to landslides on the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
Rose, still in the force of the hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall from Baja California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, in places possibly up to 25.4 cm," reports weather.com.
Rose would go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get to the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that would go on through Arizona and get to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main danger that is expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and in the southwest of the American desert,” the National Hurricane Center reports.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening storm floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer-Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at about 04:00 British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking anyone who can have any video of these events on their phone to respond.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blazey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president rancidly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to “oppose and prevent.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many washed into the ocean, when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country's authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the dusk broke on the shore, knocking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 points.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately start running away and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that, before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Pushes in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s strong earthquake was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic location, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the tsunami's strength, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "widespread" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
"The lines of communication have been completely damaged and we have not received any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers have left for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that a tsunami hit Pal, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a house shouting frantic warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water slammed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
Troops have begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The airport has been opened for assistance only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
The staff of the World Vision organization from Donggali safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
That's very bad.
Even as relief groups began to take decisive action to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.”
Already the second night fell on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman lying under stones for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an older paraglider, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon recounts how hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray checker, not double blue checkers.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took 26 750 dollars during the replenishment of the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was running an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department news report.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy, another man "run back to a Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended to be replenished.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the news, but police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to YE
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to YE.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, "Formerly officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been called Ye for some time, and he used that acronym as the title for his album, released in June.
The change came on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation due to "emotional reasons," the author of the show said.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name, West used to say that this word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'is' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Fight.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” has been abbreviated to simply YE — it’s just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use an army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China ramps up AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, said Kai-Fu Li, an AI investor and practitioner who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the US increase its efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to candidates of science in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work in China lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry partners and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it now invests more than $ 100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has taken no steps for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would reach the minimum 50% that would allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum ballot reads: “Do you support NATO and EU membership subject to the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not carry legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two-thirds of the votes in parliament will be required.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast ballots in the ballot box.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter Goze Tanevsky in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name, paving the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, and not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example, to China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote in favor, since more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result “yes” will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote for it.
In order for a referendum to be declared valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The referendum defeat will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it began operations last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and found himself in an open field.
Next, Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then overtook several more on the edge of the Brighton penalty.
He then made a pass to the left when he saw Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, launched it to the right of the gate, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blues in this Premier League match was provided by Sterling.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along Leroy Sane's left flank.
Leroy made a few touchdowns and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the long bar.
The sky-blue forward threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped out of bounds.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take points in the "Rockys"
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of the playoffs, there was no significant reason to wait for another start.
But rival Scherzer hopes to hit the pitch on Sunday in a game against the Colorado Rockies on the condition that the Rockies still have difficulty reaching the playoffs. Now the Rockies are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies at least have a wildcard for a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek to secure a first division title.
“Despite the fact that we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to leave the ball, knowing how the audience behaves here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I have seen this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this contest?
The Nationals will yet announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards being Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usually weekend.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 score with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president briefly mentioned the situation around his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m everywhere I can, fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using any means, you see meanness, scum.
They don’t care who suffers from them, because of whom you need to step over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we are not going to give them.
The Democrats’ mission, he said, is “to oppose and obstruct.”
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "evil and mean, vile and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked an audience to loud outcries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting — it was really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was hardly a surprise.
In the end, I am the last Labour member of Parliament to be informed that they are not welcome, and all this because we express our opinion.
My Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in much the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
A statement from Labour's Nottingham East meeting on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began to be implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not allow for different views and each opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I previously seemed to have similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by a tirade of attacks on social media calling for a recall, condemning the center’s policies, I’m told I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments sent to me are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with each "distrust" movement or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to move, not to speak so loudly that I was “all right”.
But that’s not why I got into politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy because, due to the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my high school class was literally falling apart, and since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them the most, whether it's a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one at Nottingham East was disturbed by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in an environment where the country is moving towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, both members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to withdraw me and no political gain will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": undefeated "Air" climb up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in today's wonderful Scottish Premiership entertainment match.
Now they lead the table, this is the only undefeated team out of ten.
After all, excellent defense and an improved ability to take advantage of the odds gives hosts and coach Peter Murchi full right to be satisfied.
"So far we've been tested by our games and we're still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I give credit to Air, they used the odds better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, implemented by Frazier Climo, took Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes issued by the Verriors allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used the unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of Air with a penalty and just before the break he made and realized a solo attempt, which gave the score 17-5 in favor of Air
But the Melroses started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a continued delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried out of the field on a stretcher, and from the restart Air broke out ahead with Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Climo.
Air captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again, Melrose forced another player to pay off Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under heavy pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the mole of Air.
Climo implemented a try, which he did almost every time after restarting, after which Kyle Rowe received a hit in the box from David Armstrong and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth try of the hosts team.
It seems that the star of the series “Still the game” is set for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the star of the series “Still a game” Ford Kieran is set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
“Our sea”: Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the fleet's equipped headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get him back.”
Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, still has the memory of the loss of the coastline that went to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, as well as the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, it expects a positive result,” commented Roberto Calzadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICJ decision on big screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will force into negotiations to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, then little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case was “not difficult,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could contribute to the rollback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' militant rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of differences by getting mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America's most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This ruling is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which stalled more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ree says the belief that continuing sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration of an end to the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees is an “unfulfilled dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country probably believes is the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headgear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversize hats from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide feather-decorated fields, which covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones of watermelon, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not in order to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks - very timely in front of Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled equipment for scuba diving with a tube and glasses, the other looked like an ice cream cone that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to "La Bombi", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen at all: from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the very impractical hat, which could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in the swimsuit that carried it.
The yellow-red raffia bag with raffia fringe and white leather handle was a central element of the La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection of the Jacquemus brand at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent exam results, which are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which have over 30,000 students across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCSE). They aim to provide the best level of services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, they perceive it with their mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she takes it with her heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest exam results this year, we can see that independent language schools are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
Data collected from 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of students received a higher A score from Chinese, and a further 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French, and 63% of those learning Spanish also received an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), within independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers can’t close vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary in preparing young people for future careers.
As more and more promising positions require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because this is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with a greater chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK from a 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed no matter what the future holds for them.
Now it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers have almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers' preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he replied.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today begins a series of pre-election rallies from Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the nomination he has proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to form support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s West Virginia evening rally take place and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in the West Virginia city of Wheeling is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump will likely recall the tense hearings this week over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November election.
Representatives for President Trump said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The planned at the stadium “Vesbanko Arena” in the city of Willing today’s rally can come supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in the past month to West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is lagging behind on the results of polls.
"It's not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his ranking in polls," Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is set to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday's singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the afternoon Saturday forsmos may be exactly what this Ryder Cup was missing.
A cunning impulse pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when do they say the impulse is working?
"They were six points ahead and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little bit as an impulse," Jordan Spit said as he walked away.
Europe has an advantage, of course, by four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, Spit says, feel a bit of wind in their sails, as well as a lot of encouragement, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
The sweat with his murderous blows from ty-maidan to grin shows an example.
These laryngeal cries of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patch and equalized the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His putt, which allowed them to win a 15-hole match, was met with a similar cry, one that tells you the American team doesn't give up.
"You really just have to try really hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual, but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who didn't do a boggy on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid boggy on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and back makes us believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe foreballs and foresights closely through the interaction between the participants of the pair, through the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and it is also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of foresight also showed that the US team intends to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's foreballs and forks, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over trailing Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning foreballs with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the Forsomas and won two matches, but failed to close the gap.
Team Jim Furik needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (together "Mollywood") after a sensational weekend are only the second couple to score four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreballs, they teamed up to defeat blown Woods and rookie American Bryson Deschambo with an even more spectacular 5th-4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed occasional outbursts of genius, but so far he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fouls and forsoms and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning foreballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foresights to get a 2-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world rankings.
Europe could not do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three times the main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They received a decisive 2-1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the foreballs and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy by a score of 4-1 in the foresights, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team come back with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furik's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their power.
North Korea says ‘no way’ to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens mistrust in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea took “substantial measures of good will” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And while Ri echoed North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for taking incremental steps, his statement proved important in that it did not reject Pyongyang’s unilateral denuclearization in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on "denuclearizing the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. is pushing for ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even objecting to ‘declaring an end to the war,’” he said.
“To believe that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, and not the United States, were a party to this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Rea's speech was sharply different from last year's when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles at the U.S. mainland was imminent after "Mr. Wicked President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" who wants to commit suicide.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he does not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months - it does not matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and steadily until we see a full, final, confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Kim said he needed “appropriate measures” to ensure the security that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year has provided all its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning coolness all night after refilling with caffeine.
The teacher found that the world’s number one university students are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed what he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, one girl came up to him and said, “Why am I being told this now, at the last course?”
“She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” the teacher shared with The Telegraph.
At the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously sleep-deprived within a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room in the dormitory where students click cups of coffee, curtains, exercise equipment, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of cigarette smoking,” added Professor Chaisler.
A culture of “wake up all night” pride still exists, he added, as well as noting that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to undergo a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chasler recommends students to put a reminder that you should go to bed, as well as put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light”, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers experienced another attack of away sadness: Dolly Menga's kick brought Steven Gerrard's distinguished team a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox team sought to win their first away game victory after a February triumph over St Johnston by a score of 4–1, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard as manager from 18 games. Gerrard's team remained eight points behind leaders of the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers lineup, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could even out the score.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth position, and Livingston have risen to third, and only Hibernian is ahead of them by the difference of the balls.
In addition, "Rangers" can cause another trouble, because the lineman Calum Spence was forced to treat a head wound after he was thrown from the guest sector by some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once swept past Air into the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same Lions 11 line-up that took one point to the Harts last week, and was thrilled by how his forced-out guys squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston worked more with the resulting ball.
They were to score just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Deep free kick Keagan Jacobs got skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the back bar
The Rangers did get control, but there was more hope in the last third than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should be eligible for a penalty at the mark of a quarter of an hour after colliding with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali's head and Ovie Ejaria's calm kick hardly bothered.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute goal may have been against the game, no one can deny that they only deserved it with their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs's procurement.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coolibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the winger made his way to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they like when Lithgow and Halkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could improve on the final stages, but McGregor was good at confronting Jacobs before Lithgow hit out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late penalty bid when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac “Sunday morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time goes... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, counting Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film “Coronado Bells” with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboy scientists.
Man: "What is it at all?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter that's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Well, well, it's really cracking right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which is part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" the protein, which is common to many types of cancer. Next, these cells re-introduce the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer (HER2), and then reintroducing these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 'stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in a MAGA baseball cap, Kanye West knocked out with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience
Viewers in the studio of the show SNL (Saturday evening live) booed Kanye after his sad performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called "Ghost Town" in a baseball cap labeled "Return America to Former Glory," it exploded with a tirade in which it criticized Democrats and reiterated its support for Trump.
“Often during the conversation, white people ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, which he gave before the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case of Christine Blaze Ford's lawsuit about violent acts of a sexual nature.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tirade was posted on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had an unpleasant situation because of the main outfit.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West said: “When I was behind the scenes, I was rude.
I was told, "Don't go out to the audience in that baseball cap."
They bullied me!
And then I'm told I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll put on my Superman baseball cap because no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction from the audience in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show looked confused. One of the viewers said: "In the studio, a dead silence prevailed."
Vesta was asked at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It" in a Perrier water bottle costume.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST NATO.”
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West "is who he is, and it's just wonderful."
"But I will NOT reward him (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, professes and rejects an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
“Like me,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one who was previously known as Kanye Vesta."
West is not the first artist to change his name. He follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, a fellow rapper, used to be called Snoop Lyon, and as you know, the musical legend of the last decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became the "Artist formerly known as Prince".

Game of Thrones star Keith Gerington condemns idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones” produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor of performances condemning the stereotype of the hero-macho, arguing that because of such heroes on the screens, young guys often think that they should become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith stated that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of the popularity of the hashtag .
Keith, who recently married his fellow “Game of Thrones” actress Rose Leslie, 31, said he was “quite determined” to tackle the issue.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. When did we start on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"What do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the lens of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through the portrayal of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, “What is natural, and what do we plant?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think the really important question today is, “How do we change this?”
It’s obvious that the young guys have lost the right way.”
In the interview, he also noted that he would not be filming any prequels and sequels to “Game of Thrones” after the end of the show next summer, because “already finished with the battles and horses.”
From November, Keith will play in the production of the play “The Real West” by Sam Shepard - the story of the film producer and his brother-the robber.
As an actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best that he received from participating in the series “Game of Thrones”.
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life,” said Keith.
In the fantasy series, which received the Emmy awards, Rose played Ygritte - the love of Gerington's hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says 14% increase in new cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
According to representatives of health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to health officials during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Decriminalization of homosexuality in China occurred in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, seeing this as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senators' data to the network by her full-time employee and sharply criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters condemned allegations that one of her staffers posted the personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
L.A. Democrat claims that these statements are spread by “ultra-right” political observers and websites.
“Lying, lying, and then more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate Commission on charges of unlawful sexual acts brought against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data breach occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak was associated with the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its staff member.
“These baseless statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office, whose personal data and security are compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, among others, said former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is filled with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, you do not need to be angry.
The accused should not behave presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and undisturbed.”
Fleischer appeared to draw parallels between Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“That’s news if it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already notified "relevant state and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
“We will do everything possible to find those responsible,” she continued, “and they have been held accountable before the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: The New Mission" - a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for meaning in every new British film inspired by Brexit. There are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies for action films about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released in 2003, later the series was renewed in 2011, filming "Johnny English: Relaunch".
Will the mockingly ironic self-satisfaction about what we are unfavorably become the nation's new export potential?
Anyway, Johnny English with his moving face and pampered eyes for the second time got the opportunity to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a recklessly funny secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean and much more - from the guy who played one note of the melody from the movie "Fire chariots" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character’s prototype is also a traveler and an international mystery that has always left behind a mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are some good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter in his knighthood and the propeller blades were chatting about his helmet.
The film well reveals Atkinson’s talent to arrange a buffonade, but the humor is passable, and in some moments it is too much, especially when compared with “serious” film brands, such as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible”, one of the “influencers” of which is also a comedy.
It seems that the jokes are calculated more on children than on adults, and to me the senseless misfortunes that happen to Johnny English do not seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's wits in silent films about Bean.
As always, the film begins with the fact that the UK is facing a serious threat.
A hacker infiltrates the British super-secret spy network and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last straw for the Prime Minister - a haughty person who has already undergone crushing criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script did not allow him to fully disclose it).
Intelligence advisors have informed her that all active agents have been compromised and she needs to bring in someone retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some super-fashionable institution and unofficially teaches children undercover work (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers there were several successful jokes).
Inglisha is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he meets again with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of the exalted annoying person does not quite correspond to the talent of Vicky Pepperdine).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service is gone, Batman and Robin return to the ranks and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, played by Olga Kurylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire, who earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network, the dashing Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous pranks: dressed as waiters, they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on a luxury yacht Volta; English arranges a real mess when he tries to use the helmet of virtual reality.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his good-naturedness and frenzy, he somewhat resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with other Johnny English films, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?
Labour denies preparing a plan to allow Britons to work four days a week but get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to discuss a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but get paid five days a week.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige company managers to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time will bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and will direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from changes in the general economic situation.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
Labour was not the first to approve of the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The party's political agenda does not envisage the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea now."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party's election congress last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless directors” of utility companies and “whistleblowers.”
The shadow chancellor’s plan also means that water company shareholders may not get their full share of capital if the Labour government imposes a “deduction” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the board of companies and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers who expect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Gray and John Kennedy tell the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes) whether the investigation of Kavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, can change their opinion.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge is postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh after the publication of the results of the investigation of the bureau.
In the Sunday show 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I told him that I had had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and that accusation came out, asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was resolute, unshakable, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that bringing Kavanaugh charges is a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” added Graham, addressing Christine Blaze Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with a stunning number of star performers and an equally remarkable mission to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be huddled in the Great Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the festival’s true purpose: to tackle extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a series of tasks or "acts" such as taking a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding the act a free concert a genius way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel like they're really changing something by signing an e-petition or making a post on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving various goals.
The organization claims that these actions prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $ 37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as examples of its performance, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial commitments, we can mention the Fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. In the framework of the project, investors and implementers have committed to “help children grow up” and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages on Twitter from the organization Citi.
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 “acts” calling for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government has announced funds for The Power of Nutrition project, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme level of poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: “This is a long and difficult road, so sometimes we fall and we’ll fail.
However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements here, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gianelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s festival in New York, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of internal Affairs said that the United States can use naval forces to “blockade” to prevent the export of Russian energy resources
According to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary,” Washington can seek the help of the naval forces to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including the markets of the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
“Thanks to the naval forces, the United States can provide free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Consumer Energy Alliance), a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy resources efficiently and replace them with alternative ones,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy resources of mineral origin.
While these statements were made, the Trump administration set a goal to increase exports of compressed natural gas to Europe, displacing from the energy market of Russian origin, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, officials of the Trump administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “inappropriate” project of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, which costs $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is vehemently opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federal Association of German Industry, said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think” about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
According to The Hill, Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that, he should be headed by a woman.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider putting forward my candidacy for the presidency.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of Donald Trump's presidency, saying that he "leads his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken, criticizing Trump and his proposed Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "...no doubt, the FBI should conduct an investigation before the vote."
However, according to a poll released on Friday, a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Suffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts opposed the nomination of the senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick enjoys more support. For his potential nomination for the presidency, 38% spoke against - 48%.
During discussions of the candidacy of other prominent Democrats who may run in 2020, also called the former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Palin recalls PTSD Track Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after he returns, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming home not the way they used to be, more violent, and want to know if they respect here what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other servicemen have made for this country."
According to the Vasilla City Police Department spokesman, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, as well as obstructing reporting of an incident of violence and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the U.S.'s new policy of denying refugee status to victims of gang harassment and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to the court consultant in Washington to support the plaintiff, who needs asylum and appealed the policy in court.
The plaintiff’s full name in Grace v. Sessions, a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Union challenging federal policy and filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his violent bandit sons" beat her, but U.S. officials denied her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General General Carl Reisin said in a speech Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” the court’s consultant’s analytical note reads.
Prosecutors further argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the U.S. harm the country’s economy because they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “replenish the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to immigration judges in June saying they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Sessions said in a June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even those serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those who survived, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled
For those who are still alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, repossessing flooded belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged in the earthquake, the strength of which was 7.5 on the Richter scale, overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the army hospital Pal, where patients are provided with assistance under the open sky due to constant repeated shocks.
His eyes filled with tears when he recalled how a strong jolt shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I’m stuck in the rubble of the wall,” Geris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife beg for help, and then silence reigned.
I don’t know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Psychological Pressure' Through 'Advertisements Containing Propaganda'
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper placed four pages of advertising material on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid application of the publication China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the congressional elections, which will be held on November 6. China rejects these accusations.
According to officials in the United States, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the American elections, mean a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose goal is pressure on China.
While foreign governments may advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington have temporarily escalated a trade war in which they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive duties in China was intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China has hurt American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Brensted wrote in a column on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is increasing pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press."
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people’s tradition of free speech and press independence to place a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
"In contrast, on the street charts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissent. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which is a concern, from which it can be concluded that the Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that “one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish” his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh Republicans set up against themselves women voters before the midterm elections
As many prominent Republicans back and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he was indicted on several sexual harassment charges, analysts warn that this could trigger an unwelcome reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, especially for women.
There is passion around this situation, and most Republicans publicly say they would like to go to the polls.
Such things then can not just play back,” said during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Rieger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which at the last minute began to insist Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona), will be enough to calm angry voters.
As reported by Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget about it tomorrow or in November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning protesters sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to proceed to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political columnist, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
“They say it’s happening now, and it’s true.
However, motivation can increase, especially among women voters aged 18-29 from the suburbs, who have not yet decided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the allegations of a Supreme Court judge in a sexual offense, analysts predicted a negative reaction from voters if Republicans insisted on approval.
As NBC News reported earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election campaign to the Democrats), Guy Cecil, noted in an interview with the news channel, “it’s not a matter of voting the committee, the final vote or that Cavanaugh was on the bench of defendants, but how they reacted to this situation and how they acted next.”
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, are divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false testimony, while Ford said the same 30% of respondents.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s insistence, the FBI is conducting a review of the charges brought by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez said that a Supreme Court judge candidate showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet plans to launch a “new Internet” to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is developing an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data repository" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current cases, calendar, audio library and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data warehouse is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “an extension of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own stand-alone applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models are undergoing fundamental changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebrations on the occasion of the presentation of the Order of the Victoria Cross to the representative of the church during the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Victoria Cross for participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the attack near Belanglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper bullet four days later and never found out that he received the highest military award of Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it “extremely symbolic” that the discovery of the memorial stone occurred exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann moved his battalion across the St. Caten Canal "through very thick fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and with "desperate courage" led the line ahead, before this one broke through to the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather had done something he himself would never have been able to repeat and deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud to be taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, and instead they were shown the Peppa Pig
Imagine that you do not sleep all night just to watch the eventful Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
In the posters of the tournament, which was held in San Jose, 13 fights were indicated, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Geghard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet in a duel, viewers in the UK froze in amazement when Peppa appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some viewers were not thrilled with this, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for the fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of unsuccessful joke."
“According to the government’s ruling, the content that was broadcast at 6am was inappropriate, so they had to start a children’s show,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations, said when asked about the show.
"Pepp's Pig, yeah".
President of Bellator Scott Cocker promised to work on the schedule of broadcasts in order to cover viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about rebroadcasting, then we can arrange it,” said Coker.
“But now there is Sunday, 6 am, and we will not be able to do anything until Sunday comes in us, and Monday in them.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages to which we responded, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that this was a discrepancy with government regulations.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal for the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he had spoken out about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that because of his fatherhood, he became less worried about winning the Olympic Games.
The presenter, who has been leading this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
Coming as a couple to Laverne's first program, Daley stated that he felt "worse" than others as a child because "society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the inspiration and strength to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was “worth it”, so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a well-known champion of the LBGT community’s rights and has taken advantage of an appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that the feeling for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daley made it to the Oscars, 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it’s hard to find someone of his age who would also have experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daly, his “world view” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have thought only that I should get gold,” he said.
“You know, there are things much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the thought of the end and before his death asked if they bought tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be in the front row because you’re not going to be around anymore,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that’s what I’d dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song - Proud performed by Heather Small - which resonated with him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 am English summer time.
On Saturday from the match of the tournament for the “Rider Cup” took out Mickelson, who was not in shape.
American Phil Mickelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Ryder Cup, but he has to regain shape so that this event does not become unhappy for him.
Mickelson, who for the record 12th time takes part in the tournament, which takes place every two years, was taken out of the game by captain Jim Furik for the time of the foreballs and foreskins.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained in the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Because Mickelson wasn't famous for punching even while at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old wasn't exactly fit for the challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the raff usually penalizes stray punches.
And if the field itself is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open championship and the master of the exact blow Francesco Molinari, who paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If Americans who are three points behind after 12 singles start well, Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this, he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He doesn’t doubt his power.
Mickelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I expected more matches, but it turned out so we decided to act like that.
He wants to be there, on the field, like anyone else.”
If Mickelson enters the field on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
On this, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furik said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, witty, witty, likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s cool to have on the team,” Furik explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time riding him and also this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big gap solves nothing
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before single matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not guarantee victory.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in a match on the field of the club Valderrama, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight margin with a score of 141-2: 131-2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the field of Valderrami; a big gap in Brookline, where we lost, and in the field of Valderrami, where we hardly won," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 Class of the winning games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the gap is 10.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum efficiency.
Go out on the field and do whatever is necessary.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to get this trophy, and that’s what we’re aiming for.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who is against us - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow could be different.
We have individual matches tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with a partner when things are going well, but it’s when you stand there alone and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the edge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of.
Unlike Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Prior to Furik, fate on the last day was returned by various parties: he was among the winners in Brookline, but was defeated when the team from Europe created “Miracle in Medina”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow. But we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put the players in the squad in the right way, like we’re going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the counteroffensive in the top match against Rory McIlroy. Next, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter were in the first half of the European team list.
“It is these partners and in this order that I chose because I want to distribute efforts evenly throughout the game,” Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed again.
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into operation in 2014 instead of outdated combat vessels during the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and a rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Rhineland-Palatinate", the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-Wurttemberg", was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This vessel was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wurttemberg class, which the naval department ordered in 2007, are to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical support. It is expected that the new frigates will be able not to return to the port of basing for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to the constant delays, ultra-modern warships, which were supposed to increase Germany's military power at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into action and returned it to Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first return of a warship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects" due to which the warship became unsuitable for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are especially important, since the crew of the Baden-Wurttemberg class ship consists of about 120 sailors - this is only half of the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel has a significant excess weight, which worsens its operational characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, the Bundestag’s Armed Services Commissioner, Hans-Peter Bartels, said the country’s navy “remained few ships fit for combat missions.”
The official said the situation had deteriorated rapidly over time as old vessels were decommissioned and new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class were able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will monitor the secret life of bats
The new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in the future to take measures to preserve them.
In the gardens of Inverview in Wester Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe species such as the netopyr dwarf and netopyr pygmy, as well as common ears and water nocturnal.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the land to monitor bat behavior during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and ownership of bat screams.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of animal habitat and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals with their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes the findings will help determine which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (e.g., the formation of grasslands) and determine the best methods of forest conservation for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the UK.
They are threatened by active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
They are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears are more effective in helping them catch prey than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct surveys, nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the estate of Trive in the area of Dumfries and Galloway. It found refuge in eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland.
Site manager David Thompson claims this is the perfect place for them.
“There are excellent conditions for bats on the territory of the estate,” he assures.
“There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research that we conduct here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before any technical work, since due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the removal of young can kill up to 400 females with young, which is likely to lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Sledgehammers and their nests are protected by law. The animal is forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats. We still haven't uncovered the characteristic features of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "defamatory" and said people were "trying to get attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
American Catherine Mayorga accused the forward of the national team of Portugal and the football club “Juventus” in the rape, which occurred in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the relevant messages “defamatory”.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are slanderous,” the five-time owner of the Golden Ball made a statement on camera.
“They want to get their attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to make money on me, but such situations are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” added the football player, smiling.
According to Reuters news agency, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called an “unacceptable message of suspicion in the field of private life.”
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most flagrant cases of violation of personal rights in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the room of the Palms Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after the meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal. Such testimony was transferred to the Clark County District Court (Nevada).
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees before her and said that he was “99 percent good guy”, who was “one percent”.
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police, and then to the hospital, where she received injuries photographed. However, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she was “afraid of revenge” and was wary of “public humiliation”.
Now the 34-year-old woman is seeking to overturn the preliminary agreement as she continues to suffer over the incident she said took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United FC. This summer, he became a player of the Italian football grand, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will ‘long regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK will "long regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of automotive production after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was encouraged by the statement of representatives of Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal, the company will be forced to suspend the production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, last year produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal for international trade.
For example, BMW said that the plant for the production of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line operates in the mode of prompt delivery of parts and materials in accordance with the needs - the parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions in the supply of parts at the border, which will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the warehouse Toyota can be placed parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that the organization's plan for relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately provides for schemes to avoid problems at the border."
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my opinion, will not only allow us to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota, as well as other automakers, we need to keep the established high-performance supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how production will be stopped for a long time, but in the long term it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Tsuwalaris, chairman of the organizing committee of the Unite trade union at the Bernaston plant, who worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants are extremely concerned: "I can say from experience that reduced jobs are not being restored."
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan to shape our future relationship with the EU.”
The meeting of trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, noted in the White house
White House officials said Sunday that a responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as discussions continue over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination for a Supreme Court judge.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For months, Washington has been debating the possibility of firing the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the powers of the President under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence in time with a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was supposed to testify to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh that further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect that it will be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held a media briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the infrequent briefing was not due to the dislike of "public game" on the part of television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing to the public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president to him,” she said, adding, without referring to the source, “Statistics speaks for itself.”
Sanders noted that the briefings will still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States, it is better than talking to me.”
We try to communicate often with the press. This should be especially noticeable over the past few weeks. The opportunity to talk with the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences attended by high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, treating journalists savvy and sometimes bizarre.
The Secretary of State for Health of Scotland addressed in a letter to employees from the EU in connection with concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed in a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work in the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman noted: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal. This autumn, we should wait for appropriate decisions.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We want you to stay.”
Christiane Ebercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christiane Ebercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by the journalist of the edition Tennessee.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came up to the sideline where he felt bad," Reed said.
Behind the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before carrying him away for further examination.
An official from the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence yet of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a freshman, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before dropping out of the game. Thus, he had 18 interceptions in a season.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty in the case of buying real estate in the UK. Under the new Tory plans, additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts of Corbyn to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying property in the UK will pay more duties. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paying workers.
The increase in duties will apply to individuals and legal entities that do not pay taxes in the UK. The government will direct additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of two years ago for a second home and real estate intended for lease, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional 120 million pounds a year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate being built in London falls into the ownership of foreign citizens. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are empty, since a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower state tariffs to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying up land without further use. He called on Theresa May to abandon quotas for affordable real estate to correct the "disgraceful situation in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important reforms in the real estate sector, in particular, the control of rent and the impossibility of eviction without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: "Last year I promised that I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - for every new generation, life must be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air is still very painful."
Jack Ross: “I want to be the head coach of Scotland”
The head coach of FC Sunderland, Jack Ross, claims that “above all things” to someday lead the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman decided to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to FC St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second national team of Scotland, but it’s over,” said Ross during the program Sportsound on BBC Scotland radio.
“When I was little, my father and I often watched the game of the national team of Scotland at the stadium “Hampden Park”. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the head coach of the club.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland FC included Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel the excitement of moving to a big club in the wake of such authoritative names, having previously rejected offers from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I will consider that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and logistical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task, but the other result I'm unlikely to consider successful for myself."
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Prior to that, he worked as a second coach at Dumbarton FC, and also spent 15 months in the coaching staff of Harts FC.
He then helped Alloa recover after FC reached the third division, and the following season with St Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the first division title.
According to Ross, he is now more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was at a crossroads,” he recalls, talking about the transition to FC Alloa.
“I really believed that coaching was more suited to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, well earned and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that have to be overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but in the role of head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching. I have never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life, as after choosing this profession. "

Study: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for a cup of beer
Summer heat helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are experiencing not the best of times, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
Calculations author Peter Martin from CGA, a consultancy on business development, said: “Thanks to the sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, July has passed the same pattern as the previous month, when pub revenue grew by 2.8%. And things went even worse from restaurants.
The June fall of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars, focused on the supply of drinks, so far have the best performance - the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs that serve food have also been affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages for the month increased by 6.6%. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%. "
Paul Newman, RSM’s hospitality and licensing analyst, said: “We have seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual fall in sales by 4.8% is of particular concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
A long hot summer is not the best time for establishments serving food. We will see if the moderate temperature we observed in August can give them such a necessary rest. "
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the market launch of new brands.
The industry indicator of Coffer Peach Tracker sales in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds 9 billion pounds. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children have a hidden social media account from their parents
As evidenced by the results of the study, every fifth child, sometimes not older than 11 years, has a hidden account in social networks.
A study of 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” that they show to their parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a net “core” account, which is shown to parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw there a call "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them.
Aileed Doyle will become the “representative of the interests of athletes” in the Council of Scottish Athletics
Eilid Doyle is elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an independent director during the annual general board meetings.
Doyle is Scotland’s top track and field athlete. Council chairman Ian Beatty called the move a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of its extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by involving her in the council, athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am inspired to be a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I will really be able to benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is now a sports columnist for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I managed to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I will perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your support!”
In the advertising of the milk sucker, women were compared with cows - the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk suckers has faced an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to live cows.
To mark the release of the product, dubbed "the world's first silent native milk sucker", consumer goods technology company Elvie has released a humorous music video style ad to showcase the freedom provided by the new sucker to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cowshed to a song that contains the words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, this is not a udder, but my breasts."
Next, the choir sings: "Suck, suck, so that children can feed. Suck, suck, so that milk does not waste."
However, a promotional video posted on the company's Facebook page caused a stormy discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users was ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken away from them a few days after birth,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk suction agent can be easily hidden in a bra for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not attract them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies? ”
Someone else added: “This advertisement is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke out in defense of the commercial. One of the women of the video turned out to be "very funny".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd definitely buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
By sucking the milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content in it.
Great product,” someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Funny ad targeting moms who suck off milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, the sucker Elvie works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a bra for feeding. Due to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented: “Elvie’s suction device is so revolutionary that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Drawing a parallel between women who are milk-healing and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has made headlines.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk with this product during a clothing show from fashion designer Marta Yakubovski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for children to be placed with caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that Bureau employees had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who committed an offence.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum workers, in order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days as it was before.
Many will be able to take advantage of video conferencing rather than going to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, according to the court decision, are not eligible for asylum will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists say that these problems are exacerbated in institutions of a larger size, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk exacerbating the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered the “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their troops
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "treating them would be appropriate."
“They should leave immediately and not put conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terror is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria. They mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
Regarding refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created the proper conditions for their return. He also accused “some Western countries” of “spreading unfounded fears” due to which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help bring people back,” he said.
"We are seeing an effort to politicize a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not help Syria rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats will report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive of Syrian forces, supported by Russia, in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has a "clear timeline", and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including militants of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem put forward conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers probably hope, he does not resign early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, it would be "the most dramatic end to the presidency of all time"!
At the moment, the audience does not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Burr, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced humor writer and author of Just Funny Moments: As well as a few harsh truths about infiltrating a Hollywood men's club, offers a different theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he'll make me laugh," he said. That's the story Ms. Skovell told me.
Chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Detachment is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it can’t be said that you’re just trying to stay informed citizens when you watch for six hours as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s ostrich jacket for $15,000 (“clothes for the arrogant,” the Washington Post wrote about this in a shocking description of the consequences.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The reality show’s feeling is partly due to the fact that you’re getting something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the TV program “Stars of the pawnshop”, about the rotations in the cast and the daily plot twists in the show “Trump” (conflict with the NFL, support Kim Jong-un).
If you allow yourself to miss just one episode, you can hopelessly fall behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flace at his home on the north coast of the island of Kauai this week, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from the TV — not when Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we made all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External infusions of funds in the toughest midterm elections in Congress
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania sent additional cash infusions, because due to the revision of the boundaries of the constituencies of the two incumbent Congressmen compete for one chair.
In the fight for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, the borders of which were recently changed, comes a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb confronts another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old neighborhood boundaries were framed in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a fierce confrontation between the financial divisions of the main parties, the Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's surname became very famous in Pennsylvania after a victory with minimal advantage in the 18th district during the by-election to Congress in March, which enjoyed wide public attention.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed his mind
Diplomats recalled the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported the position of Beijing.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Previously, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners expelled the staff hired by the Trump Organization from there.
State Department officials have decided to recall heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” the department’s spokeswoman Gezer Neuert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place last year, and it was regarded as a step forward in efforts aimed at curbing the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of them diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn History
The next nuisance could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, strong evidence of why can be found in the public information currently available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly verifying a possible link between the Trump campaign and an attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes into other hands, Trump will have to report to congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to fellow party members.
There’s a lot of “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, like his counterparts in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the unbridled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
There are a number of such red flags waiting for the Americans.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble even when this newspaper appeared information that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the President and shared his thoughts on the topic of Trump’s inconsistency with the post.
Rosenstein called the information in the newspaper The Times inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, who recently launched the FBI, proves to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court is approved despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, above all, will we in the medium term vote for those members of Congress who can bring Trump to justice?
If we fail these tests, bad times will come for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
Having such a legacy, can I not look optimistically into the future?"

Graham Dorrance from Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Viennese Rapid
FC Rangers hosts Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in a game with Villarreal earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance of leaving Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time of the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2: 2. However, he believes that Rangers FC can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal are a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to the game with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could go ahead, but in general, a draw can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of fans. I am sure that we will be able to fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has returned to normal.
We have a great staff, and all the guys are happy. Training is going well.
I hope we can move on, leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with children.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not in a hurry to start a conversation on this topic,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's what you need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not inform your relatives in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining cost.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise on how to cover the relevant costs.
Long-term care funding sources include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-insurance at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal burdens in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can not do it personally.
In addition, we advise you to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of cash.
Choose a trustee who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs emergency medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances. It’s about who the doctors are,” Martin says.
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog?
Prepare such a plan.”
In Ilfracum, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle as he was returning home from the party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 02:30 British summer time, as an "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the death toll could rise.
Due to the breakdown of communications, officials dealing with humanitarian assistance cannot obtain any information from the regency of Dongal, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a few basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Dongala located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 according to 2017 data.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to 2017 data, there are approximately 299,200 people living in the regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are a few of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 magnitude was recorded near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidijaja Regency in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to an Alaska State Police report released on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing reporting of a case of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman friend tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna detention center with the right to make a pledge of $ 500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, involving an arrest of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B misconduct, which is punishable by a prison day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as obstructing reporting of a case of domestic violence and carrying a weapon while intoxicated when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and electricity networks have gone offline, and the death toll could rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed in social networks, shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for terror suspect in New York
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saipov was allegedly driving a home-depot-leased pickup truck on a bicycle path along a highway in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began hitting cyclists and pedestrians that happened to him on the way.
According to a report of intent to seek execution filed in the Southern District of New York to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to court materials, each of these charges provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of extortion-related murder, which federal prosecutors routinely charge in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers, who described the crime committed by Saipov as “horrible, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of “careful planning and premeditated intent.”
The victims Syfulla Habibullaevich Saipov injured, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as described in the report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since New York’s Southern District last launched a criminal case that carries the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty on a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953. The couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court materials, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he did not regret the crime.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to conduct an attack on ISIS videos that he viewed on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of admitting guilt and sentencing to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the psychological trauma caused by these events for all victims,” Patton said.
The defense side of Saipov earlier also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
MP from the Conservative Party believes that Nigel Farage should be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party Congress, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the Independence Party of the United Kingdom said that politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, since one of the deputies of Parliament Theresa May offered his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "already be out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems faced by May, trying to reconcile their deeply divided ranks, was even more attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who are opposed to the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not give up trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos”.
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihal, Mr Bone said he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He invited Mr Farage to come out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have already come out,” he said.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars in order to obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed the suggestion that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and don't want to go out is absolutely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of voters.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an address to Theresa May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their office when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians should "feel the pressure" if they were going to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them they can’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political elite, who plan to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We will mobilize the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis scoffed at the Conservatives because security issues arose after the conference opened because of their party program.
“These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously think” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the election in November, she "will seriously think about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during a general meeting in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against Republican Party member Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered as the main candidate who can compete with trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she plans to participate in the election for the presidency.
Warren responded that "it's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that, he has to have a woman at his head."
Arrested suspect in the murder of the gun basketball player “LSU Tigers” Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported that on Friday arrested a suspect in the murder of gun basketball player “LSJ Tigers” Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting asking for help identifying the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of the University of Southern on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result,” Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade gave in to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a weapon with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and averaged 17.4 minutes on the field, gaining 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reduced the gap in the fight for the world title after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position in the first two corners and gave Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went on a pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was to decide everything.
The driver of the Mercedes team went through another round and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after a certain maneuver with the wheel to the wheel, as a result of which the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the inner space because of the risk that he would be squeezed, after he managed to break out ahead on the third turn as a result of the double maneuver.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first lap.
Potov led most of the race as he did not change tyres to quickly come to the finish line and move Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped for a pit stop on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace on the last eight, making Raikkonen placed fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri taught full time all weekend and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team has done an exceptional job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
The body language was not affected.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance that she did not divulge the contents of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on events in the Senate that, he said, demonstrated human "forgiveness, meanness, and lying."
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see angry people showing meanness, meanness and lying,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the information that was released, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you divulge the information?
Remember her answer... did you divulge the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't tell you."
Wait a minute.
We have been divulging?... No, we have not divulged,” he added, copying the Senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges put forward by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September his content was made public, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred in her office.
“I did not hide the accusation of Dr. Ford, I did not disclose the information received from her,” Feinstein said, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objection did not seem to please the president, who commented during a Saturday rally: "I'll tell you, her body language was not at all impressive.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but I haven’t seen anyone hold on any worse yet.”
While continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate who has been accused by three women of sexual assault, the president has suggested that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see meanness, dishonesty, they don’t care who they offend, who they have to step over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants, 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league by the Belfast Giants, winning the match-answer with a score of 5:3.
The Giants gained an early two-goal advantage thanks to pitches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized the score in the home game, and then Dwyer again led the Giants forward.
Dundee player Francois Bouchard equalised, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third season of the elite league defeat of the team of Adam Keef, who received a strong-willed victory over Dundee with a score of 2-1 on Friday evening in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season. The previous three matches were won by the Giants team.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaul's transfer, and four minutes later, Beauvillier, who received the goal from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10), Sullivan returned the field hosts to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, receiving a goal from Matt Marquardt, equalised the score.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, dropping his second goal at the end of the first period.
The owners of the field regrouped, and Bouchard in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again leveled the score, throwing the puck when his team numerically prevailed.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he led Dundee forward for the first time and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, will play an away match against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller killed so hundreds of people on plane could avoid earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive tsunami-triggering earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong tremors continue to rock the area, with many people trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower, which was greatly swayed, at the Muthiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely in the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian company-provider of aeronautical services Johannes Sirite said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, according to the Australian Agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which should take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country’s disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase as many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo spokesman Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which on Sunday there will be mass graves.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man went missing
The airline, which was on a flight that crashed at the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it has previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said it was unable to find one passenger as of Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and for this they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane while in the water.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade the jetty also helped in the rescue operation, taking people ashore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data for the last two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to PNG-registered airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told members of the jury how he used cell phone footage to recreate the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that evening, which contradicts his previous claim.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my pickup truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Gale said.
The defense must lay out its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The trio of hip-hop artists want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The group The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature - it has abandoned political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a resurgence in the United Kingdom through bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for release, receiving a “racist” message
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NO, ONE MORE TEMNOSHKIRA,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
As the New York Post reports, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, did not do her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple, hoping to get a refund for the pay she would have received for the six months of working with the couple she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said that Maurice's release was a smart decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with someone you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
ANYTHING."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and “hasn’t recovered yet.”
“Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad thing,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, a public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As described in the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear that is able to speak.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to be printed, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading a book for the first time before it's published.
Now it’s funny, because we know about the huge success that the story of Padington has gained.”
Talking about how her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt "joy and sadness" at the same time, because her father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a pretty humble man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, like his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although these are not their, not our victories.
I think he looked at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to 2 Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
“He called me regularly, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperous said.
“And then Nad called me and told me that she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped working and left the body.
She died some time before everyone was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at that time.
I couldn’t grieve, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have kept it in my hands.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe tests she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on the Welsh bridge with phone numbers that people can turn to for support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid it will have consequences.
Ms Davis created the postcards "so that people know that there are those they can reach out to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
“Don’t shut yourself up, you have to talk.”
Miss Humphries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he completely lost heart. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eye or anything. "
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it: "It put a devastating
should be in the family.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we were asking for — a limited time and nature of the investigation — we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “collapsing” amid a hopeless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans will have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct through the election of their own person to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned senators asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit, a vote will be held.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of defectors from North Korea "decreased"
After Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Pyeong Seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of defectors was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were increased border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals were now demanding more money.
Pyongyang has refrained from making public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issues of denuclearization, negotiations on which have stalled.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, amid the sanctions, accused the United States of lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong-ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I kept thinking that if a woman ever acted this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh behaved very emotionally, at times almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation" orchestrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally withdraw his candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to declare Kavanaugh impeached if his guilt was confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not good for the Supreme Court, he’s not good for the court where he’s working now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Rowe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time when the judge will be hysterical, biased person and we will say how great it is,” said Pelosi.
Women should own these weapons.
These are just words, which contained accumulated months and years of rage, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: “A woman who worked as an executive somewhere and helped me a lot said that she also cries when she is angry, but she had her own method. When she got angry and started crying, she told the interlocutor: “You may think that I am sad and because of that I cry.
I am evil.”
And after that, she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of my first job in a male-dominated office was one where I was crying out of indescribable anger, and the older woman, an inhospitable manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he quit the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very deliberate decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"The race has already involved seven other candidates, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she made a promise that she would not participate in the race if she did not raise $ 2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret supporting the men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was seized with emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and forced her to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger at sexism. She was ready to cry.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although it is far from over, in the long term, the split between the countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated this week due to new tariffs on goods with a total value of $ 200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually imposes a tax on half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing a duty of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to take similar measures to the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss an opportunity to keep that promise anytime soon.
To force Washington to back down is to accept the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, US public worship is too shameful.
However, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the trade war with the United States can bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to a sharp economic fall in any of the countries. And this actually poses a greater threat than observers have previously recognized," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a war-torn country that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their means of subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the riot.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when they defeated the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament here since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, punched his first long-range kick at the 16th hole of par-3 in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players to ever pass with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a score of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who occupies the first place in the world ranking, lost with a score of 2: 1 Jan Poulter from England, who may have participated in the tournament “Rider Cup” for the last time.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the most tournaments in all time, bringing in 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It's been a rough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
This is a merit of the team, and I am glad that I was able to help,” Garcia said, without holding back emotions after winning in Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Rehm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 single game.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram said.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the most outstanding players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried to reach the Fairway area throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said of his team after the disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
Take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the Professional Golf Players Association of the United States and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to praise them.
We lost."
