Semilarski v. Prosecutor’s Office: the cassation of the former Vice-Mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances to consider the claim Semilarsky refused, but in April his cassation appeal was taken into consideration by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019 the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as her permission was not within its jurisdiction.
The court decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the district court should regulate such issues,” press secretary of the Tartu courts Anette Kreitsmann told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the Lord will have to say his word.
According to Semilarski’s defense attorney, juror Oliver Nees, his client had been unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor’s office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for submitting the complaint to the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Luuna District Prosecutor’s Office Margus Gross, made in October 2017, when Semilarsky, along with another then Deputy Mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“We would like to remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local self-government bodies, were corrupt.
These public suspicions, hanging in the air, accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarsky said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaez, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The allegations of bribery and venality have proven to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Nees said.
“Semilarski’s public presentation as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being investigated is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, former deputy mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu more than thirty times participated in the meetings of the city government in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarsky actively communicated at a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor’s office has charged Semilarsky with accepting a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
At the time, prosecutors and the Security Police said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov’s case later reached a court that fully justified the policy.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally the next historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step of rate reduction, as well as the tone of the statements of the Central Bank and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon stop.
“We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation falling from 4% in 2021,” said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanding, the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (previously expected by 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to 38 and 40 dollars per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, according to economists for Russia and the CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point immediately due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy stalled due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of additional adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a near pause in the easing of interest-rate policies - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic-prevention measures, and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on the mortgage, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.

In the autumn session at the plenary session of the state Duma plan to consider in the second reading the bill establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the purchase, the participants of which can be only small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of the application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, execution and composition of the application for participation in the purchase are set by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
“As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the inability to participate in such procurement and reduce the number of participants in the procurement,” the bill says.

"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

But only now the situation has been moved from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
Completion date 2022.
And this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
So far, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - improvement of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your county.
The demographics here are the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure of children of all ages, - said Acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product acceptance from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the place, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste treatment complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have grown dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands for reclamation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soils, degassing systems and infiltrate drainage are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a useless heap among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruz, where literally recently completed the reclamation of the landfill "Annino", the authorities are considering the option of making a heap of ski slope.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto, already littered with garbage.
“Some time will pass, the training ground will “sit down”, the fortress will gain, and we will think what can be done so that it begins to bring benefits.
Directly in the eyes of the ski resort, "- said the head of the Ruza district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The landfills "Torbeyevo" in Lyubertsy and "Timokhovo" in the Bogorodsky district will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide for the landfill’s own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste recycling complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino", which was closed after residents complained about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills of the Moscow region," - said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only adorned Hagia Sophia
Once again about Ayia-Sofia - the text of Fr.Vladimir Zelinsky was caught, which, they say, must be protested.
First of all, there was free entry - hurray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to enter the House of God free of charge than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka Interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
Americans have conquered America.
Are we gonna give it back to everyone?
Do you think that there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, where the Tithe Church is located?
Third, the Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
That is, they are the same as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their ownership belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything, from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all just progressives.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid inkjet, there was a stupid inkjet with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of an official of the British Foreign Office, Toynbee, who believes it is shameful to think so.
A place of prayer for all believers.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to go away - he goes away to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not an advocate.
We're koloboks, not grim-stones.

The decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
The President of the Russian football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment is wrong.

I knew Bryant's self-esteem couldn't be touched by some kind of thrash-current, so as not to stimulate his athletic anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk him on the set so that he wouldn’t perceive the game in an aggressive way.
On the court I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Kobe, good score, good pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he forgot a little bit about the fact that you need to once again pick up the ball and score another 3-4 points.
We had a good conversation with Kobi,” Kirilenko said.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in full admiration for the fact that there was a legend next to me, which I saw only on TV.
While I was having so much fun, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon, I lost my enthusiasm, a couple of times covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points,” added the head of the RFB.

“Honestly, I didn’t know that, and I’m in such a knockdown because of this information.
I had no idea that this is still possible in 2020 in Russia,” RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Ministry of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom is switching to the supply of Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles “at normal prices” will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a share of 30%, Rosneft has another 20%, Sodeco has 30% and India's ONGC has 20%.
Khabarovsk Krai has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations of “propaganda of LGBT and feminism”
The actor of the Russian TV series “Chiki”, the creators of which were accused of “propaganda of LGBT and feminism”, responded to the claims to the film.
The authors “understood the severity of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “Rise”.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and common aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of the boy, who dressed in women’s clothing.
He said he was “proud of the work” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when “a man in deep drunkenness shot the set and said that all this is not true.”
“Then there were a couple of cases where we met dissatisfied locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims began to help us,” he concluded.
The case of the shooting, the newspaper explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked the car of the crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police.
Earlier it was reported that the public Commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which placed the Russian TV series “Chiki”.
Baranets accused the creators of the series of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism”, drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains “scenes of physical and psychological violence”.
Also, the ombudsman was outraged by the fact that “the series pays a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation” of the minor character.
Comedy drama "Chiki" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
