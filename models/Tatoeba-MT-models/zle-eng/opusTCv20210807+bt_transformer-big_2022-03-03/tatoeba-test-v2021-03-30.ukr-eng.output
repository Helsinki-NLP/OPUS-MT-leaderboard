Careful with your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.

Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one.

I think that's logical.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.

I can't do it alone.
You need Tom here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot know the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cola, and fries.
She stole a camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There is a problem with my account.
Tom happily agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
All right?
Maybe you’re the only one who can do that.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom's lying.

Last week I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.

You are lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how to do it.
Drunk?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she likes to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I only went to Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do it.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are pleased with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He stood at the door.
She was crying bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
She'll find out.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is done.
When I walked into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When are you expecting to come?
Tom threw out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We have to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn’t want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll have a bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring is coming.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We have to invent a secret language.
Do you plan to stay long?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase down.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant hole.
Put salt on the wound.

Tom wiped dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The next month, Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year, millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
All in chocolate.
They moved to a different religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I’ll buy a new car.
We are to blame.
You're so cute.
It will cost about $15.
I slammed the door.
His theory is worth the attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.

I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn’t tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We need to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom is going to Boston.
Who says you can do this?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I stood up to her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have a right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
London is foggy.
I'm really glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to see him.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please, don't be angry.

I could never do that without your help.
I always have coffee and snacks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.

I read this story in a book.
Does Tom have a bike?
Keep it short.
Tom is smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom will not do that.
I hope Tom understands.

I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.

You'll stop.
She waited for hours for him.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?

Tom will probably do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.

I turned on the TV, there was a Grand Prix broadcast.

It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't wasted any time.
Who knows when Tom will do that?

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I was wrong.

Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
Obviously, Tom doesn't talk to Mary.
I have to leave tomorrow morning.

What's the guy's name?
I always get up at half past eight.
Did I ask you to do that?
That’s what Tom finally did.
I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He turned the corner.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
You made three mistakes.

I'm sorry, please.
What's in your backpack?
This time we have evidence.

He also speaks French.
Aren't you ready to help us?
I doubt that a new proposal will be accepted.

No effort to achieve anything.
Want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at the age of 65.
I lost my pen.
I will continue to work.
I was at a meeting yesterday.
Layla's late.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she did it.
I'll be in Boston for a few days.
I've already done that.
I stayed after school to help clean the classroom.
Everyone wants something.
Does Tom have green eyes?
I always forget people’s names.
Why are you asking me?
I'm just looking.
Tom said he didn't care if he won or not.
Do you speak French well?
You don't really have to do that.
I think Tom's in Boston right now.
I was scared.
I can read in English.
Tom helped me wash my car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I take care of my grandfather.
I'm going to leave around ten in the morning.
Did you come by train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
In Rome, they act like Romans.
He saw an expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up and you'll catch the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom will actually do it.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell the car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom is scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I have Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like more butter.
Obviously Tom likes it here in Boston.

The guy I love doesn't love me.
You're very busy.
I'm done for today.
I signed the check.
She gave me a shirt.
Mary trusts me.

We had a good time yesterday.

That day will come!

You're one of us.
It is very nice of you to help me.
Choose an event that you remember well.
What are you gonna have?
Tom has a good alibi.
I'll treat you.
He fucked her.
I don't think Tom wanted to do it himself.
Hello!
Buy me a bike.
The party is in full swing.
Tom is not helping me.
Do you agree with us?
Entomology is not just about learning how flies fly!
Tom didn’t want to read a book.
I'll be outside.
If you come here again, I'll call the police.
I know it will be difficult.
Did you get permission to park here?
Anyone can do that.
I'm so tired.
It's time for us to go.

Both Tom and Mary looked at John.
Tom said Mary needed to do it.
She managed to get the truth out of him.
You've already done it.
I'm fed up with your nonsense.
What are you teaching?
Tom is not dead yet.
Tom looked under the couch.
I'll find a way to do it.
Hey! Do not run near the pool!
They met in the classroom.
Tom has good manners.
English is not my native language.
Stop Tom.
Tom wanted to listen to Mozart.
Tom, what do you want for dinner?
It's stupid to teach the dead to count.
You're wrong.
Tom's car ran out of gas.
I'm running out of money.
Tom has a decent salary.
I will answer one more question.
I'm going to work right now.
Don't believe everything you hear about Tom.
Spring has arrived.
I am looking forward to my birthday.
Not so much!
I can wait if you want.
I am very grateful for everything you have done for me.
Don't talk to me.
Behave well.
Tom apologized to me for being late.
They have twelve children.
How did the exam go?
Can you climb a tree?
You're a smart guy.
Don’t open the door to anyone.
The train arrives at the fifth platform.
How many cats are in this house?
I heard you screaming.
What about going to the movies?
Tom is extremely successful.
Why did she want to talk to me?
I often go to Tom's house.
It doesn't bother me.
The boy bowed his heart to the dog.
I am afraid of earthquakes.
Each country has its own story.
The salt is gone.
How do you know when to stop?
Tom is persistent.
Her eyes stopped at the dress.
My father served in the Navy.
Tom said he thinks I'm charismatic.
Talk to me.
See ya!

It’s the same bike as mine.
They dance.
Just wait!
Come here.
Don't be so narrow-minded.
I live in the city.
I don't want you to touch my things.
I don't know.
It's a hard job for us.
I'm impressed.
Is it hot?
It's in my pocket.
Tom said he wouldn't do it.
Thank you for your interest.
You don't have to answer that question.
I saw Tom this morning.
I'll start soon.
Have you ever seen a wolf?
Tom said Mary couldn't do it.
Tom didn’t want to say goodbye.
The street is empty.
White paint will make the room lighter.
Do you like rap?
Are your grandparents still alive?
I know you're not.
I'd tell you, but I promised Tom not to do it.
Stay focused.
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
I know your name.
Mary lost her hat.
All Tom wanted was some free time.
Tom said he was going to Australia.
