In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Khersons managed to hold a rally before the military fleet with equipment arrived at the place for dispersal.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there,” said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and regional councils.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, is wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title "City Hero".
On February 24, President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launcher systems and ballistic missiles.

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city - ed.) - people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we can not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we are stating.
We believe in our result, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but “we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them.”
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but ... every family has lost something - and I do not think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You can’t fight for the dust, when there is nothing, there are no people.”

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become necessary to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine noted that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by following the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you went to school, we'd surprise you.
Boulogne is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are questioning each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And nothing surprised me at all. What happens is exactly what I was sad and expected...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces and for a moment did not doubt that in the event of occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not spare.
For I have been and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the shooting case of the great-grandfather: the whole matter is more than a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, the guilt was denied.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-yard" noble, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the ploughman and feeder of young children to execution.
The family did not even know the location of the funeral.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
Apple from the apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls ...
The shooting trio that led to the execution of peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia such as the Immortal Barrack, which qualitatively remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
As if the computer found files with child pornography, she was put in prison, and there he died quickly.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
On top of a thousand-year-old tradition imposed slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries.
And then over what turned out to be made a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 semi-French film Chequist, that's what happened.
You saw my photos in the swimsuit.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough?
Sorry, I have no one to ask.
I was wondering if you know where the kids went because Galya can't find them.

You are very helpful, thank you!!

As reported by “European truth”, this writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the version on the APC Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr in the shortest possible time will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?

Lydia has already been admitted to school, but we will go to the teacher on Tuesday because of the illness I reported today
I sit, hold my headphones in my ears, listen to music and think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, sweetheart, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I take it that we're together. That we're a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I’m not afraid that I didn’t get into any of them.
I don’t know what will happen to the house.
I need to pass the examination for the manufacture of a food license. Can I do this with you?
Tell me please, tomorrow for 5 guests to prepare an apartment.
Fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Lay out and cover the sofa?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, which has already been used, but it is working but not necessary.
Write an address in Czech, see on the map where it is from us
I don’t know how much space there is, so I can’t plan anything with the furniture I want this week to finally look at that apartment and then understand what furniture I need
Sorry to have answered so long, working was a day, hard to adapt
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have that opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
For a child there is already a bed and a bath, things at first found
Don’t forget that you promised to help me, as you will have the opportunity, but not the last to give
I want to get a haircut called a hat.
Oleg got sick - runny nose and cough. Better Yana do not take with you to us, so as not to get infected
Only I'll be a little later - somewhere at 8. Can I?
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be fine!?
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excarcies!
I know how important this is to you!
And I’m not talking about myself (for me, it’s just the top that I can’t reach)!
How do you feel today? After the party?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kolya and I didn't translate the test very well yesterday.
I will ask Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If there is such a possibility, I want to tighten the mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that there were no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are hoping for that too.
She is very happy with any gift.
I would like to connect the Internet to my Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn’t stay away.
Now we agreed that we would be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designed specifically for filing and processing applications for assistance
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
Don't worry, I'm just a person.
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I did not go. Yes, the heat itself. This I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Five years ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass shootings of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility, linked to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight has to go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved residents of cities it blockaded and allowed them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shootings in Babi Yar.
For over a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "never again!" means not only to speak out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat the evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected
All were sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was an omicron a new kind of covid
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this card instead of the car.
Call for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 pounds.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in war conditions, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to “disturb” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast “The Swearing Questions”, together with the editor of “European Truth”, we talk about how the NATO memorandum has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed at the talks with Russia can become the second one.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner marked that my Statement is under consideration.
I sent it through this mobile app.

Denise is in a good mood today.
I arranged with a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school, so that he showed him everything.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had surgery on his heart.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he asked me to marry him, and he died two days later.
God has decided our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a home, and I am very happy about this - now I have where to live and where to be with a child.

I fully understand the price of unskilled labor and understand that such a job as I had at home in Kiev, I will not be able to have the money that I earned at home, here now I will not receive either.
But just sit and do nothing I can not, because then all the bad thoughts go to the head, so you need to do yourself some kind of physical

I don't remember that schedule.)
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “they have never done this before”
Direct language Konashenkov: "We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of a full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital’s Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhychi near Babi Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed rocket of the occupiers shattered a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to blame the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda said that a “Ukrainian shell” had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves into a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky is not talking to them so much as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, tenderness and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While Biden is strongly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don’t want to be considered a fraud.
The money you raise is better given to people who are more in need.
I can come to you and already decide on the spot. I still want to help

Contact: ------ I would like a letter, so that the Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS is not here, they do not have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, then do not agree.
You really don't want this price tag?

If you don't need a price list, I won't put it up.
Tell me how you want it and I will do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today.
Don't worry, I didn't come asking for anything.

He's chipping away at the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now ..... will agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, everything we've spent at home.
Many of our managers, on our jobs did not give a salary.
Where do I go ?? Who do I need ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you'd drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don’t know what to eat tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you pull children all over Prague.
And what's next ? Unknown. How much so ? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. You're expensive.
And of all irons, we don't have that.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children in danger, or try to escape here.
She was very pleased with those hearts and those things that she was given to the children when she came to school.

These are heroic leaders who without fear go to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipelines and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits to the front.

In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and do not work on-line queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, it takes a long time to travel by train, it will be difficult for the child.
So I decided to look for a place in Prague or not far from it.

By that time - they put such stamps and then likened these stamps to visas
The Foreign Election District of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.

Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
The head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is beginning a “fake operation” on the weapons that are handed over to us by the allies.
Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "break down" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it is massively switching to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn you about these scams right away.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to that world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much boule the garden cost per month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a "violation of international law".
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who had left the area after occupation for weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the charges as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is “another staging of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia’s Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an “investigation” into Ukraine’s dissemination of “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shootings in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty saw bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small city.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian - were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents say was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." As the occupiers smuggled Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another item, which is now much less information - the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
From about mid-March, the Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military range.
Ukrainska Pravda sought out deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” was taking place and whether there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine on swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true flakes, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They had no cars and no buses.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At the 6th evening of February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They say, "Is there anyone?" - I say yes. - "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said: “The Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a detachment of the UNA-UNSO Viking nationalist movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - the UP), now we have come to help you.”
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that water, she had a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of “the Russians will take it anyway” and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So it was they who brought the sausages after the robbery of the store and said: “We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.”
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones," they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: “Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can’t do anything, because there are our families there.”
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg with a St. George ribbon, and the other with his white scotch and called it a “militia”.
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: “Do you have artillery?”
Moreover, we had joint detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - our constantly got into it from "Bayraktar".
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The name "Kiev has already given up" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - it was about Bucha, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "Then feel sorry for your children's psyche!"
How it worked: They drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either "Cities" or mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit to the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it is for traitors of the motherland - they say, "you are shot there, they will sell you to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road were burned, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately take the equipment to them.
A lot of caponires, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we underwent improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! Shoots a rocket, and it can be seen - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning on the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.
Its leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I am a hooker, I am from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenka will not stop until these thieves are killed.
Poor people are suffering!
Lukashenka is so good!
As he says, so it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: “You are traitors!”
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with documents - the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take the bus.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were brought to Minnesota, and we were escorted.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies out, shines beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozyr, said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from ranges.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, “You lie, we are a peaceful people.”
They do not perceive that their ranges are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian ones.”
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to - the house is no longer there.
Nobody really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go to the center on Monday?

On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the joyful news - the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that at least 280 civilians were shot by Russians in Bucha alone.
They were killed simply on the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the chief of the village of Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewers.
Both sides of the route 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes “European truth”.
“All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So what, when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their positions, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “Not yet, not yet.”
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different appearance.
“It would unfold differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
My dream is that the war is over and I want to go home.

And then he made me an offer.
“There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and it was hailing.

“I tell her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio’ was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to be too loud when calling.”
“We have been hiding from the mother-in-law of the war for a whole month.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in the film (cat - UP) on the belly and hind legs licked fur - it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her “incognito”.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
“For 33 days, I lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there formally came, as always, for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in his room.
The bad news is that it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who talks to her. It's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to me about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaning :)
Good evening, I didn't think about it :)

The British, who in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a member of the brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke to him
Eislin tweeted: “It’s been 48 days, we’ve tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war is over soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th separate brigade of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Air Force reporters contacted the soldier's mother, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin’s unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to get into the hands of the so-called “Kadir” troops without weapons and bullets.
Also in social networks distributed an audio recording of a telephone conversation, in which allegedly Eislin speaks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

It's a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill 7176, entitled “On the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere”.
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable - it is an excellent basis for "to bear" all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then to establish manual management.
The same as before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill flies under patriotic slogans, others may take off tomorrow - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse supervisory councils in one way or another has been circulating among some people’s deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company’s work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the movement of members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the solution proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect from the loss of the supervisory board’s ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to this!
People's Deputy, the author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense industry complex (MIC), now need to be relocated" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is the only one in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All the power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the CEO, who, by the way, will make a decision on the need to relocate one or another enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmitry on his page in Facebook also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let’s try to sort out some of them: “respectable foreign experts at the first word “war” actually leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time they remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is at war.”
Firstly, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, will introduce a strengthened curfew for 2 days.
Direct speech of Pavlyuk: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew is strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm signal to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk called on people who have left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military countries in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets signal installation near Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railway trains.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the force support of SOBR special forces, one was wounded.
According to "Spring", when detained, the men were actively resisting and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the “BZD” and the administrator of thematic resources “BZD” in “Vkontakte and “Classmates” Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports ?belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The BYpol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus as part of the Victory Plan.
Belarusian “rail partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia’s largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector exits include manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

I would gladly rent a house with some decent girl.
If you know this, let me know.
For my part, I will not let you down.
Thanks in advance.
Did not write you another person Natalia 54 years.Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name since I was born :)
Good afternoon Mr. Reyrard! I'm sorry I haven't seen it. I'll do it now and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to the medical board right now.
I need to work this hour another day.
What day is it better to come earlier? (maybe on what day is a little more work?)
Tomorrow I listen, the Internet does not work well.
You're doing what you're gonna do.
Thank you.. some found from things,but from the technique there was nothing...
Both beginners, except for the alphabet, do not know anything.
Nothing's happening.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04.?
Children can be taken with them, there are enough toys here :)
I thought about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Need to take with you the clothes that were given?
today is not my day. broke blinds in the living room. in the morning one. now in the evening another
Something has come from you, I don't see what
I am also very sad.
I'll remind you about the invoice later
Do you only speak and understand Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and in line.
Raj to honor Joe Dispenza, he is scientifically conducting research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new connections neurons
1+1 journalist Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they did not have weapons to participate in the fighting, and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "The bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the connection of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin in Mariupol.
According to the leader of “Azov” Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant “Azovstal”, which is held by the soldiers of the regiment “Azov”.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, while we stay here
2 hours drive)) walk, mom shop and back)!)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was going to do here.
The squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” in Ukraine sent the day before thanks to the Deputy Mukachevo city Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/example101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they received special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use the copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will now leave their location in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I did not worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can also without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
I’m going back to South Africa soon and I’m still working.
Okay. If it's all right, I'll agree
I'll try to myself, but if there are gaps, I will write to you, if you can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the old lady in the village in Jiviv,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll be in a good mood.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have.
Mom and Dad need to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and it was raining. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But do not harm the destroyed houses, the harm of people who are abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers got bored with the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, gutted panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Dropped the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we have no such custom so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given
I have someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live in a dormitory By twelve people will be here, and then they go to work
Hi, it's a little better.
I was already in the closet today.
I was already sleeping there today.
That’s why we already have great progress.
I’ll definitely bring some other stuff together!
I don’t have the strength to do it today.
Since I am repelled from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
In May, I can say about the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write off dinner for a long time and slept a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is modest in our country, he has been studying a lot lately. I realized that he needs this very much in his life
Hi, it went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economy department of the edge of the hill.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the manger.
On Monday I have to bring a confirmation of employment and cash payment for the nursery.
I'm leaning from Friday
I don’t do anything but sleep a lot (and drink a lot of water)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I need another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
Very poorly working drain tank, poorly washes. Need a master. Need to set up.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
Should you bring your children with you or feed them with you?
And now for a moment you can come to one question
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't really want you to raise funds from the beginning so people wouldn't think we were speculating on this!
But for online filling I did not have two points:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It'll be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
Collected some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we have to have an internet connection.
I want to be your backup designer.
How will I be credited with the day that I was not at work is a pass
Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state.”
It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
It is likely that in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the loss of personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
The enemy feels a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of combat operations, will continue strikes on the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or disable them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of Dovgenka and Dmytrivka settlements, had no success and withdrew to the previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the Golden area, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue storming operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements Vysokopilya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We'll try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll keep you awake?
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll figure it out.
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and even more 1+1. We do not need to configure :)
I'll turn on the TV here just to listen to the Czech language.
I'm running out of a month's worth of money today :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I think I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many pies.
I'll see my dad later, I'll see you later.
I read the ad on Facebook ,I guess Google wrote something in its own way . . . I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we have the things that you brought, but there are things that are small for us to bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If the director is satisfied, then next week I can start going to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it turns out, because the queues are very large) and on Saturday it is raining :)
I am looking for a team in the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work on Teve
Friends are old and not very, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a hard time.
Over the past month, I’ve talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of why they are subjecting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, - as usual, laconicly answered Sasha. - Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others, cultural figures, artists, critics, writers, are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked for Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny’s organization, and a number of other places — how many of you have done anything to oppose this regime?
Except for the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which is now probably a big burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had some freedom and democracy — messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of trouble that you seek salvation behind the king’s back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of grabbing and releasing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the stasis, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to lay low, to renew, to reform and to seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between robbing the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started equating Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the children who were killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're fed up with your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zeros, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look past his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to make good money, some have gotten rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, haven’t they?
Moscow was festively shining and shining with chic.
When several opposition members — Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the case did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and himself took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, most of you ignored it or went silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there is such a big temptation to Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
At the end of 2011, my Russian friends woke up.
When Putin switched seats again with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively came out to protest.
Navalny’s name became a nickname, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he hit back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I have heard it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who has deluded their European aspirations, they once seized Maidan — and never left it.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
The police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Maidan did not like it very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it is of little use.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We’re not interested in politics,” he said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, like new ones since the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binges, public WiFi and hipster cafes.
In fact, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and is only getting better.
You've barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn’t understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I myself saw state snipers cold-bloodedly shooting at my children's peers in the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
“First they came for the socialists, but I was silent because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I kept quiet because I'm not a union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silent because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or forming a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So I’m sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or, it seems very likely, if he doesn’t succeed — he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to protests and still took place for a short period, but soon will get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even just a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment was given simply for an anecdote are not in such a distant past - and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Then who will speak for you? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage is on paper.
Given everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it all goes to.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: because of the economic collapse looming on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he is of the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been crushed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
A lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly a hundred thousand.
If it turns out to be more than 300 thousand, it will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it gets to the point?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be scared if I were you, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes and die in a raw cell under police batons.
That’s what’s been going on for years, and it’s only going to get stronger and bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
In the evening we will be home
What do you think of me as a press secretary?
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant?
Once at the mouth I go to dinner in an expensive restaurant
I'll try to explain it to her)
So we liked very nice and we wanted something shiny so it's a better option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I was tired of energy.

On Thursday we need a pass, we go with the children to the doctor.
But last night I wrote to a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform you.
While working in the prosecutor’s office, I thought that I was building a career, spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It’s a waste of time, but it’s a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take monogamous issues of marriage seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't seen that.
Hello. Where in the chapter you can buy forms for baking cakes (paper or silicone)?

I went to Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
When the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.

The working time of the room is until 16:00.
In the end, it is our responsibility.
