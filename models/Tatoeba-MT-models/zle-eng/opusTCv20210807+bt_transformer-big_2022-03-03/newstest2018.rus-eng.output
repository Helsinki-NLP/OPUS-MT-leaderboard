Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded unfunded contracts, tried in every possible way to evade the obligations to pay and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor’s office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative ones, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for organizing procedural inspections, criminal cases have been initiated for 46 of them.
As a result, debts to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles were repaid.
Moreover, these huge amounts were accumulated not as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
To fabulous debts led to numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs by much more modest amounts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person has invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial comma of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor’s office.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been neutralized as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor’s office operates in manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are examined in detail.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ “On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses Regarding the Establishment of Administrative Liability of Customer Officials for Violation of the Terms and Procedure for Payment of Goods (Works, Services) in Procurement for State and Municipal Needs”, which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurements.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the practical application of these legislative innovations.
Civil rights group warns of movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People travel alert, effective through August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests, and Missouri citizens to be particularly vigilant and exercise increased caution when traveling across the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are cited here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the move was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that state law enforcement agencies were disproportionately targeting minorities.
“People are being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during a trip around the state, and Missouri state police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that says black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money with them for bail or inform relatives that they are traveling around the state.”
According to the FBI’s most recent hate crime report, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th most hate crime reported in the state.
The move warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, was supposed to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown persons fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters, citing the Ministry of internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rosturizm Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC that he “positively” refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
“We need to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transportation of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and say that it is to the outerwear, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even some computer will not be related,” said the head of Rosturizm.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free baggage transportation with a non-refundable ticket.
It is about the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-scale reclamation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the president said.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the holiday.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything needs to be checked, here too, the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
We will remind, on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed about the problems with conducting economic activities by the inhabitants of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Lake Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of normative acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The fleet's Grim EW provided transport support.
The church is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but the cigarette butts carefully store in an iron box seized from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, Chang reports.
You know, since childhood, I have just developed a reflex: you can not throw a candy wrapper on the pavement, they will be immediately fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
Indeed, Singapore’s sidewalks in the city center are clean, like in a museum.
Chang says: Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, understood on the spot observer “AIF”.
Here, no one is thinking of abolishing the death penalty,” explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large consignment of drugs or trades them, he is entitled to a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
The man was eventually hanged.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are carefully bypassing the side.
The point is this: in Singapore, it is mandatory to obey ALL laws in a row, not just modest and not rich people.
It does not matter who you are - a millionaire, Deputy Prime Minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The only option in this case is that if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, by a simple miracle you are given - how many prohibitions in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly by prescription (!) of a doctor.
The tourist will not take away the gum upon arrival, but it is worth sticking a "rubber" in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be added.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: “I trashed.”
For thrown past the urn, buttocks in addition to a fine are often sentenced to a “link to the janitors”: a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays the "criminal", who forgot to wash off the water in a public toilet, and when trying to relieve a small need in the elevator of a residential building, a special detector is triggered - doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing and even excessive watering of the houseplant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singaporean dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not true at all,” Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone involved in their violation.
Why do they persist?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone will be punished along the chain: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive blows with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be whipped and imprisoned.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offenses in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, drinking a portion of whiskey, knows: if stopped, the police will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years sent to prison.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified by the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature".
They say such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are really afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you are delighted if you went into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly - "pattern gap": plastic cups are lying at the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
That's it, the Singaporeans are laughing.
Things happen.
Not every such "crime" will be seized on the spot, but you should know: if you are found, you will not be laundered - because you have violated the law.
Most often this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty homeless people and beggars.
Not everyone on the streets is throwing trash in the bins.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one buckled up behind the wheel until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we must think that people in Russia would also welcome clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here are the corporal punishments - thank you, no need.
The rest of the laws of Singapore are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now, the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when he begins to fight the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else — hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
To be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
A horde of pleasure boat owners and artists portraying the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried.
But he attempted to make sense of it, especially the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta, “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller correctly stated the facts, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
It's about the current sound of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / the miserable scum of your abundant shores."
Never before have "miserable scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not do literary studies - he made it clear that in America Trump is not expected of these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the base of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was designed to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Expelled.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right though to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative carrying America’s flame to a dark world: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against Limbaugh's usual, it really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would have been seen by emaciated, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often hard voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that’s not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eileen Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of play for the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-member Scottish squad would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is being born in Scotland, and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know that and we’re trying to understand and will support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done needs to be done.
British Athletics Federation: What they have done, we have to work with.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why it happened, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Eilide Doyle team chose as its captain.
"Ailid is humble.
Her captain’s speech was great,” Blake says.
“Many athletes, whether Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileen put into her were remarkable."
The winner of the Commonwealth Championship silver medal, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Cup, says the 16 Scots in the British national team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
It will run at 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman worth paying attention to: behind him is a good season, in which there were victories at the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when Lee McConnell was the only Scot on the team.
The captain of the team says that she is “incredibly proud” that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have entered the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Run for Public Office Unless You’re Ready to Listen to Voter Criticism
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism irritated him, of course.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said: “You can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
I will now turn to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor’s subordinates called this claim null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of “well and that”.
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a Democratic-dominated state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He showed a firm hand in the management of the state and commitment to its principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and with jokes shows on his page his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by administration employees with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters mauling the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who appeal to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called cheat, instead of admitting they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life stance.”
In the Facebook era, it’s easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and silenced protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in numbers.
Hohen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media platforms.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casherys of Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington’s era of affordable postal spending, the Internet was about as disruptive as it is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Portzius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was swamped with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means acceptance of it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic amenities at the club “Renaissance”
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a home for the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links, and moved towards the final round last year until losing to Paul Ilse, is attached to the new venue and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we’re seeing how it comes to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job making this place.
He is a strong supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that in his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour tournament.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said a Southport player.
“I didn’t manage to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember him.”
Returns to the fight in his native land Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important,” said resident Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
It was my pleasure to play again, and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
On the field, this trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Wusnam and senior athletes champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn how to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels over highways that can absorb car emissions of carbon monoxide are already being tested on UK roads.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported positive results of tests of the 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel height of 6 meters is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution falls on transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev for a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
TASS reports about it.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the sentence with a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving a sentence in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court at a visiting session in the SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “golden land”
Bardina Degei does not use the stove when preparing her lunch.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just puts sweet potatoes, which here is called "note", directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degeia sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - and this is where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public in front of occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which retains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes an hour-and-a-half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shake-up by a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners, have come here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degeya says, pointing to her bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the cost of which is estimated at $ 78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain a suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy by the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the Papuan highlands in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” the report, published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electrocution — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Nuts dragged on as Papua's resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the natives of Papua,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of the work.
"Because of this, Papua's indigenous people - the mom-mom (women) of Papua - have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to tackle inequality and human rights abuses in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi’s October inauguration, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols at a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government election commission building, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the vita, a dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were told by internal radio communication: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” as it sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of TIME magazine, but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
A local resident of Alphius Jove was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead...I kissed him."
Gen. Yotje Mende, a senior Papua police inspector, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistillo said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and many more were injured.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed condolences to the victims' families and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights abuses.
But they almost immediately made excuses.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed,” he said.
Viranto then retracted his remarks, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody East Timor independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of Paniai received such statements with gloomy distrust.
“I’ve been questioned four times in the last three years, but there’s been absolutely no change,” says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid I’ll be arrested by the military, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighbouring district of Deiyai.
During a clash between villagers and a construction company manager, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of a construction site office owned by the company.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution,” said the twenty-nine-year-old Domingue Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how quickly the wounded were delivered.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
Parliament Deiyai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction with the tribes of mee, moni, tribute and damal, scattered throughout the green areas of the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai by the military in recent years under the pretext of “defending national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among Papua's population, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tubers note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabiré Airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have the money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there’s no work, no money,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudy and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for “insufficient coordination with relevant organizations” despite being given rare video permits.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokowi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development were not fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua are now facing new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry, Arramanata Nasir, dismissed the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so hiding evidence of human rights abuses would be difficult.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local residents broke their silence by saying, “We want freedom,” according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” Gobai, chairman of the tribe’s council, said.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from a greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote given for Jokovi a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says, without raising his head.
“What else were we going to do?”
Fire for the second time covers Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave a seventy-nine-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that swept through a high-rise building - which is coincidentally called the Torch - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We were asleep and woke up from the fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to come down from the fiftieth floor,” a resident of the skyscraper, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, fire crews put out the fire at around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
In the course of the investigation by the administration of the Torch after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected were plating - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the Grenfell Tower insulation system and cladding panels in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region is by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram, who is to blame for his departure from the “First” channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper “Vedomosti” for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milk pump".
Article on how to prevent the "burnout" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat “Let them talk”, it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted.
As reported, TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First channel.
The situation with dismissal may become clearer in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reports RIA Novosti.
According to police, the night before near the checkpoint of the military in the county of Girishk exploded a car bomb.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new incident occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver took a video of the shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video the shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the American Agency for Marine Fisheries in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal clarifies.
A man while snorkeling tried to shoot a shark on the camera, which was held on a special stick.
Having noticed a man, an animal with a length of more than three meters swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did so to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that such behavior of the marine animal was new to scientists.
Became known the cause of the mass brawl in the Urals military center
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan training center, where a mass brawl occurred, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already been revealed.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the page “Vkontakte”, the contract soldiers of the Ural military unit number 31612 violently fought over an unfilled bed.
It all began with the fact that a private named Sayan defiantly ignored the order of the officer to fill the sticking sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
For half an hour, 140 young guys defeated in the barracks of the bed and sink, knocked out the glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CVO denied information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items, including at least 6 percent boarding an aircraft, in their luggage carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 passengers, also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
ATB employees are consciously passing by most often carrying food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having deliberately carried sharp objects through the inspection, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted knowingly carrying prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to see how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport screenings, and how many were doing so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - those who fly the most are smuggled through the inspection.
As the company points out, ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB takes away are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
The head of the EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions
The day after the lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama, designed to reduce emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that now his agency listens more than under previous administrations to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must ensure compliance with 2015 ozone standards at ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Puitt to return to the old norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with states in a comprehensive process to timely meet the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others, and discussed timelines in settling the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point again use his "deferral powers and other statutory powers" to ensure that the rules are "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states filing this week’s lawsuit against the EPA, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The change in the course of the EPA — following our lawsuits — is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog sweeping their cities,” Schneiderman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., as well as the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in sensitive people, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt’s sudden change of course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress Extends Suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF board for the restoration of the VFLA, which released a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the suspension remain in force.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, against - 21, TASS reports.
The IAAF board report stated that the AFLA has made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the reinstatement board, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFL at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was permanently disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which referred to numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Council in the material "Kommersant" "IAAF extended sanctions against the VFLA".
Harmful defeat
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet championship of Russia among the PFL teams, the Novomoskovsk Chemist held an away match against Kaluga FC.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" was in no way inferior to the opponent, but a second of relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the Kaluga region with the score 0: 3, many predicted in advance the easy victory of the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novoskovtsy forced themselves to be considered and acted from a defensive position, but from a position of strength.
In 1 half, the kaluzhans created more and had the advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and with his actions gave partners confidence.
Unfortunately, the attack "Chemik" lacked effort and luck to put the defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the road.
After a break, the game began to run on opposite courses.
The Novomoskovskers played more actively in the attack.
Disturbing bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the Kaluga residents to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga citizens played a role - they more competently and in cold blood spent the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the owners of the field without resistance moved into the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, the Novoskovtsy will fight against the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "Chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting of the Novoskovtsy - 18 h. 30 m. near the Magnolia store (East, 2, building.
Composition "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaity, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The president scolded him for publicly speaking out against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t say that to the press.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
In the published transcript of his first telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull also found a heated quarrel.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should take in refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting” and “dumb,” and insisted that because of the agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day."
Bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on Board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia, the Russians, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
On the site of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city hall, Astamyr Akhba, deputy minister for resorts and tourism of Abkhazia, told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay the relatives of the tourists killed in the explosions for flights and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only a power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudauta district, two explosions thundered at the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the incident, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
Study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be engaged in a grand jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the US presidential election in 2016, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are enough to charge.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then presidential candidate Donald trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised and Mueller himself.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. earlier said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for a compromise on the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice-mayor of Penza detained at the workplace
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue, but the press service of the SU SK assured that they will follow soon.
The mayor’s office of Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of Penza administration.
She oversaw urban issues and land relations, having held this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Department of the State Construction Inspectorate for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina brings up three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet."
In 2012, the monument was installed in the US Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th anniversary, a monument to Yuri Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is the name and surname of the first astronaut in Latvian, and he looks as if he was 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Will Lose Lynch Courts on Stage to Call for Justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the audience in the village of Monroe in Georgia and roared to the little Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main one - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - pulled up a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
The shrill screams broke the silence as the young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a staging.
But when a noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost all the audience actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when the puppeteers lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has fought for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
“We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he says.
"We can't move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching of Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
While the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known two related motives for vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries that were to take place that summer.
Around the same time, according to FBI reports, black enforcer Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says Hester was rumored to have slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loi Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they were driving from prison and approaching the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison," - this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement that not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attack on voting rights,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will have the same."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed an annual performance reproducing that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captures the viewer and tells about that deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that’s what matters.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals of this year’s performance began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites, the rest blacks — gathered indoors and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role never became easier.
“I think I got dirty because that’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, enraged that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Raccoon screams in response.
There's a hit.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is it," Asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga' back then."
"Yes, yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to call it a solid 'r'."
And the energy in the room also changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it turns out clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
The audience is almost equal in number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the performance; many live very close by.
They spent nearly eight hours enduring Georgia's heavy spirits while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders were only history, but now, when they stand in the same place where lynched people, it seems that their ghosts are immediately in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Greene invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and move bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors drop ropes from their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona embraces the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the performance finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience will sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynchings are still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called what the police are shooting at.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers her work as a human rights activist at a meal, captured the general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
“The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.
The court fined Navalny for violations on the “agitation Saturday”
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violation of the order of organization of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under part 8 of article 20.2 of the administrative code of the Russian Federation “repeated violation of the order of organization of the rally”.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow Khyzyr Mussakayev finished to consider the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the staff of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday”, which Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the campaign materials, the police officers who followed the participants of the subbotnik considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to first request permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the lack of corpus delicti and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the "agitation subbotnik", but he received a summons obliging him to come to the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Navalny himself and another ally of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk several times shot at the guests of the event, who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been opened under article 213 (1) (Hooliganism), article 30 (3), and article 105 (2) (Attempt to kill two or more persons in a generally dangerous way out of hooliganism).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, deciding to swim, passed through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
The Ministry of energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When starting gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal around the supply of turbines produced by Siemens in the Crimea.
This was previously reported "Arguments of the week".
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against Russia expanded due to the scandal with turbines produced by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to the Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals of member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of this day, and now the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson Cuts 3,000 Jobs and Cuts Dividends to Bring Business Back to Life
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the launch of another restructuring program aimed at combating the problems faced by their business.
These job cuts, which John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut spending by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh, three civilians were also killed.
The blast is the latest to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a “human-carrying improvised explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment at the American military hospital at Bagrama airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017 in Afghanistan there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, more than 150 people were killed in a powerful explosion in the city center, the country’s deadliest terrorist attack since U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump assesses whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
The attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to postpone air pollution law after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air pollution emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called 2015 ozone measurements, stressing that this step shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states,” Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to delay ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air cleanliness standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the federal district of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that this intention is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn opposition from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that using ozone-containing air for breathing “can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the economic sanctions of the United States against Russia.
According to AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
In a statement, the AEB said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so you can not limit the principles of free trade.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit traffic on the waterfront in Pskov
Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of the state Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Trikenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this area more safe and secure.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the "Pedestrian path" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds because of cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the motorized patrol of the PPP and vigilantes.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin demanded from the investigating authorities not to withdraw hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit the investigating authorities not to remove servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to exclude the use in the interests of investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers.
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible "to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the company's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with working issues.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She said that she did not get married, did not make new tattoos, and did not name her ex-wife with the words that he ruined her life, although she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great fun.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the Harry Potter series, died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
About the death of the actor told his relatives.
According to them, he lived “a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television for 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltnam.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, he played with Laurence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy is also remembered for his recurring roles as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of Agatha Christie's screenplays of Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy has also played the role of President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something is rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, but in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparation for the celebrations, but a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, while he chided the Queen that she had never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the wife of the Queen.
The Russian foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop slandering Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In his comments, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop slandering Russia.
As the “Arguments of the Week” wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vassily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving toward hosting the most exciting boxing match in the world at up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's champion in the second half.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Broner, on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
“I used to be half-lightweight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up in the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm not big enough for 140.
I want to go down to the floor.
And he needs to go up to half-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we will have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
“Box needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he has for Lomachenko to hold his debut fight at 135 later this year to set up a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in the world championship after their fight for the title.
“The fight could be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing later willingness to fight on the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "tremendous boxer" and might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looks “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own duel.
“This fight has to happen.
No other fight brings so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will block traffic for the weekend
This weekend, 5 and 6 August, traffic will be limited in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasinsky Lane to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningradsky Prospekt, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
At all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend will be closed traffic on the Moskvoretskaya embankment.
The construction of the Zaryadye Park continues there.
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Lake Baikal for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Putin said at a meeting devoted to the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if the facts of violations are revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as people 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the testee was "probably a person 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the report stated that a person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with those of past months.
“We don’t see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely, the age of the test subject is 18 years or more.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper “Svenska Dagbladet” found that in 243 cases, people openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurement methods that are used now.
Biological age is thus defined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Guranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistaken for an adult child is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is 18 soon, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018.
This statement was a response to the request of residents of the village of Cheremushki Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions “unfounded, hypothetical reasoning.”
“So far there are no headquarters, until the establishment of headquarters is far away, before the election campaign is far away,” Peskov said.
“So far, it is not on the agenda,” Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he's moving to another party
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of service to you by remaining a Democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I’ll change my registration to Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night that "Governor Justice's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of an obstacle than a work to make our country great again."
“With just 15 governors and control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
The cat-heavyweight named Mr. Beauty found a home thanks to social networks
The cattery of the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) attached a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cattery in Facebook was published with a request to find its owner, because “it was clearly someone who had fed him before.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal’s muzzle can become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Handsome.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users noticed a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Koe praised the “sincere” apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International track and field specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports again.
Russian representative of the Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin told the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who stole gold and silver medals at the competition.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of doping funded by the state.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” Koe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
“All the council and all the congress liked it ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia’s rights,” said Coe.
“Over the next few months, we have to do everything to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made on the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was sent under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication “Journal of Zhytomyr” is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The patrol ship “Commander Borsini” entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament have accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates an order to counteract the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
Italian authorities have launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal immigrants coming to the country from Libya: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.

Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine in athletics suspended from participation in the world Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, were excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes of doping.
Povkh is a bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, a champion of Europe-2010 in the 4 by 100 meters relay, Zemlyak is the winner of the 2012 European championship in the 4 by 400 meters relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4 to 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neymar to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs, will not prevent the world record transfer of Neymar from the Spanish “Barcelona” to the French “Paris Saint-Germain”.
Any consequences can come further down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of financial fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG could definitely shell out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs, getting into huge debts in their quest for success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on clubs' debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spend money in order to improve the team and create a global brand - became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite Platini’s disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to rein in excessive spending.
“Of course, FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the purchase of Neymar’s contract at the same time, he can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual reports as costs of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to PSG, as well as to Manchester City, which belongs to Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined 60 million euros (at that rate it is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of their team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies associated with the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered legal income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG’s position.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neymar will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will grow by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Unquestionably angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would violate financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, meaning that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
“It’s all the consequences of equity and it’s completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of taking the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how the new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law was developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order of taking the oath in the law.
From the solemn oath will be released children under 18 years, as well as incapacitated, follows from the revised text of amendments to the bill "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available "Izvestia"), which the Committee on July 11 will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in the bill providing for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of article 205.2 of the criminal code), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but - only if this act is connected with terrorism.
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: when issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - having embarked on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (“United Russia”), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (“Fair Russia”) and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised once again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the registry.
Proclaim a solemn oath wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after he takes the oath, it follows from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, and not from 14.
There is a rule according to which incapacitated or disabled persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and “other persons”.
Also, in the updated bill, a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered native speakers of the Russian language to Russian citizens is prescribed.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Refusal of “foreign” citizenship, as now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate about the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text appeared clarification that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have writtenly renounced “other” citizenship and handed over the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond his control” it has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a State Duma deputy or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in “Hot American Summer” and “Comrade Detective”
The current iteration of the story nostalgically recalls both the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the grunge era in the 90s (about the time when prominent masters David Wayne and Michael Schoulter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and itself - that is, about 2001, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved to a more serious one.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
“The first day of camp” was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurdist humor (including the original story about a talking can of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who have just reached adulthood; due to this, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
“Ten years later,” where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s like “Hands rocking the cradle.”
In one episode, the character pulls out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten a reciprocation from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not parted with his virginity.
And then there is the crazy and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is involved, which is now instigated by George H.W. Bush (a travesty performed by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is stepping away from it.
It is especially funny to see forever a young Rudd, who sings a song by Matt Dillon from “Lonely”, whose character, the former big man Andy now looks like an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of a recursive series “Seven Up”, until it comes to what I think would be its logical conclusion: “Hot American Summer: twenty years later”, where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film “Hot American Summer”.
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from “Americans”, “Explosive Blonde” or even “Shine” with her images of the struggle of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, portrays a 1980s Romanian police drama about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Corneliu Street, and their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were voiced.
That's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess match as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play interestingly in "guess the voice".
But "Comrade Detective" is so clinging to the plausibility of clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not funny very often.
If it were shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of making gluttony out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs, too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia on football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that so far there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartak"- "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the owner of the Country Cup.
Two young Ufa men cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, the police turned 37-year-old Ufa, who has a furniture company.
The man said about the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The loot of thieves became tools with a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Annunciation district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, hacked the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service.
A case of theft has already been initiated against them, and the law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the lawful owner.
The state Department commented on the words of Medvedev about relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the state Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “areas for interaction”.
“Look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - replenished the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
Five new rings and three necklaces on velvet ribbons appeared in them.
In the line Rose Dior Pré Catelan released two new rings and a pendant of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds made in the technique of gliptic (manual stone carving) and esteem and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by roses, which were grown at his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
The President of the United States Donald trump made a sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
On the eve of Donald trump signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement of the President, in which he indicated that the law will not allow the United States to make profitable deals and will bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to “concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of buying the daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of a division of a Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - and became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department Alexander Novak made explanations about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck hit the power line, as a result, the Kuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts fixed the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout could be abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 in favor of keeping rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members opting for rate increases this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a 1.7% rise in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted to abandon part of a huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago due to Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he said that he now has to provide another 15 billion pounds under this plan - up to 115 billion pounds.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said, "MPC's main projections are that gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain slow in the near term, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation would require “some tightening of fiscal policy,” at a “slightly higher” rate than markets expect.
At the moment, the markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for this year and next are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left unchanged its forecast for 1.8% in 2018.
Following this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very minor wage hikes: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before falling.
The bank added that financial policy “can’t prevent” a payday in the next few years, but expects wages to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by a low pound exchange rate that offsets some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shock results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest decision on rates, there was growing noise around the expected rate hike, as inflation weighed more and more on already heavily pressured households: three members of the committee of specialists asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this drop was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end of the year.
The market looks especially favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
State Health Service to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug after a battle in the High Court over funding for the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period for about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that claimed the National Health Service had the ability to pay for PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a "major innovation" by National Health Service President Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point".
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient amount of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for a potential participation in the nearest venereal clinic taking part in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international procurement tender signed a contract to provide the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly aimed at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV will have access to a new, empowering tool in England that they can control without talking to a partner, leading to many, many better lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is quickly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have the experimental drug PrEP, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays on the part of the government.”
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk for HIV and take us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WKT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is a "positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the division of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Since July 24, 2007, the contract between Moscow and Kazan has been concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the name of the post of head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation, which has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
To get such rights, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced in order to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require IDP, and someone has enough national rights.
To be safe, drivers still get international rights, but it is worth considering that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with the forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, reports “Kommersant”, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of UGIBDD, coupons are simply not issued, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an IDP “for technical reasons”, without going into details, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: “Guess why you can’t get international rights in Moscow?”
That's right, because all departments of the traffic police have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for knowledgeable people!"
International law is urgently needed.
In Moscow, all the time hammered far ahead, on the spot coupons are not issued at all (but there is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in SPb free time until FIG.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, therefore, new forms are supplied to the units of the State Traffic Inspectorate.
This may be associated with a deficit, however, it is unclear what changes are in question, this has not been previously reported.
Blanki purchases the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IDP forms were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with First Printing Yard LLC for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold a tender in time, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are taken there, it is unclear to the end, so people are reinsured, and therefore there was a high demand for international crusts.
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Mintrans.
The new international driving license (IDP) is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge to the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Observer portal.
No self-respecting international company will not even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project are virtually non-existent," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I believe the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that were so short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch shore, the enlarging assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: its arch is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders prepared for installation on the fairway supports of the railway arch," the project's information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain fired an official who for 10 years did not go to work
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carles Recio, have?
The permanent walk lasted for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
Not his immediate boss.
There are no bureaucrats in the world.
People seem to have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the "servants of the people."
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the “sensation” came from Spain.
Carles Recio, an employee of the Valencia archive, managed to stay away from work for ten years.
He received regular pay.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
Mr. Resio’s “wonderful times” are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencian legislature.
During the investigation, it turned out that the malicious walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to be noted in the electronic system.
He immediately went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 16:00 to again note in the system that he had left.
It's been like that for 10 years.
It also became known that all the free time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Valencian legislature are thinking how to punish the immediate superior of Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to “work actively” in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are asked to protect from the presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and introduce their election.
For courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with members of the council.
At the meeting with members of the council on December 8, 2016, certain cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see “Kommersant” of December 9).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals were made, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the president of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases to judges.
To do this, experts admit, can specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman has no right to “determine the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his disciplinary proceedings, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments.”
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed to “the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to empower them for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation.”
Now all presidents of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize the appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as a basis.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use the “telephone law”.
The HRC proposes to strengthen the justices of the peace with the participation of people’s assessors to consider some “categories of civil and administrative cases”.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of a driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," said HRC member, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the instructions of the President applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the order from the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev should until September 1.
Living a high life: semi-floor and cunning design techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a pretty model house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not collect her belongings and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.”
From the moment of the first viewing, the apartment of 1000 square feet underwent a complete reconstruction.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and half-story to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architectural design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but suitable for Joan to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-floor where you could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to handle the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below. ”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the allotted space - and much more interesting.
From the half-story, through a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius, there is a view of the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with a golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Mui set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored protective panel seems to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets serve to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding up door, as in a garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” Erfan tells us about the steel-reinforced fiberboard door.
“It’s fitted with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“At the end of the day, floor space is exactly what you’re going to sell, which is what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
"Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area by using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home,” Erfan says.
No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as evidence that due to good design and increased footage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
Government approves establishment of Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant resolution is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be the development and adjustment of strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation falls to eight-year low
The growth of consumer prices in the G20 countries fell to the lowest in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the indicator is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had previously been prepared.
It allows deforestation during wildfires, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the President said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of felling “does not fall out all in a row.”
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: soldiers of the Armed Forces secretly from the command agree with the militia of Donbass
Regular telephone communication has been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbas.
Fighters of opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militia of Donbass established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
On August 4, reports "Country.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and daily communicate with them by phone.
Communication is not at all household: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, as a result of such conversations, there is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a certain officer received congratulations on his birthday from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Ukrainian Armed Forces and militiamen of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
The foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of statements of the UN security Council about the attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar fire from the terrorists of the groups “Heyat Tahrir al-Sham” (formerly “Jabhat al-Nusra”, banned in the Russian Federation) and “Faylak al-Rahman”.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the Nusra terrorist attacks should meet universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.
Let the reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the actions of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said, adding that “we would not want these barbarians to create the belief that someone in the Security Council together with them.”
Vladimir Putin called for limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
During the meeting on investment projects in the Far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of scheduled inspections, and also spoke about the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should receive the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will bring some positive results in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, Boris Titov, a business ombudsman under the President of Russia, was commissioned to conduct a survey, which revealed that in fact there was a replacement of routine inspections by unscheduled ones (the share of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 15.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens’ applications (an increase from 15% to 19.5%).

Brothers fighting for an empire of real estate worth more than $ 500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest empires in a real estate trade worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin de Lutis lives in the Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business in 2014, but the Supreme Court is still dragging a fierce dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of properties includes office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million, and Paul's - 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
Court costs are growing like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutys and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran milk bars and gastronomic shops, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family-owned jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that he doesn’t want his brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial terms of their separation.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, with a text message stating that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and flaunt our family’s name in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a resolution to the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to have dissipated.
“The judgment in our case will be delivered soon by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new chief of staff trump plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he will be first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a calmer state.
Here's what reporter Josh Dawesy says.
At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the administration on his first working day, he outlined a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president.
Kelly told employees that the information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed, trying to pacify Trump by tracking incoming information to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, resented unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that “according to six former campaign members, in order to keep under control Trump’s habit of tweeting, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant flow of praise in the information coming to him personally.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is simply ridiculous.
Maybe those campaign members know something we don’t — for example, that if it weren’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump hasn’t posted.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has been able to always keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material — reliable or not — that validates their views.
"Politician" - just for this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly give the president dubious information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Trump’s current and former employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Cathy Welsh was accused of “standing behind a series of leaks” in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then abandoned them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Welsh.
Goldmacher adds that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the secretary of staff, Rob Porter, “tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Tyumen Prosecutor’s Office is fighting against HIV-dissident
The prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which stopped the criminal case against a local resident, whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection.
According to prosecutors, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,” the prosecutor’s office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case went to the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “forgive his wife, has no complaints against her, she made amends and apologized”.
The prosecutor’s office did not agree with the court’s decision and appealed, demanding to cancel the decision to dismiss the case and send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise other HIV-dissidents will follow her example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region, about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for a year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their opinion - they allowed to diagnose, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the risks of HIV-dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and see their spread as a serious threat.
A terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people was walking a bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, told "FACTS" in the police communication sector in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he caught on the power line and instantly got electrocuted.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an "urgent".
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with body burns of 1-2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that in recent years, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, “Arguments of the week” wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, as a result of the shooting injured three people, reports the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, when there was a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be considered, since everything was closed except the eyes.
Another was given medical treatment, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill of Dolores Park is a popular destination among locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the room.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Brave New World", which became one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show, which will be the brightest in the concert history of the group.
Brave New World is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous dystopia novel by O. Huxley “Wonderful New World”.
New songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, “blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values.”
To raise money for the recording of the album, the group was helped by listeners: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planet.ru website.

Gypsies have overcome the moat and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again in conflict with determined gypsies who have overcome a moat dug by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihull Street, nicknamed "Millionaire Street".
Bringing with them horses, babies, and a host of motorhomes, they returned after being driven out no further than May, and were not prevented by a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defenses and pushed its vehicles through the site, which was left unguarded to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked Solihull's municipality, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They arrived here on Monday evening, after being chased out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.”
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and now they are back again.
More gypsies arrived last night, and perhaps more today.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don’t like that I keep paying municipal tax and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s ridiculous, we just saw these Roma leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse graze in the meadow.”
A Solihull municipality spokesman said: "We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible."
To help us gather evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the factory of champagne wines "New World"
The State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "Plant of champagne wines "New World" decided to share, transforming into JSC "Plant of champagne wines "New World", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of the Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state ownership of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of agriculture of the Crimea said that if within the next three years there is no money for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The depreciation of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise, 1.2 billion rubles are needed. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit institutions,” said Deputy head of the Ministry of agriculture of the Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its promotion and put it up for auction.
The source of “Interfax” in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investor’s investment in modernization - another $ 30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, “New World” intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the New World estate he purchased.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders defeated more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identity of citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the tombstones were damaged by unknown persons was received by the MIA of Russia in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case was opened under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, this prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is toughening its tone on NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue working unless they comply with new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minnity’s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Retett on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has only been operating for a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone now,” the organization said in a statement.
"We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now after we have collected all the information and have been able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel owned by Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with their lifeboats, which the traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing the smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is supposed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the materials of the prosecution, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in this zone, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reasons.
The code of conduct basically assumes that Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three out of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Open Embrace from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they do not entail any "significant changes or disruption" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization “Doctors Without Borders” (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and visits to Moscow were frequented by delegations of the opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it relies.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you are leading.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Douma deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Kommersant").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists and representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you manage to lead it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been approached to lead the group’s work.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotaryov Mechanics.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both on the part of Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based. - "Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "Kommersant").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya Deputy Prime Minister - "Kommersant"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to more effectively use these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five members of the contact group.
Among them there are people who have experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include in the group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one from our staff is permanently in Libya, there is no need for this yet.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed to a certain point for us as Misrata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years).
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were frightened, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what the role of Islamists is really there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you reach?
Has the Islamic State not defeated Haftar in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire, the elections reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will the agreements be broken, the fighting resume, the parties will try to seize power single-handedly?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia’s position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on this very day.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata did not believe in coincidence.
We were told: “You must be very brave people who came to us today.”
But our task is to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level easier?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it is very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates a dialogue with him.
And by the way, not just with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak excellent Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is currently under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authorities are finally elected (and now neither side has such a status), then it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the possibility that Haftar’s forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misrata and the south of the country at the same time.
And tribes in southern Libya play a big role in this issue, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about stopping the flow of migrants on the far-off approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in seeing these flows continue to flow.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical are his views?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not getting in there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft head Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I suppose to resell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
There are plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, we are talking, as in the case of Iran, about the oil-for-service scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya and not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to squeeze out terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today not a single native of Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he has about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and Russian speech there does not sound.
Which countries are these fighters from?
I wouldn’t want to go into those details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many Libyans are among the Islamist militants in Libya?
There are practically no Libyans among them, there are no more than 5%.
The rest are aliens.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks like Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and expressed their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few visits to take place, and I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Chekhov Museum, philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow Museum-Reserve "Melikhovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus of the brain and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive a special treadmill as a gift.
A useful presentation will be given to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in the Chekhov district: "I do not see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d love to get a treadmill as a gift to make my legs strong and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
And now Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-postscript" - a famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a medley of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert, the ringers of Ilya Drozdikhin's workshop, students of the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Russian Gnesin Academy, artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Chekhov Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Chekhov's memory on July 15 a single day of charity in all the Museum of the Moscow region.
30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium several times shot in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, told “FACTS” in the communication Department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe located nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had escaped by that time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shooting device that's been sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka near Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter's sentencing for reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to instigate the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, clutching her hands and lowering her eyes.
“By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his opinion, her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read out Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statements, which read: "Not a single day has passed that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy said she was haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
“To lose someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides for responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter’s message.
“You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don’t know, there are many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You only need to turn on the ignition, and you will become free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted attention with Roy's death, and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on this.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox wrote in the Los Angeles Times, “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not jail.”
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB United League 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender “Izvestia” commented on the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNICS for three seasons and in each match he showed a high level, he gave everything 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the prize more than once.
In the near future Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese “Shenzhen”, reports Eurohoops.
It is expected that the American will sign a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will become the second star of the Euroleague in July, which goes to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved to the ex-center "Panathinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
Burnt in the sun tourist from the suburbs evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygei rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from a mountainous area of the republic near Moscow tourist, who received severe sunburn.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man received burns in the campaign.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are "more intelligent ways than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have been considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of pandering to influential automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “defeat devices”, which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several leaders of the Volkswagen were convicted, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany arrested the former head of the Department of thermodynamics as part of the engine development group “Audi”.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank branch about the discovery of money received from the catering point, a suspicious bill in denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Forensic Science Center found that it was fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe who bought the shawarma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police establish persons involved in the manufacture and sale of knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade objects are advised to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a “hellish” planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so warmed by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, a year on an exoplanet lasts only 1.3 “earth” days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender began to grow worse due to dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Sches, an expert from the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provence is really under threat, because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the fall, there has been much less rain.
This affects the life span of lavender.
And there are small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them.”
A lot is at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Sches says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
So we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties more drought-resistant.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 within the framework of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games were organized with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
“It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate reports.
In the state Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said about the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to “improve bilateral cooperation”.
An example of such successful cooperation Nauert called the agreement on Syria on the truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," she said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said this, then it certainly has the right to speak, but I can’t say anything more on this subject,” she said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington declared a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions will last for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment “definitely beat” trump.
Missing bodybuilder found in a foreign country lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil was found in a foreign country in Ramenskoye.
He was found naked in his toilet.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
Identified helped the announcement of his disappearance.
Arriving on the call, doctors recorded Khanmetov's partial memory loss and traumatic brain injury, according to the public Mash.
Perhaps the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers, who kidnapped Shamil, probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, as the agency explains, occurred mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products of the projected levels.
“Difference of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at +40.2 billion rubles,” the Finance Ministry said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency on the organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
Acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The killing of the journalist underscores the fact that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodos usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crime in Sinaloa, linked to organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no proof is needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is not giving a break, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, Riodos co-founder Javier Valdés Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdés wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crime.
His absence is felt very keenly, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodos building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that depict his smile, face in glasses or his signature panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists’ killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although it is now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very silly to waste time in this seminar,” he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodos office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly spread across Culiacan.
But about Valdez almost everything is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of “calm” is just when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bochorkes, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the cartel’s rival factions, who is fighting Guzman’s sons.
The publication could anger the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, which wrote about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues have grown.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for her reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it led.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said in an October interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos employees miss Valdez, a joker who scolded like a port loader, a friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to moan alive.
They relied on the order they set up.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for the once-established order ruined him?
His death also made them question their calculations on how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you get to know their wives, their children, their legal businesses, and their underground drug-carrying airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andrés Villareal, is that "the smugness can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa — as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodos employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs that are sold exclusively to governments are used in Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers take cover in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these police officers were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials about whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of drug gangs.
In the next issue of "Riodos" counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had an exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was the favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been indicted on high-profile corruption charges.
Villareal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman’s son El Chapo escaped a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for Valdez’s column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known what had happened before,” says Villareal, 46, for his lean physique, nicknamed “El Flaco.”
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdez’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killing of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
Found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the Valdez case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her any more assignments to cover the government’s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its complicity in government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that reporters are killed not just by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services colluding with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez made a public appeal to drug cartels through an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still looking for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for publication, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer, when suddenly their phones simultaneously rang.
A series of skirmishes between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via their mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, the first page had to be redesigned.
There were sirens nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bochorkes looked at whether the police officers guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodos employees continued his work.
"How can you think of closing down," said Bohorkes, "if the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a reportage?"
Dinosaurs Use Camouflage to Avoid Enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino discovered by a Canadian miner, preserved so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It is so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown — and to say that he had, in some ways, a “dark past.”
The report, published in the journal Modern Biology, described it as "the best preserved of the Tireophores ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition stunned researchers, who call him “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous tireophore is the best preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Suncore Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed different from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was underway to detect an animal inside an earth block weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only worth squinting a little bit, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs — the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite the fact that it was covered with shell and resembled a walking tank, was apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily shelled dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaur family, was widely reported in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory technician Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective coloration, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloration is common, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the currently living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration - for example, deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and are more affordable prey, which indicates that the nodosaur had to seriously fight for survival.
“A serious predatory threat to a massive, heavily shelled dinosaur shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where it sank and laid its back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans likely spread much further inland than they are now.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable for being completely covered in preserved scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the animal’s original shape,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did back in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use the imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the tireophore could have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long, weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best preserved tireophore in the world, along with skin and shell, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the hip bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tireophore set a heavy foot on what is now Canada, until a spilled river carried it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell with precision to the smallest details.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossilized skin remains still cover the bumpy shell plates that dot the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched out along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish newspaper Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, disgraced politician found out while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The period of investigation in the case of Weinzicher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Weinziher, was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the extension of the accused house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at not less than a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "VympelCom", handed over bribes to the highest officials of the Komi Republic for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinzicher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing the Facebook feed on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It read: “Police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child and he is still lying in the middle of the street.”
Paying attention to the fact that no one else from her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user reposts in her tape with the nickname ?TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown’s lifeless body spread out in the middle of the street, where it would be four hours away.
“It’s wild,” Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put her phone down, and later that evening returned to tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled up the trigger of a rifle and yelled, “I’m going to kill you all... animals!”
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrel said at the time.
“It’s not a murder like the ones we’re used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath for color, they recalled a conversation that had been conducted countless times before this morning, "about the experiences of blacks and their situation."
She recalls saying, “Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take her," Ferrell later said.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well-versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their positions and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a disservice if I shielded her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of the final inculcation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrel and her daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little, Ferrel took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism completely changed after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Nursing Students, a national minority, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her main cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get the spotlight and wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement sparked sympathy for the project from Ferrell and six other locals with whom the Whose Streets project team had been in touch for years after Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, nobody speaks for us or with us, it’s us,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people would be represented, because that’s how I would be represented.”
Although the project’s goal was not to focus on Ferrel’s experience at all — in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the rescue leader, but about how the community unites,” Folayan said — she was the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, Whose Streets? shows Ferrel’s unexpectedly personal aspects of life, such as how she fell in love and got married to her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrel said, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do that kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel’s story again discusses and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag "BlackLivesMatter" in social networks after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” Ferrel says, “and all because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film's central character due to her distinctive features.
“She was the one who was awakening that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she was in the foreground, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, there are no movie cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that calls home, simply: “the mess.”
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran football players were disqualified for the bite of US players
El Salvador national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bitten American players.
The first was defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidore, then pinched his chest.
Then midfielder Seren, when pitching a corner in his penalty area, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Serena for six.
The meeting ended with the victory of the Americans with the score 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits with the help of DNA Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York, the faces of people hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all of them somewhat similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair trims sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing Manning’s DNA with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy-to-understand manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data — the different ways in which it is interpreted and the inferential determinism of these interpretations — but also to the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has been openly claiming to be a woman since she was a teenager, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were inaccessible, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which Manning in a platinum tint of a wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photo she began to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, isolating DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people could look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some kind of portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new press exhibition.
Chelsea was not allowed to be visited and photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote the comic book "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president will mitigate Chelsea's punishment and she will be able to visit the exhibition in person.
Obama’s decision to release Manning just days after the book’s release came as a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and powerful about the fact that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war on people revealing secret information in the government, and inventing new ways to incite hatred on Twitter, which he is called upon to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the timing of all of this, she said that "by chance nothing happens."
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature below (with a heart instead of a dot above the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencil C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist elegantly puts it), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we all are, at least in terms of our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn’t define what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is,” Dewey-Harborg said in a 2007 video.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, mastered in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in the comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
"So never shut up."
“This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote me,” says the artist greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still have chills on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as it was presciently depicted in the comics - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulators, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as well as everything at the exhibition up to the height (5", Manning's height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer searching for police on murder charges
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects due to the fact that a man stabbed to death was found in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from stab wounds, considering it a murder, while the police are intensively looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is barred from entering Northwestern University's campuses.
"Now this is a criminal case, which is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have spoken with UK police and stand ready to provide any assistance necessary to US investigative authorities.”
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are in shock and want him to surrender.
Chicago Police Liaison Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police said the crime scene was horrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was reported: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
“A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, RUSADA received the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (anti-doping Agency of Great Britain).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA’s work and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list, implies that the Russian andidoping structures should publicly recognize the results of the investigation conducted by order of WADA Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Absolutely no one is going to accept this report,” added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to resume its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, extinguished, reports Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire adjacent to the skyscraper, the streets were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that Dubai is burning 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unimagined outfit Buzova shocked fans: pants that do not cover the underpants
Scandalous host of the reality show "House-2" Olga Buzova struck the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live dancing in his underwear.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the new singer duet with Nastya Kudri performed the song "We will be hot."
Both girls took the stage in provocative "pants", sewn in such a way that the singer's underwear was in sight.
On the trousers were written Buzov and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that the changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, August 4, reported the news service “Radio 4” with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilising in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress.
The Yekaterinburg metro is developing a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay by bank card, said the General Director of OAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for travel in the metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, could use the subway with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another “Uber”
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs San Francisco-based 75-person company Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in the hair care industry.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with staff, which help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to make express surveys, reach out to certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact the directorate directly.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another “Uber”, which was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to estimates of the online portal “Let’s talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global governance, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion dollars.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber’s declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made opinion polls to staff, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that a company mistreats employees or behaves unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are up-to-date with the rules and procedures and to offer an easy way to reach out to the company’s head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or head office email, file a formal complaint, and hope to be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay — can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who leads the network’s risk management group Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take employee ethics, values, and engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Affair.
But it wasn’t until “social media went viral” that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty underwear from spreading virally online.
“Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture capitalists, who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work at a company, feel heard, and that the work they do produces results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when businesses in their portfolio do well; businesses do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if change doesn’t come quickly enough, or doesn’t come at all, frustration can develop and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, employees will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high staff turnover.
“If you’re not trying to create a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul opened a new asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where twice there were pits on the recently asphalted roadway (intersection with the street Youth), it was decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land subsided in the area of the ownerless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee for Road Management, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on the outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work out longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled up their T-shirts, exposing their backs, brilliant with sweat after a tense first day of a sports camp.
For many players of the team, these moments of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will travel back to the dorms after three hours of training to prepare for the final exams, and return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the next morning.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for players, actually lengthened their working day - at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team at the University of California at Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm, so that they fit into the already dense schedule of players.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day has been a larger number of days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of the camp by almost a week compared to last year and training during summer school for the first time in Moray's six seasons at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before officially preparing for the first game of the season against the Texas A&M University team in September.
Mora said he supports the rule change by the National Student Sports Association, despite having another point in the players' tight schedule because of it.
“For three or four days, we’re giving them this huge burden, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just overcame it, they work, they’re wonderful guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California at Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in line of sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that have crossed the defensive net behind the goal.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a training video, this is very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg released from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in the subway of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
We will remind, the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
We will remind, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the subway of St. Petersburg to review the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany ahead of the September elections have expressed support for a plan to fine social networks if they do not promptly remove hateful posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news feed manager, wrote in her blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the feature of “related articles” and work on other changes to the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a comic book novel: One lock in English history
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scottie was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the river Bull in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a spear of hair and a penchant for historical documents, for a comic novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
Castle in England spans from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells the story of families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn’t Rhodes’ first book based on archival data: In 2014, he wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents that unexpectedly touched him to his core.
“I could have been touched simply by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days for lighting lit the fire.
And after 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!
For a man so obsessed with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the English Arts Council and living in the castle for four months ("Honestly, I'm a little bit queer there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, went through the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, hyena heads on walls or bottles, centuries lying in a ditch.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty Castle is not much studied because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to sort out the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been dumping in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says, “but this is what two families fought for.
It happens, guys!”
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in a book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
“The peasant revolt started in these places, and I thought that the revolt was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are strongly connected with the history of the castle - for example, "Priest", which tells about a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the coffin (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of all who inhabited Scottie: "Gentlemen seem to have been perfect scammers, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys who know how to care for the heirs of big fortunes.
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamyanmyaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like, ‘Damn, I have to go back to real life again.’
15 of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that have left the ARB will be at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all banks that announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify revoking licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many leaders of the fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having expressed disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the Association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB will be at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out."
Contributors are better.
How's it going to end?
Answer immediately to the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors do not threaten anything, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in all matters relating to the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued at the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of “regionals”.
In terms of personnel and organization, it is obvious that there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - the organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It can not be said that the Association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may want too much"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day, representatives of banks that have left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our Association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both parties are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that “the chair does not hold”, called possible the new head of the renewed Association “Russia” Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Rossiya Association Council, where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Russia.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine to major cities of Russia will not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And then the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I don’t think we’re technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
That’s the catchphrase at the level of slogans: let’s ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will the whole city be closed?
“In 20 years, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” the prime minister said.
Earlier, the newspaper “Izvestia” reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport submitted to the government by the CEO of KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with ICE in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have cash resources that allow them to support themselves, and possess skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
Before we had time to think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was released.
Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we’ll see a lot more of them soon,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin warm to the touch, and almost human cues driven by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot’s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality", in comparison with which Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive, is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the qualities they find attractive in robots, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of being shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," the True Companion website said.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be "in the mood"!"
There is a lot to worry about in the emergence of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the most troubling is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape, which is caused by mastering the Cold (read: resisting) Farah.
On the True Companion website, Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came at a time when women’s rights around the world are at risk when there’s a president in the White House who boasts of molesting women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphic images, twisted bodies and slanted eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn’t seem that big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" robots do not look like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the portal BeBasket by the general manager of “blue-yellow” Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place at the EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, at which the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine since leaving the post of head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
The wards of Evgeny Murzin in group B will have five fights: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men’s team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's big move?
To pretend to be Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, a common place was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
Looks like we're all so tense we're gonna burst.
There is less talk about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I’m writing about it because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who has long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she’s been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
Over dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I cannot help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly seem a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing out on Mitt Romney’s old-fashioned madness today — with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) — compared to Trump, both seem like very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks household and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals who, bent, look at their backs in horror - extremely sinister, and ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: views from skyscrapers are becoming obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too boring to cause trepidation, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still going through the day when I learned that the area of the Swiss cottage is not really a Swiss chalet (themed pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” does not count), but a large roundabout in North London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years old, a child of eleven years old and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could score a carousel, I would score a five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before I took the card to the terminal.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is still the same plus the option to accompany the tip estimate of 15 percent is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only slows down neutral in idea interaction, but also has to make a personal attitude in a situation that does not assume it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled confoundedly as I tired of judging my five-star credit card experience.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steencamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office said it would file another protest, this time against Pretorius’ six-year sentence, which it said was too soft.
The Attorney General’s Office said it would appeal to South Africa’s Supreme Court and the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretorius’ term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor’s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV elected a subscription not to leave
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a no-departure subscription for a man who committed an attack on the journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razvozhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
“As part of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“beatings”) against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen as a preventive measure in the form of a non-departure subscription and proper behavior,” Volk said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast to the Day of Airborne Troops, a drunk man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with VDV.
According to Razvozhayev, paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught parking in a non-prescribed area.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Russian foreign Ministry accused the Vice-President of the United States in the rhetoric of the cold war
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is with regret that we have to state that Washington is increasingly sliding towards the primitive ideological clichés of the Cold War era, which are completely divorced from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West, or with Russia” and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the allegedly unalternative accession of the whole of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to alienate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop slandering Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today at about 08:10 MSK there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region said.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers are working, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, a local resident reported to the Police Department that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors left for the scene, who promptly delivered the child to a medical institution," the Odessa police headquarters said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the pregnant woman was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also established that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the head office, in the field of attention of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously been and on special account was not.
At present, the police establish the circumstances and the reasons that forced the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby in the garbage.
Grigory Leps: "I'm rushing into battle, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps next Sunday will celebrate its 55th anniversary.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the observer of “Izvestia”.
I remember how your "half-year-old" was celebrated.
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have figured out how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Have the plans come true?
Speaking of work, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same now as, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
I'm still fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think, going to a different level.
With them you record a new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles for mixing.
It's called "What are you so serious about?" from the song of the same name, which was written together with Timothy.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't laid it out yet.
We'll do it later when we shoot the clip.
And the album will be presented in November - to the series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record has a great American drummer Chris Coleman on it.
You seem to have wanted him on your touring roster, too?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio and recorded his parts.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from ? 35 thousand to ? 45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed them.
Sometimes I want to fight with one of them, and not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
About him write Western music magazines, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to his performance, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performing technique."
Your album comes together in Los Angeles, American musicians work with you, but you yourself still can not come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift the ban?
To be honest, I am not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I’m really sorry I can’t get to America.
I’ve said many times that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years did not set the tasks that American musicians always solved.
They wanted the best possible sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
For some reason, the UK refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year so that I can go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And already in August you have a concert in Monaco, not a commissioned one, but a billboard, right?
Yes, there is a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I have already performed there once.
Now they are invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikule Rendezvous, which starts on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After the tour and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Do you want to record an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song?
He said, "Gregory, I write songs so they can be performed."
Please try and sing.
It’s interesting to record an album like this.
So far, I do not have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
Unless you focus entirely on your production center.
I assume you haven't realized his potential yet, signed all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, successful people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the “Voice”.
We signed a contract with him and we work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertory, I'm making clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, pay poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
At the end, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them will achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I will not block oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to do a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, according to my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what bloggers and critics think of me.
I am truly sorry that this situation has turned out with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and should be together.
I’m sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And earlier I gave 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is sincerely regrettable that now they cannot fully throw out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would like to invite some cool Ukrainian singer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But I think that's unlikely at the moment...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical director of the Vostochny Cosmodrome Andrei Okhlopkov began work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SCNPC).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Exploitation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Phillies, where he will coordinate production.
There will be no replacement for Mr. Okhlopkov: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is scattered throughout the divisions of CENKI.
The fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy general director of CENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov went to work in the Khrunichev State Research and Production Center, "Kommersant" told top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
“He has been working at the new post for several weeks,” Kommersant’s interlocutors in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of Director of production coordination, - said the company. - Andrey Okhlopkov assigned to him the task of ensuring the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome fully completed.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular, at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, with his filing, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities for technological development assigned to him at CENKI were extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with Kommersant that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the terms were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go on a trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer occurred (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “space Susanin”, but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov also remembered the directness: for example, in an interview with "Kommersant", he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer in the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex scheduled for the fourth quarter.
According to "Kommersant", the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work were disagreements with the management of CENKI regarding the ways of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be spread out over the divisions of CENKI.
In music schools there will be a program of teaching two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this it is possible to re-read repetitive disciplines to students, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes in the second specialty is solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Non-Child Talk” with the pupils of the Sirius Children’s Center, Maria Andreeva, a student, said that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The head of state acknowledged her question is very relevant and promised to help.
17-year-old Russian man arrested in Mexico
In Mexico, detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office buildings complex and climbed on his own to one of his towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security dropped him to the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the web.
Users called the young man "Spider-Man".
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the gut make sure that the harmful microbes coming from the food do not enter the body.
Cells that can trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed towards inflammation, this can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestines appear to increase the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of protein — to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan in mice, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice's gut cells was sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found to be present in mice that had immune cells but were not present in mice that did not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid — without bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease have been found to have defects in the genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, since inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired a “genius” in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who was acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke ahead when they pleased.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho says needs to be finalized before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius is in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Just like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviv Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main lineup by the start of the following season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a great job for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democratic leaders urge them to stay in ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Sejm from Social Democrats Cheslovas Jurshenas appealed to fellow party members to stay in the ruling coalition.
As reported by “Parliament newspaper”, due to friction with partners — the Union of peasants and “green” — in the Social Democratic party initiated a discussion whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here three senior experienced comrades addressed to fellow party members with an open letter, in which, in particular, it is clear that the disappointment of the party comrades with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided for in the government program, and for maintaining the political dominance of the left center over the right parties.
According to the former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far, “emotionally based expression of opinion has prevailed without specific arguments.”
The authors of the letter fear that the rash actions of their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court reduced the sentence of wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazev court, the convict was released from jail.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motor scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court in its decision reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," spokeswoman of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova said.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaev’s health, the actual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant to Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the offense and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed in the court’s decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out an appeal against the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles., to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony (under Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from prison by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
Onf will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the “frontline” plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of “Izvestia” in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain “deep analysis” on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, the interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the movement’s Central Staff, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the frontline fighters will report to the head of state on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Forum of Action” of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the past year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “frontline” will report on the work on the priority projects of the ONF,” Olga Timofeeva told “Izvestia”.
According to her, a special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already participated in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - Olga Timofeeva added.
The head of the laboratory of regional policy of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI), Andrei Kolyadin, noted: raising environmental issues, the ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, - said "Izvestia" Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that today the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for solving their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open coal transshipment in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further law enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity fund "Ecology for All".
Sergei Tsyplenkov, a member of the HRC and head of Greenpeace Russia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary for successful solution of environmental problems, legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for businesses.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and car by hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now, through his firm BioTec, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at King's in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a price of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House Requisition Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials inspected technology products from all fifty states.
A Connecticut-made helicopter was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter control, the White House Military Administration ordered the helicopter's presence in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you’re aware because this is an unusual widely publicized event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his boss, the Marine Corps’ first deputy chief of aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be needed for the return flight in accordance with restrictions on working hours.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicted this ruling.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch’s law and we were told it wasn’t,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” replied the deputy chief.
“Made in America” was announced by the White House as an official event, and Hatch’s law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote health care reform, which was then in the works in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to request them only in the interests of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of debate in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the ‘Made in America’ show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House to within an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 had 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the event "Made in America" was credited to the crew for the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Defense Department’s 2017 fiscal year hourly rates, the Defense Department’s reimbursement rate for VH-3Ds is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit's records state that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base airfield at Quantico Marine Corps Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on the approximate reimbursement rate is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other non-recoverable costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump had interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he certainly sat at the driver’s seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said.
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Annually, Life Saving grants will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care departments of the capital’s medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of gratitude to the orthopedic traumatologist Viktor Protsko, under whose leadership a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the teenager’s foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants annually to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive care and hospital, there are day departments.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area, occupying the medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term stay hospitals (SCP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the terms of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, hospital care was provided to 36,000 patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from Viktor Prokopeni, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, to coordinate the indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU has not been received," the report said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overstated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
This year’s election marks the first time power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, increased fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and 25 euros for garbage.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" on social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the greatest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the adviser on tourism of Venice Paola Mar, information about fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of violators, in order to warn their compatriots from such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit tourist flow.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.

The Federation Council dismissed Ozerov from the post of head of the Committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on defense and security Viktor Ozerov and released him from this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
A request to dismiss him from his position Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Viktor Ozerov has been representing the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Defense and Security Committee has been chaired by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Power Market and the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (Capacity) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (as of July 17, 2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have been beating the thresholds of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on Angara, flowing from Lake Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year began the movement.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of wholesale market price zones, for which the features of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of new tariff changes downwards for Buryatia.

National Union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at the factory McVitie's in Glasgow
The union is seeking assurances from McVitie's biscuit maker's managers over its long-term production commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company went silent on the issue of future investment in the Tolkros facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, cookies Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the object, employees and representatives of the trade union “will learn about them first.”
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded from McVitie's reaction to the concern that funding would not be used to modernize production lines.
Drew Duffy, senior organizer, said: “Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the CEO of the business needs and investment plan facility regarding the future of Tolcross.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and amid Brexit, rising living wage and chronic production decline, Glasgow’s East End desperately needs the prosperity of manufacturing at McVitie’s factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolkros facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to our employees about the fact that like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolkros facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the question of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNKhK) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNKhK jeopardizes the implementation of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are continuing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
The member of “La Liga” may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record raid that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer enlivened the summer transfer window when Ligue 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transfer, more than twice the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds per week net.
It is known that Barcelona are furious with how the proposal was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of such a possibility three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG's best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will come against them, we will make offers to their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let go of the Italian player on any terms, and now probably Barcelona feels the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.

"I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyailo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FSBI Glavrybvod Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about cleaning up the lake.
Then the fry were shown in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin let a few fry out of the sack.
Then pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on Olkhon Island.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is allegedly provided.
“I want to understand what is actually happening there with funding,” the Russian leader stressed.
We will remind, during the forest fires of 2017 fire were covered settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, were destroyed residential buildings and outbuildings.
