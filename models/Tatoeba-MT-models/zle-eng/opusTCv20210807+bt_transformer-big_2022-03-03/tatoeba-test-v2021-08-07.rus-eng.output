White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - mat! In chess circles, this is jokingly called "foolish mat".
White: rooks on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White puts the opponent in the position of zugzwang, putting the rook on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the rook on a6 or move the elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h.
