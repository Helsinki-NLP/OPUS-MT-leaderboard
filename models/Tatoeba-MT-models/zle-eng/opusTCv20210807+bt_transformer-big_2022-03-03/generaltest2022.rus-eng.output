From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same women of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: the medium-rigid surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the “wave” or “hamak” effect.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to allocate breathing materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Due to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and pollution is entrusted to a removable case made of jacquard, supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in a pair to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the parties - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests in the house of my parents.
Guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove are still toasted, the mother exfoliated houses the floor.
Oh, my God, I couldn't sit at the table.
And then wash the dishes again, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are good, and the cake is definitely with them.
I don’t like the holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table to a minimum.
And I cook them goodies, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Is Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with omicron-strain," BioNTech and Pfizer said.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not only for throwing.
These vibes have a greater relative weight than those of similar counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is an upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in the shade, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, up-and-down movements with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching a pike and a large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive bait feeding is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing pond trout.
To satisfy her vagaries, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game is able to irritate the passive pike, which does not react even to the live one.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with a line and braided cords even of large diameters.
For catching pike, pike, ersh or perch, except for uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with "cheeking" on the bottom.
If you are catching in a tight spot, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with the same success both on relatively small and on rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu said.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to media reports, "Wagner" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not on the form lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the European Council on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 at least to February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held in time are rapidly reduced,” the article notes.
Against this background, the Supreme Election Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see in the foreign policy of the country more success than failure, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored peace there", "the decision on the" Nord stream-2 "," the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons "," Crimea we pushed away. "
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of paperwork and the transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the crown prince of the emirate, chairman of Dubai's executive board, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document management in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, saved 336 million sheets of paper, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry indicators for 11 months were worse than last year’s result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if at the end of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed a positive trend to last year, then at the end of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a delay in credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the Kazinform correspondent reports.
“According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, this year in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 “On approval of the Procedure for granting deferred payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses” was adopted,” Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of loan payments provided for the provision of banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities, deferment of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain of "ocmyron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "ocmyron" can be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that “ocmyron” originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, with a mutation, he did not encounter any resistance to immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmyron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So it happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people die 30-year-olds, and 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze carry it.
The immune response is rabid in a young man, he is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with your finger, he beats like a gun on sparrows, "concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all the hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - it's temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by the covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as pupils of kindergartens,” Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT, told Moskva 24.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of the covid
The authors examined the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can contract the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from the covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Goloseikin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by addictions - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State University of Economics.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive disorders department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova told about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt Returns Nearly 30,000 Illegally Exported Artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to their homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on Al-Hayat TV channel Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian government has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad said that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
The department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Auction house Christie's on July 4 held auctions, at which the bust of more than 3 thousand years was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported from the country at different times monuments of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological surveys of “black diggers”.
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of employees
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline by which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly life of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside any literary associations, he parted with imaginism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, at times we strongly criticize critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to wear it on their hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle “Persian motifs” was completed, the poem “Anna Snegina” was written, 8 books were published, the collection “Rus Sovetskaya” was published.
And the main success - at the end of June of the 25th year Gosizdat signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets such honor was not awarded, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip the family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life is getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare from the poem “Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin’s death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where that pain came from.
Is the wind blowing?
Over an empty and uninhabited field,
Like a grove in September,
It brainwashes alcohol.
Many friends noted that Yesenin strongly passed, looks bad, obviously sick.
Increasingly, there are repeated twitches, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, there are no reliable documents.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan was recovering in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet’s drunkenness, scandals on this ground, and the reasons for the police are scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet’s terrible romance with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good incomes, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
The Elders remember:
“I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on a stairwell.
Falling, scratched his face and wheezing.
Having recovered a little, he constantly began to cough, sprinkled all the blood on the sheet.
Yes, and Yesenin himself after a voyage to Europe and the United States (in the States then there was a dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there except the streets and the pubs.
At the end of the day, I stopped remembering people.
And I drank, of course.
I drank because I was thirsty.”

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as ‘weapons’
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The corresponding statement of the Deputy foreign Minister made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he “is actively looking for new ways.”
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons “in many parts of the world.”
According to the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a joke
The 2021 social events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film “No Time to Die,” he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional “bond” butterfly.
His example was twice followed by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket to the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried on myself and Lionel the Messiah.
The player came to pick up the seventh “Golden ball” in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is Gucci, in which he appeared on one of the premieres of the film “House Gucci” Ambassador brand Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weave threads, a dense fabric is obtained with a worrisome external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
“Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Vakhoshkin. - It is suitable for those cases, if the invitation indicates the dress code “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie”.
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with a lot of money, - say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beauty Brammell". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate and the appearance in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate party, but if we are talking about "the leader of those who run this event, then - yes, he has such a thing in the subject."
If the employee is lower in rank, and his goal is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not according to the Senka hat," the editors of the Telegram channel say about men's fashion.
Very mixed feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre that pulls so hard.
And it is not associated with the pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don’t understand the admiration of others.
With all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid.
Billions of investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also not in circulation - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
It's dripping.
Then who's in the flyby?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.

I haven’t seen a single beautiful person in the photo.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not sit down, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful people", but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months may protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, given the appearance of a new strain, “a very long period.”
"Under the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, urging in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to revaccinate.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and ill, then he received “hybrid immunity”, that is, antibodies are many and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
The “Big seven” warned Russia of “massive consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly,” but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement said.
Further, the ministers call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” which US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier this afternoon, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine found 32 times less effective against omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the amicron variety,” said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease in case of infection with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the effect of micron-strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that amicron strain can cause a new wave of viral circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the defense Ministry of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrey Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin the supply of weapons under Chancellor Scholze.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation” of part of Ukrainian territory by Russia.
The same “illogical” position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will keep under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the President added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses in the fall of bank card data into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend to have a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and the money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safer Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the differences.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress they had reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine’s border, a position that G7 officials confirmed on Sunday.

Who found money in the wall of the church plumbing will pay 20 thousand dollars
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid the reward.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that pious Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that occurred in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then disappeared about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks that were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated $ 5,000 for the award and later received another $ 20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
That’s why her attitude is so negative.
And it’s not that “she is financially much richer than all the writers”, as they say here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves so brazenly, so defiantly, like this madam.

Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to comply with a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection against COVID-19 is revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injection and the use of nasal vaccine.
With internal use, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. With the introduction of the vaccine, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside after vaccination, we most of all form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on dual vaccination,” he said.
The chief prophylactic UrFO, doctor of medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination together with injectable is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to a male (died long ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, a cord, affection, love and games for a leaky bitch, then go ahead.
But Pessel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners so they wouldn’t run after the dog, although they lamented that out, 200 thousand run away (poms), straight took her hand and took her to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests of opponents of vaccinations do not stop
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against the covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards that read “This is a false pandemic,” “I won’t get vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of several regions of the country was taken against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of protesters threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began to study earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve that title.
Here is just one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans suffered only death and looting of any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that a new strain of coronavirus has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the spread of a new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain was detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, can bypass the degree of spread of the delta strain, it is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “omicron” in the coming months will displace the “delta”.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom sick a few hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain of “omicron”, and at the peak of the hospital will take more than 2 thousand people daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain of "omicron" is 32 times lower in comparison with other types of the disease.
About how to react to the “omicron” of the Russian “Satellite V” is still unknown — it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on a strain of “omicron”.

At that time, people believed in God more honestly than they do today.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communication tools are dipfake.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real records with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfake, attackers can call friends of the victim via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for sending for blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I put emphasis on the fact that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much to be painted and walk in short skirts, show stockings and pantyhose on legs.
It's a province, but there's such a thing in the store.
In large cities and Muslim women were painted, and spoons were shown.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, and the same cosmetics are not.
Listed five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the “migraine of the weekend” among workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in health over the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after workdays is often a “weekend migraine”, said a famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, especially often suffer from this workaholics, which on the weekend there is a headache, weakness and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
Our lives change dramatically over the weekend.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more, and drink less, - the doctor argued. - Due to lack of coffee, a small breakout begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness. "
Late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then a reaction will occur, which is called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to follow what changes the most on the weekend.

South African scientists claim low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
In South Africa, stated the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against “omicron”
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron-strain coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of “omicron”) corresponds to the (level) of effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts specified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
According to him, Germany by 2045 plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
“In 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they recorded Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the Minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline “does not meet the requirements” of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers have hacked Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi’s office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister’s page has already been hacked in 2020 and urged to make donations to the fund with the help of cryptocurrency.
In New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France voted 3.51% (2,755 people) voted, while 96.49% (75,762) voted “against”.
The turnout was 43.90%, in total, more than 80,000 New Caledonians took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt,” as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they will not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonian independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” Eric Zemmur repeated many times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be the choice of France."

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “stand united against Russia.”
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
“There is quite a lot of false information in this article,” a comment from one of the readers leads RIA Novosti.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of North-Kurilsk.
The area lies at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce a new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by the freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the body and the like,” he said.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it “in all respects”.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward.”
At the airport, two lions escaped from the container.
Lions escaped at Singapore’s Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized lions with the help of darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Beth Kitchin, a nutritionist at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid milk flakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is found in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75,000 people may die by April due to omicron strain
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omikron strain of coronavirus in the next five months in England can die up to 75 thousand people, if not to tighten restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the strain of omycrone will be recorded in the country, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from overburdening if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot rule out infection,” said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of spread of omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the strain of omicron may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
So far, 1,898 cases of coronavirus infection have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid indicated that in reality this figure can already reach 10 thousand cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn’t been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape from a pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted on the buzz.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of travel to space, life on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling for governments to act and proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have feed lengths above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
On the yacht there is a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, sites for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the wrestler McGregor - a platform for martial arts.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic value when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet’s biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail hid on his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, as Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for 50-meter vessels.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
This writes the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study shows that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or write poetry, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “negotiate” about Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “join anywhere.”
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a bidding,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be detected and deployed by the counter-forces," he said.
China boosts development of rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said a representative of the company Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. launched the first two-storey high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s rail equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of China’s International Trade Promotion Committee.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary tools and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist Lists Early Signs of Dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semyon Golosheikin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
Signs of future dementia, he said, could be forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and reduced levels of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for it, the specialist said.
Goloseikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help to reduce the risk of dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” said Golosheikin.
Earlier, the charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition where a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the medical council established under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character,” the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials disciplined him.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to its former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia held a protest against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the Agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife.
Many protesters came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their poster, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a medical ward from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and planes.

The steep rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taivu in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, that is still a long way off.
Games organiser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the infrastructure necessary for recreation there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals suffers from unemployment.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes open catering points with dishes of national cuisine.
Taivu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China seeks to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress towards universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and WHO have published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have almost no social support.

Taiwan's minister cut off from Summit for Democracy broadcast at White House request
The speech of the Minister of digital technologies of Taiwan Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the organized by the United States “Summit for democracy” was transferred to the mode without video, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which was shown by Ms. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world on the degree of ensuring civil rights.
Taiwan was designated green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
The PRC was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the policy of “one China”, which Washington adheres to.
One of the sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money extracted through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge.”

The foreign Ministry spoke about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have made with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist Warns of Risk of Vaccination with COVID Nasal Drug Outside Hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the one vaccinated with nasal congestion faints after injection.

During the day in the UK, 1239 cases of infection with a new coronavirus omicron strain were identified.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the strain “omicron” were recorded in England, 38 people became ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” into the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov says that “everyone in the world understands this.”
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to withdraw from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Supported independence from France, 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
The voting rate on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own territory.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration whereby the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO says 'omicron' is less dangerous than 'delta'
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminary believes that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the case of a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, “Omicron” is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein strain "omicron" suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("heaviness of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in the "delta", - the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of infection with “omicron” in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the delta.
In Russia, two cases of infection with omicron-strain have been registered.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and, perhaps, will make compromises on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal “Glavred”.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with key FPG (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.),” the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissenting groups with Zelensky and the President, which is likely to seize control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can lead to an event that will be a major shock to society.
“The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
Such an option for the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-MP believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey data of the sociological group “Rating” showed that the rating of the Ukrainian President fell to record low values, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest rate since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine for Zelensky would vote only 21.8%, while for the former President of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action on Red Square poet: "For the quote Evtushenko 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag "Poetvrossiyamorepoet".
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and there is also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, detention as much as possible, polite, no matter how funny it sounded in some context of the word.
On Pushkin took OMON and took hard.
They asked me about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all four sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag they begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless uses the help of an interpreter.
And also at official events, a transcript is kept in the old way by an author, and a stenographer does not have to know several languages.

In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issue of “Yandex”
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites of the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, Director General of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series “The Squid Game” and “Tenderness” directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service ivi in Russia (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the issue of search engines, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of TNT (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only revised the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimaite, size 160х190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces that are different in softness - high rigidity and a little more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage".
This means that the sleeping space has 2000 spirals, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of the entire variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: at the top and bottom of the springs, combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of a classic, since it conveys not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties of the mattress.
If the coir provides the correct support for the back, then the latex gives the adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in an easy-to-wear knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam, which is used in the mattress, is certified by CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but probably Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If different, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Paiusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend is to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to the digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional Olivier and a herring under the fur coat, but no one forces me to eat everything at once.
You can eat on a spoon, try - and enough.
After all, there are really ten days off, you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turn.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the rise in commodity prices was temporary or not.
Even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived its usefulness” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O’Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O’Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department “Opening Investments” Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions of this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai, it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger rise in price.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands grew not so much: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz has a good sales growth and a weighted average price at the same time - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth of financial capacity,” explained the general director of NAPI Tatiana Arabaji.
In terms of sales growth, fantastic figures are shown by Chinese brands, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
According to the dynamics of income growth, the Russian Lada shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year in financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all in minus - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, covering the entire world automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recoup past losses, experts say.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think many automakers have even been able to shift some of the costs of past periods onto consumers, which they could not put into the price of cars before.
says the analyst of VTB Capital on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars grow faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With increasing supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income from volumes, says independent consultant for the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are seeking to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Bourgasliev.
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is also heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars were a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion by Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a “invasion” by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There has never been such a plan,” the White House chief of staff said when asked if the United States had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory.”
I immediately leave these interviews.
If at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and another cup of washing, it is terrible to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an eyeliner layer, where you immediately talk to the leader.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an “employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” or another power structure, then it is ineffective to immediately drop it, and it is likely not to have time to put it on the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lies about involvement in law enforcement, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need better advice for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe that was the case.
They don’t know who to blame anymore.
We got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the most ...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.

As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of the question.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KAMAZ.
