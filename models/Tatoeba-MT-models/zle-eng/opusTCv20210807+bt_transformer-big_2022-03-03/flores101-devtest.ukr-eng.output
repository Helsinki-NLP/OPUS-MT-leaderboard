This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reports details that could not provide fossils — for example, color and three-dimensional image.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with the lower part of a pale or carotenoid color.
The discovery also provides insight into feather evolution in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed rod called a rachis, but there are other features of the feathers — toothed and bearded — the researchers concluded that the rachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
From the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for beauty. Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample shows adult plumage, and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits adult plumage rather than the plumage of a cub.
Last morning, a car bomb detonated outside a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

In France, voting traditionally does not involve the use of high technology: voters go one to the booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper on which their candidate is indicated.
After officials have identified the voter, he lowers the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature on the voter list.
The electoral legislation of France quite stringently encrypts the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes there at the beginning of voting, and no envelopes are added except those that are thrown in by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, with observance of certain procedures.

In the second run of the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's sitting group with a total time of 4:41.30 - 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Lesch, who finished in first place and at 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian Jiyonji Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of all 117 skiers did not take a single seat in the super giant slalom race.
Madhya Pradesh police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her a stolen mobile phone and laptop.”
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared before the court with his face closed.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into him, none of these people were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency responders rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to the Addenbrooke Clinic in Cambridge.
Adekoya went to the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody and awaiting charges and trial, but the testimony of any witness can be denied because her photo was often published.
In other provinces of the UK, this is common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that “journalists are obviously turning to a dangerous path by distributing photos and other data of suspects.”
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters it would not provide any further comments, at least until the indictment was issued.
This document, according to the leaked information, will refer to the conflict around the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of the borders that existed before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics covered probably include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be carefully monitored by rangers, as hunting was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with UNODC and the Sports Archers Association of Australia (ACCA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Hunting Program of the Sports Archers Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NSPDP, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received proper safety instructions and were trained.
Yesterday, Martelly took an oath in the new Provisional Electoral Council (ITR), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVK, as part of a package of measures to move the country towards a new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by electoral failure, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METP) said it was aware of 27 emergencies related to these devices.
Last week, METP announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple’s delay with the report “a great shame.”
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (at 09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot down tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages managed to be rescued. At least six hostages are now reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady, because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's path and pursued a medical career.
He was educated as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took a job at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby’s lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators seized two flight recorders (black boxes).
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Quite unique as she herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldisth" Rannels commented, "The moon was as wild as I was...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people who took part in the survey share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
If we consider the categorical answers to the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and take part in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but, due to his complaints, there were doubts about his physical form.
He could not take painkillers, because they are prohibited during participation in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software by the beginning of February, and this was reported on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source of water supply to Earth, as well as organic substances capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets have long collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year, and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political talk and stupidity."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, on the contrary, more outdated ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport will be started and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and intercept parking will not be available on the surface.
Fears due to the lack of transportation forced us to think about playing behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, reported the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer due to the reproduction of Darwin's endemic finches, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finches, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be given a variety of forms. It can be folded into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and weaved. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. The indicator can be created using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rotating them in a vessel, and then replace them with a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will provide unusual sensations and form something like a shell.
The toilet, connected to a complex sewer network, was in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed companies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts the light and what we see.
You need a healthy rocket at least 100 feet high to deliver a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most that the wheel has done for us has made it possible to transport much easier and faster.
It gave us trains, cars and many other vehicles.
Below is a larger number of medium-sized cats that feed on average prey - from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that prey on numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of the niche - the special position that each cat occupies and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called prairies.
The prairie includes from one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion walkers largely behave like packs of wolves or dogs — animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) behavior, and are just as dangerous to their prey.
The tiger, as a comprehensively developed athlete, can fight up (although not very skillfully), swim, jump for a long distance, and also beat five times stronger than a man's bow.
Tigers belong to the same group (Panther genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not look like a full-voice roar of a lion, rather a confused cry.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that are hunted by an ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots chase and track animals that are hunted by smell, looking for their smell on the ground.
Thanks to night vision, they see very well in the dark, and also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt for their prey, hiding in the surrounding environment, and then suddenly jump out for their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, if they cross a mountain ridge or river, or if they cross to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
In this new environment, other resources and other rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger opponent than it was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all - they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, that is, the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which a person breathes, and absorb carbon dioxide, which a person removes from the body (i.e. exhales).
Plants prepare food from the sun with photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we consume is plants.
Mosasaurus was a predator of the highest order of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except for other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws were strewn with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along with their extra set on the palate, which meant that no one who stood in his way would be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but maybe he had a split tongue. He had turtles in his diet, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tirex would not be able to compare with him.
Mostly the Romans fed on what is familiar to us, but they had their own strange and unusual feast treats, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a rodent called a wolf.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate, sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to arrange joint banquets, where during the meal they rested, lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include products imported to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a central temple, which was considered the home of this god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
In each temple there was a temple courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids were built, which were parts of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were ordinary open counters that went outside. Houses were built of stones.
Canaan had no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was rarely inhabited. The ancient Norse sagas say that Eric Rudy was expelled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve watched the movie Treasure of a Nation, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Despite the fact that something is really written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document and upside down.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it is 293x4 by 241x2 inches) was kept in a folded state.
Thus, it is likely that the entry was added simply as a tag.
As a result of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy. They were the French, who concluded a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, and this landing was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the fighting forces of France liberated the south of France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, that is, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civil", which refers to the Latin word "civis", which means "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and this also determines the size of society in a certain way.
Cities-states can be considered the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge for several generations, a sustainable cultural trace and uniform distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving no meaningful historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government — Congress was its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and because of the lack of national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities who often did not cooperate to implement all of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous permission of all the states before their change, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most effective team in the world and the world champions in football in 2006.
Widely known sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and motorcycle racing "Formula-1".
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete at international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The beginning of Taiwan lies in the 15th century, when European sailors, sailing by, recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened branches in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of the practice of producing Aboriginal grain and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatan, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they looked at first.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world of still photographic image is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the era of analog photographic film.
Today, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has adopted the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format actually knocks a bit off the pan, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore considered 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APIS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The often used and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most effective place to place the main object is the intersection of lines that divide the raster into three-thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion held European states together, despite differences in languages and customs.
His omnipresent power had an impact on everyone: from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian provisions: wealth must fight suffering and poverty, and the money of the church is designed for this.
The central organ of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the church really adhered to this postulate.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective. Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms, codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries, it cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain has been mining in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany waited for a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing sentiments of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
Realizing the horror and cruelty of the war during the First World War, the nations sought to prevent this in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America, in order to apply for a vacancy in Edison's company in New York.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager on his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time intervals were depicted in a unique way; each stage of development of the country, then each ruling family, which became an outstanding dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Sango Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
During these times, there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three States was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China - thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, for example, the application of the metric system, the change of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is the property of the people, and not one sole ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were open to all men, giving the most ambitious and talented opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks on a class basis, they were now based on qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahomet was deeply interested in issues that went beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave, which became known as "Khira", on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual inclinations of Mahomet.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is quite difficult to find, even if it is known about its existence. Once you get to the cave, you will find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around. A very small part of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that exist to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many great pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was erected in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives and family members of Cheops.
The ticking "bounce up" looks like the letter "V", and the ticking "bounce down" looks like a bracket or square with no bottom.
Top means that you have to start with the head and push the bow, and down means that you have to start in the pads (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the bow is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to add your own marks with a pencil, but note that printed marks for bow tools have a certain value, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market drove out of Versailles the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, and forced them to return to Paris.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of loud and threatening people to the king and queen.
The Jurba forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point, a member of the gang waved in front of the horrified queen the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles.
The military expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to pay much of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Surplus profits from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos, of course, would be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that served as the impetus for the creation of the Order.
The era when these events occurred is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Classical Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is considered to be about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually covers a wide range of ideas, from the promotion of technology or technological imperative to the idea that the fate of a person in the strict sense is dictated by the basic logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that is predominantly beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an "influence" on societies that are more inevitable than socially driven.
For example, someone may argue that the machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically impractical for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods in the field of health care for the treatment of bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with this geography arose, and they, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being the epicentre of luxury, dating back to around 400 CE, and which lasted until around 1100 CE.
In the 12th century, his position deteriorated mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress of the inhabitants of the east was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was the fact that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons for fastening clothes.
Non-commodity agriculture is agriculture whose purpose is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the owner/master and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses harvested seeds of local plants of a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in natural agriculture, and this is still preserved in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to acquire a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation through the characteristic and symbolic use of a style that includes fashion items, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, unhappiness, or intentional cruelty, and were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "children of the jungle" or wild. They are often kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents leave their children free due to the rejection of severe mental or physical defects of the latter.
It may be that the savage children were the objects of abuse or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some allegedly raised animals; it was said that some lived in the wild alone.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost in the same way (within the limits of physical capabilities) as the corresponding animal caregivers, for example, treat people with fear or indifference.
And although design technologies should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching, but rather a help given to individuals learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as scaffolding, like the little man-crusher in the Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to query, prompt, and explain procedures that can be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that can start with neglect and lead to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of care, attention and upbringing, but they grow.
We feel that the foster home system should be a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Education in the foster family should provide everything they need, which they lacked in the house from which they were taken before.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The expressive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of use and pleasure.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of Aigmy and McCord's motivation (1998) as they explored audience reactions to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements that last several milliseconds.
In particular, they argue that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying using the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sachs, in his article “The President’s Speech,” pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in the interpretation of human behavior can have animals, for example, domestic dogs.
In the twentieth century, research has shown that there are two groups of genotypic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of pronounced variations.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with such a digestive system, as in humans, it is difficult to ensure the satisfaction of their needs for amino acids at the expense of available plant resources in the savanna.
Moreover, if this is not done, it will entail serious consequences: an increase in depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most available plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest by primates like us if not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well digested, but also supplies a significant amount of proteins that contain all the main amino acids.
Given all these things, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved the “protein issue” in much the same way chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposeful awakening during a normal period of sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you are resetting the clock in your dream, it can be placed at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is exactly the opposite of the level of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us from achieving this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the path of Mahayana love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened from yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central place in Tibetan meditation is occupied by the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, channels of energy are purified, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to the fact that these countries were digested.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, leading to the start of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and there were real battles between the armies of the countries on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost relevance in almost one night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, which violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most effective means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them in order to easily receive milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved in hills and other pastures, and they were cared for by goats, often children or teenagers, more commonly known as shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
The road was built in England in the 16th century.
And although the horse roads were essentially two parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that worked for them to develop higher speed and pull heavier loads than the slightly more rugged conventional roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced to keep the tracks in place quite early. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if an iron fastener was installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first known movement was walking, people started walking straight two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning a person walking straight)
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk in a vertical position, as usual.
Biologics are found in fossils of Australopithecines between 4.2 and 3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropians may have begun walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it is only as a treatment for symptoms. However, if we do not seek only a temporary solution, then it is worth finding the root of the problems and eliminating them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After Congress passed it on July 4, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlep's printing house, located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150-200 copies were made, now known as "Danlep Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy went to London on August 10.
It is currently known that 25 Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original copy of the manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have a lot to do with dinosaurs.
Their paws have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers used today work by processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary numbering system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and, to put it in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to immediately make a diagnosis.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open jar with a medical product or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label to get specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
From a formal point of view, entomologists describe this group of insects by the term beetle.
This term is a reflection of centuries of familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitizing in humans.
Both conical bugs and bed bugs are nest insects adapted to life in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged people, as well as younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or not in their child’s best interest.
Such parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopting (adopting), biological parents are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can raise a child.
The main goal of science is to learn scientific methods, how the world works. This method really manages most scientific research.
Although it is not just an experiment, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; the attitude of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all issues of science, including psychology, were recognized.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic factors, are recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators that will extend the cycle period, which is freely performed even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the matter of DNA being a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage as radioactive phosphorus, or the bacteriophage protein as radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the share of genetic material, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outbound activities include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as gaining new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in cars to get to their places of work, and other people drive past them, working in places they have just left.
In this dynamic transport movement back and forth, everyone is connected in one way or another and supports a transport system that is based on private cars.
Science now notes that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported the evolution of mankind over the past two million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses transport systems. At the same time, almost everyone complains about them.
You will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling down in developed countries.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and fail every day? Maybe transport engineers are simply incompetent? Is it about something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, since the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave fairly coherently; thus, transport flows mostly have some logical sequence, and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design and maintenance of roads.
Insects were the first animals to rise in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This opens up a wider range of small places where you can hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can not fold their wings are butterflies and one-dayers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed in his rightness, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes 6 miles wide.
As much as 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or technical perfection of their design.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the buildings of their predecessors, which were already much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their native form, and it is quite easy to extract them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they were being transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small quantities.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, after his appearance, the pencil became a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods appeared, the status and use of the pencil was reduced.
People are now writing messages on a computer screen with no need to get close to the bar.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when we invent something new.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling up a heavy vis. Splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The upper layer of the moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner there. Lavies were easier to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been adopted by them in the process of growing up.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make or don’t make them do certain things.
Two popular substantive theories are Maslow's Need Hierarchy Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when managers start managing their former colleagues. On the one hand, they try to stay "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, sharing responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he has to change everything that the team did and do it in his own way.
After all, the leader is fully responsible for the success and defeat of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtually created teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact with their immediate real group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet with time zones in mind, which may be incomprehensible to their local leaders.
The presence of a real "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual collective.
An "invisible team" is a management group that all members report to. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of introducing a learning organization that takes so much time? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice can be innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest.
As a result, the process of joint work of the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovation process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Thus, they narrow the search area and make it more accurate.
Scientists in their studies maintain a relationship between pathology in the brain and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with visual fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation of a machine.
During research in the field of AI, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intellectual behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer evaluations and questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as it has been embedded in several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important thing in any class. Often the teacher would like to visit with students places where it is impossible to get by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual on-site classes. Students can look at museum artifacts or admire the beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A virtual tour is also a great way to think about travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but its older versions are saved online as an album.
Blogs can also help improve a student’s writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
As students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers begin to try to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to be better informed about the world around them." The need to satisfy the interest of the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; actively reacting to materials from the Internet, students can determine their positions in the context of the articles of others, as well as outline their own points of view on individual issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase the history and modernity of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the sites beyond.
All of these and other things emphasize in Ontario what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited by wildlife.
A population comparison that may surprise many: The United States has more African-Americans than Canada has its own citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is itself a continent when it comes to wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took root heavily in Komorah and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope of Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel region, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All traveling women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It will also be advisable to wear a ring (only not the one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what you consider harassment, and it often happens that they follow you, grab your hand, etc.
Hardly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand on their own (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and named Casa Branca, and in 1755 after the earthquake left it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru-i-Badia, and the Spanish traders who created trading bases here gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Not far from the old Medina, it is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as Tajiks, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a number of trifles, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the center of the city.
Although Goma itself is quite safe, before any travel abroad, it is necessary to study the situation with the battles still ongoing in the province of North Kivu.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and for one of Africa's cheapest hikes to mountain gorilla sites.
To travel to Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, as well as the relative inaccessibility of the name "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included in the list of threatened World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops during the PBS report Miracles of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities of the country, because it has more Arabic color than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which holds different representatives of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the National Parks of the South African Republic (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and entry.
It may also be profitable for someone to buy a Wild Card, which gives the right to enter some parks in South Africa or all the National Parks of the South African Republic.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists pay special attention to.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong was compared to a brilliant histogram, manifested by the presence of the waters of Victoria harbor.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite port side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong is densely located on the territory along the northern shore.
It’s a place that has been taken over by British colonists, so if you’re looking for evidence of a colonial past territory, it’s a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, because they include some of the last islands of the powerful jungle, which once covered the Indo-Gang plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered with water or marshy terrain.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer on its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (through the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jacar/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses "Koster", which are comfortable and durable.
A shuttle taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to places nearby, such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The bridge over the Ojapoque River is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Ojapoque River and the city of Ojapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Ojapoque in French Guinea.
The pylons are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters. It has two lanes for the movement of vehicles with a width of 3.50 m each.
Vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The design was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who sometimes engaged in natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaikuru and the Paagua, which survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, as a result of clashes between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous peoples, Paraguay was created, which was formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news regarding tournaments and ticket sales for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged in a single bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are usually accepted anywhere in the islands, and many institutions also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, credit cards will most likely not be accepted, although they can take the currencies of Britain or the United States; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside their borders, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of the equator, there is summer at a time when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months the temperature is above +30 C - a familiar phenomenon.
Winter can be deceptively cool: the temperature rarely drops below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity in its combination make you feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rain" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park’s guidelines, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how humble they look, bison, big deer, elk, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them a place.
Also, remember that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so take them with you and do not cook the hiccups with the smell and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a little less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven vessels from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to abandon it.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the chieftain of the Tupou, Tamase Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the location of Auckland between the two harbors. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe to swim, and most of them are shaded by bush trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Bay of Waitemata, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint-Héliez in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with a large number of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer, "Number One" is simple, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines can better withstand transportation.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, however, if you’re afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of coffee "flet-white" is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino is prepared with a bitter cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets the requirements of Belgian standards. And fruit juices are not cheap, but they are beautiful.
Many trips to the reef occur all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to warnings about danger.
Kubomedusa are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be seen in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main natural environment is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Timely booking gives the traveler a calm confidence that he will have a place to spend the night as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often cooperate with specific hotels, although you can try to book with them some other accommodation, for example, camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of air travel and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your trip (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests still have to go through the travel agency first, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event visitors choose to spend the night on site, and for most visitors this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to come early to take a place closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has ceased to play, there may be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the placement of the cabin, because traveling through the ice causes a rather terrible sound if you are very close to its source.
Cruises in St. Petersburg provide for spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see the conditions).
Casinos tend to put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in good humor and indoors.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication negatively affects the ability to assess the situation, so all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or minus temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is small, and it is not allowed to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a storm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by the formation of water or ice on the windows of cars.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues unabated throughout the year.
Safari is probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa, which attracts the attention of many visitors.
The term safari in common usage means a journey on land to admire the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, so standard equipment will allow you to take a good look at them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are timid, and they are best observed in binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "safari walk", "safari trek" or "walking") is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the tournaments will be held in different places throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the suspension was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
The cancellation procedures vary, but at the end of March, most cancellation orders due to the coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020, the time for which the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most action tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry it. In many hotels, iron and ironing board can be rented, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron, or you do not like to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if there is one.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can cause abrasion, or in extreme cases, a cavity).
There are different ways to clean water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is different. If you have problems, you should think about buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals they have not heard of in their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.

Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise taxes in certain places.
Travelers who travel to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on commodities such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated forest wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with rural roads, take into account: they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths and sharp curves.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, mobile communication here is much better than on many other stretches of the route, for example, at the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavaria is quite rich and diverse, similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common: apples are used in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts growing on trees. Popular pies will often be especially delicious with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but delicious pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen" or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Kari is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found across the nation.
But, if used without further specification, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide selection of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of fragrant spices.
Stremens are supports for the rider's stipes that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous because of the rider's potential to get stuck in them.
If the rider has thrown the horse and the leg is stuck in a stirrup, the horse can run and pull it. To reduce the risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Further, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety devices, thanks to which the strap will fall from the saddle if the falling rider pulls it after him.
The Cochamo Valley, with a variety of granite high rises and steepness, is the main climbing site in Chile, which is also known as Yosemite of South America.

Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves going out on a slope covered in snow, on skis or snowboards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities involving many amateurs, sometimes referred to as "ski vagabonds", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skis is very old — cave paintings dating from 5000 BC depict skiers!
Skiing as a sport was started no later than the 17th century, and in 1861 in Australia, the Norwegians opened the first health ski club.
Ski Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing backpacking, skiing, or skiing.
This is related, but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, these latter are conducted on steep slopes and require the use of stiffer skis and shoes.
Consider the ski route similar to the tourist route.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to travel longer distances than on foot - but it is really rare that you will be able to reach the speed of running skis without a heavy backpack on well-maintained routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple passage of visa procedure and passport control.
However, the Schengen zone in this sense acts as one country.
Staying in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain visas separately from each of the countries that are part of the Schengen area, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies characterize products older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies by geographic location - the age limit in North America, for example, may be less than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived at the expense of fishing, hunting, etc., holding deer usually as draught animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern trade. Tourism in Sapma, where Sami live, brings substantial income.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among Negroes, it is considered offensive because of associations with negative stereotypes and mistaken perceptions of these people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes the subject of government travel recommendations, this may affect your travel health insurance and travel insurance.

Newsletters provide only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The data presented are often superficial, generalized and very simplified compared to more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions are a common term for any dangerous weather event that could potentially cause damage, serious social upheaval, or death.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they are of different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are the varieties and consequences of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water tornadoes and cyclones.

Travelers are strongly encouraged to learn about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, because they can affect the travel plan.
Anyone who plans to visit the country, which can be regarded as a war zone, must undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for the course "Hostile Environment" will probably issue the address of the local company.
As a rule, all the issues discussed here are revealed in the course in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
Typically, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid exercises, and sometimes fire training.
Books and magazines that talk about desert survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Tourists planning a sex change operation abroad should be sure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to suit the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to take into account such documents is also very diverse.

Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners while maintaining the integrity of their privacy and dignity.
Retardant currents are reverse currents from waves that break on shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of underwater topology, the reverse flow concentrates on several deeper areas, and a rapid flow into deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the flow, sailing back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try heading where you won’t get back to the flow or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, it might be better to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes earlier than cultural shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
Those travelers who had no problems adjusting to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are just as necessary for travelers when they return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities for children in the area.
You will be able to see the pyramids in the dark, and you will be able to see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and traders. The history of sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as the background decoration and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others - the island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano lies at the heart of the impressive natural harbor.
Elsworth Land is an area in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into a plateau, and then reappear, forming a 360-kilometer mountain range of Ellsworth, separated by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel range are the highest mountains of Antarctica: the Vinson massif and Vinson peak, which reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with clear visibility from the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used on ships, including pleasure craft and expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a vacation academy is travel and study.
This practice is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a break for a year without endangering their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during an academic vacation can really improve your chances of entering a university in your country.
Usually, such educational programs are paid.
Finland is a great place for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also covers thousands of islands, both in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don’t necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, taking into account that for every seven to eight people there is a boat.
This compares to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
Most of these notable cruises in the Baltic Sea are characterized by a long berth in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a few full days in a historic place, returning to the ship at night.
When you go to land only on ship tours, you do not need a separate visa (valid for 2009).
The brochures of some cruises include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrible test for people of any age and background, especially if they have not previously flown or experienced traumatic events.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it makes no difference to personal fears or disgust with other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help to overcome fear, which is based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Most often, the time is very important when it comes to delivering business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but in the case of other routes and small firms, they have faced a problem.
If they were to ship things by air, some routes would take several days to clear and customs would take several days.
The only way to do this quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Air transportation rules do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and here is your exit.
To fly in first or business class, obviously, for this privilege, you need to lay out a thick pile of money (or, even better, force your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can count on the fact that for a business class will pay 4 times more than the standard rate of economy class and eleven times more than the first class!
In general, on direct flights from point A to point B, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business class or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are ready to pay the maximum amount for the privilege of quickly and comfortably getting anywhere, so they charge an appropriate fee for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic affected by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, and unplanned failures are reported by the automatic system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, rude and haughty people.

The severity of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a bit of ordinary respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly from beech, pine and spruce, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptional variety of plant crops due to different microclimates and soil types, as well as variable heights.

Here you can find rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and deaf, as well as many other known species.
When visiting monasteries, women should be in skirts that cover their knees and have covered shoulders.
Most monasteries give capes to women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you will get a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that close their knees.
They can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes will not cross after each user, so you may be unpleasant to wear this clothing. One size will suit all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.

However, people who speak a little Spanish can hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it, and it does not need to be studied separately.
Today, ancient observatories tend to be outdated and act as museums or places of education.
Because light pollution during their heyday was not as problematic as it is today, they tend to be located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are huge objects in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom view, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor arranged the first cherry blossom festivals in the Imperial Palace only for himself and other members of the aristocracy.

Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and very easy to navigate, where you can buy just about anything upon arrival.
But, being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the scorching sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also several buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to board goes to Gebron, not just the nearest Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been similarly accepted by non-believers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night without sleep in some open place to see the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter service on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and believers often begin the celebration with the onset of the North to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands got here either by water or by air.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
After humans came to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will discover the polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky around the clock will be more or less dark.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which the inhabitants of Western countries are accustomed.
The standard business form of clothing are costumes. Employees address each other by name or title of position.
