28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a flight of stairs at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting: "At last, his affairs were going smoothly."
"The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia," the San Francisco Forensic Bureau said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galizia, told ABC's KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, a past delivery line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be sorely missed," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galizia said Frank was staying at the hostels first, but more recently, "It's finally working out."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galizia told KGO.
Luis Galizia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to cook us a meal, to cook us dinner,” said Luis Galizia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who was running.
“For all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.

The Central Bank of the country said that this amount is a historical maximum, reports RIA Novosti.
The previous record was set in May of this year.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest living of all vertebrate animals is the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Spa rest is necessary not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be brushed aside.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
And the most affected are people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with children, you do not have to part with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are wellness programs, which include diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and features of a growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide babysitters with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winter, long summer, an abundance of sunny days per year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water varies in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
So, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces sugar levels.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have water "Slavianovskaya".
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because the salts delay the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
Taking mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in sanatoriums, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are available.
What types of rehabilitation, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, silt mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorption, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks along individually compiled routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take baths wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, sage-lacry, depending on what you appoint a doctor.
Extend the fruiting.
What can be done to ensure that the harvest lasts until the end of the season?
According to Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and summer resident.
It's time for tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut off the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as pepper and eggplant, are fed with ash-superphosphate extracts, processed with biopreparations (the Maturer - to accelerate the infusion and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamayr, Bactofite - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxicidlin, Leupid).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap should be used.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-tailed cucumbers in the greenhouse are allowed from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, water with warm water and a solution of Zircon, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruiting of zucchini: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, sprinkle fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night cold, install an arc with covering material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
As noted by analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend - in the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
Slow growth is ahead.
According to experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind us, and slow economic growth is ahead,” the Bank of Russia said in its bulletin “What the trends are talking about.”
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter was increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of economic development, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15, ”RIA Novosti quotes the representative of the MAYOR.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the “bottom” has passed.
Among other markers indicating signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If you make an adjustment for the fact that the year is a leap year, then it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August from the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy,” emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, Russia has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, also shows positive dynamics.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favorable situation in the labor market, the issue of real disposable incomes of the population leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the indicator decreases by 4.8%.
This factor can hamper the recovery of the economy, since household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tough policy of the Bank of Russia can also be called as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015,” says Irina Rogova, an analyst at the Forex Club Group of Companies.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly settled in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and are former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about natives of countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the opposite process - quite a large number of Russians perform under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that abroad will be created the best conditions for development in sports.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of a 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa the Red.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a pole.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to “move” Yelena Isinbayeva from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only countrywoman, albeit an ex, in the sector for jumping with a pole.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirogkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Largely because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in wrestling in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, she managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was brought up by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Maria continued her studies there.
Soon she was already part of the U.S. national team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronicists, but for America, its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue her training in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, she, of course, did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former “artists” is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Yana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to still win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, this time a sportswoman - Irina Sazonov.
If the ways of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira trains still in Russia - she specially comes to her homeland in order not to lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal all-around.
There is very little information about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance - 14th place in the complex relay 4-100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports grounds.
Triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, at home is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in gymnastics.
It has not achieved much at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronous swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroiter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kroiter won the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirova, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Excellence of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011, even becoming the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR volleyball player Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship held in his new homeland.
Khadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and came with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and currently plays for the national team of this country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to record high results in Russia.
He was a bronze medalist at the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Tired of not getting into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last in our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur became the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children need cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "the Cossacks need to be brought up not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least 7 years to understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But while this work, I think, is carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb everything positive that was accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is in a hurry and unknown, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on the funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from budgets at different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and communal services sector.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid energy more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the Prosecutor’s Office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the costs of LLC "IV-consulting" (by puts cold water) were laid 4 million rubles. for car rental at a price above market.
There are many such examples in the country.
According to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
They just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay service providers and spent them on his own needs.
As a result, damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of machinations Makarov, alas, typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who appropriated the money of citizens, swept through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan, by the way, is also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo, Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, two others played the role of cash centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, his beloved.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Cases are not initiated, they are delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razrotneva, Executive Director of the NP "HQCK Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
Experts, including among judges, on housing issues are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
Refusals to initiate criminal cases, about red tape in the course of investigations are also spoken in the Prosecutor General’s Office.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes committed in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
For the rest, the investigation has become protracted, and one in five has been suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written off by them to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the meeting of tenants?
This means that the change of management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinion of the owners.
And this means that the market of housing and communal services can not break through to normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population.
It turns out that the tenants are in the red, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such throughout the state, - Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property, is sure.
And now this work is actively being carried out.
These are not just isolated actions - this is a purposeful course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital scandals and does not smell.
Why in Moscow there are no such scandals in the housing sector, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed iron will and brought order, - said Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I am referring to the personnel issue, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Management companies are closely supervised, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and residents’ appeals, and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but closely monitor what is written there, how the house is kept.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a significant part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Does it depend on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you need to change your place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon the friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, suggesting a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a coup.
He said this when speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged Americans to abandon support for the “terrorist organization of the Fethullahists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split in relations between Turkey and the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change the power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and Feto (The Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either a coup by FETO or a democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice,” the Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan’s appeal, which was made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but already more strongly demanded from the United States to comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the insurgency.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate authorities in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the mutiny was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Also, Erdogan’s supporters admitted that the coup could be directly involved in the Americans.
The United States denied all claims, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement of the representatives of the state Department on this issue was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also makes demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union, if Brussels does not name the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, the introduction by Ankara of amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not receive the expected support from him.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sector - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu news agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we began to look for others,” the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates a serious disagreement between Turkey and the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go for a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West in terms of both business and military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance while maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post,” the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on non-payment of compensation to the EU, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), he will be pressed.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko said.
Alexei Mukhin, head of the Center for Political Information, admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance on Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, "- said Mukhin.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which with its help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert believes.
A different point of view is held by the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazova.
Now relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is due primarily to the domestic policy pursued personally by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to carry out a reset in politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, and active political cooperation with Iran is underway,” Glazova explained, admitting that the next step of Erdogan will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively.
Now there have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s positions both on the regional and international arena,” the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult to return Turkey to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to harshly respond to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) JDC is going to ask its full board to support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the employment contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to “persistently keep silent” about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuing program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute has led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the Public Health Service.
The leader of the BMA junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to overturn the agreed terms of the employment contract that the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take, during meetings ahead of a vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of the Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked strained, and he hardly radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has spoken repeatedly about his “dear friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this point was furious.
Mr. Putin burst into anger, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a stunning, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal oil trade from the zones of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of its own kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed from his post last month in a coup attempt.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They put on the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Vedomosti newspaper said.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her lingering discontent with the turtle-like pace of talk of joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move — which seeks to take advantage of the cool and gradually erode Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a total catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it’s definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank had retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, the brand’s strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one our staff will be employed in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, since at the core (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you’re seeing a lot of change.
We can get those brands back again, so I think the timing is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a Newmarket victory on Passion
Dettory sprays champagne after a take at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettory scored his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, the Passion, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in the smooth races.
It follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, since this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big social event, it’s not a Royal Ascot — it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unassuming.
Dettori takes applause when he cites Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached such a mark in the races with obstacles: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical ingenuity that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and big horse racing!
Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but what’s more, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid jump from the horse
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many big race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while yet — Dettori had previously said he would like to continue to compete until at least age 50.
Putin dismisses head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not give a reason.
Mr Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his dismissal and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do you believe in smiles?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at will.
But despite the smiles on camera, this has convinced few people here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man who was once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It’s true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB’s State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
The star of the series “Think like a criminal” Thomas Gibson dismissed after a fight with the producer
Gibson was part of a brawl on the set of a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and differences of opinion.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be cut from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and most importantly, the very best fans the show could have ever dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Previous story Fish landed in the garden of Banff
A man from Banff sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could be sand grains left by a water tornado.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone can shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern span and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the "canvas fans", which are now coming to completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 screws of the bridge.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel are used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the clamping between the viaduct and the bridge leaf is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, concrete coating is cast in Rosyte today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to climb to the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the Northern pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern — or bank-facing — side.
This was done by pulling up the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of about 3%.
Graceful because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were "lucky to stay alive" after being thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 1:20 p.m. British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men struggled to swim to safety while their ship continued on its course.
"We saw their ship circling next to them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre's steering lifeboat Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man 60 years old was found exhausted and caught in a buoy without a lifejacket.
All of them were raised on board the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency breaker, but it somehow disconnected from the man driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It’s exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking into screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I’m of course referring to the craze that Pokémon Go is, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all this lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go to look for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation who played the game when they were younger joined in the craze, breaking away from the couches to look for.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps an "ordinary" person takes on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people it tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the passage of levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have found no response, because most health messages are boring and are voiced by people who look miserable.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and an even longer list of benefits, too long to cite here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people outside to do what they love.
Thus, three fundamentals of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunshine and joy.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, there are boring people who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone applications such as Fitbit could still track our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to practice, as this game gives.
The novelty will subside, and the use will weaken with time.
However, because of Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the commotion.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all this.
Dynamic on the reference jump.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
Finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing the chasm between herself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic scrutiny.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Biles from the United States performs on the gymnastics log during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of absolute champion and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears as she showed her final overall score and her long journey to that point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold ones - with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and others in this area, but between her and the burden of inflated expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unreasonable expectation.
Simone Biles from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hugging after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the Women's Individual Absolute Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for retiring national team coordinator Martha Caroli's farewell party.
While Byles insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, this is not entirely true.
Part of her free exercise program — one that includes her signature walkway — is set to Latin music that would fit right in at home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and opened by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship competition since the summer of 2013 — a streak of luck that should last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina gained a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
A gymnastic log and free exercise — where Byles defends the title of world champion — lie in ambush.
She went ahead again with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her while they waited for the final score — a clean formality — and tears appeared around the shiny red with a white and blue eyeliner for Biles when the idea she had once recorded on the scrapbook came to fruition.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared the third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina on a tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call “grandmother” was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, gripped by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Byles, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the deadliest attack in the first Phoenix serial killer in a decade, were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The attacker fired about eight shots from a gun while standing on the passenger side of the car, then fled on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple murder does not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check if it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a four-month period.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the house," Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence, which led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
The liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
A witness told police there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and removed the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: “It’s getting better”
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, is not true — of course you subscribe to it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to place him in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people would do that anymore,’” Pixivto said.
Edmund walks with his walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But it is slowly passing through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just plain sign language — she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of babies with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rain expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have sprung from shore and are threatening widespread flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and help had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high-water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that it was only the arrival of Tanjipahoa that requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could overwhelm the area.
In southern Alabama, flood-expectancy was in effect until Friday, as rain continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Emite River near Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, were both predicted to set a flood-level record over the weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding going downstream in the parish of Assenshen is a threat, as these upwelling rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flooding in Aimee and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest influx she had seen in 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have a disability, and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltering on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to work to rescue residents from homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that an adviser to Tanjipahoa told about 200 flooded houses.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now being flooded.
The parish’s chairman, Robbie Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded in high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services Rupert Lacey reported that the rain continued to rain on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said several homes were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aimee, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Tauson said, "and it's still pouring down to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "shot-wrecked", remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,” says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He had to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims have been reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shootout between several armed men.
Cases from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different instances of semi-automatic weapons, settled the scene.
It definitely seems like a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So, apparently, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shootout,” Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly watching security cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women’s Olympic gymnastics team this year and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And the second: in this team, three gymnasts play a key role: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lory" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This place looks like America at last.
It also strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America applauded.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And teammate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastic sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported with the help of parents paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, fees for participation in competitions, payment for hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it is an expensive and long-term duty for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Honey, coach of Lori Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes, located in Harlem, for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mostly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to grueling work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is great.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of “Women’s Power” in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took to the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of the proposal of Jeremy Hunt
Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve after-hours services.
Dr. Ellen McCoth, chair of the BMA’s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement: “Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And that’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction, and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are clear that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April brought about 13,000 planned surgeries and 100,000 nursing appointments to be postponed, while nurses and consultants were involved to ensure doctors were replaced on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
VMA wants better pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services that are already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of carers and corporate awareness policies.
The employees hoped that continued positive contributions on other important topics — such as staff distribution, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine — were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
A drug for 2 euros a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for 2 ? a day, after the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service (NHS) has advised giving it to people for four years to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE supervisory service of the National Health Service of Great Britain advised to give it to people for four years in order to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks into parts, then this can cause a thrombus that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move along the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Center for Medical Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods in about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke is occurring — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective at reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are excited to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information about the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited beyond three years, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond that time.
PC Ownership Culture Allows Vote Counting to Thrive in Muslim Areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to blindfolding, which has resulted in widespread vote-counting fraud in Muslim communities, according to the government’s devastating report released today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, has criticized police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of election irregularities because of his “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
A former local community secretary, now an anti-corruption czar, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters should only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people’s fingers when they hand in their ballots, with the goal of eliminating so that someone can vote twice.
Better protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were cast in doubt or were the result of a persona when a person votes by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
“There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote at the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were concerns that ... government agencies were turning a blind eye to this behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the "harvest of votes."
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is under consideration.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and envelopes with postal voting.
Give the police the authority to establish borders around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the Representation of the People's Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff forces voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric violently attacks the city police, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the inconclusive “checks for the sake of the tick” of the election registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Ridiculous on the bicycle analogue of Kate and other twins of celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, which, as it turned out, is impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old isn’t the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who boasts her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the bike path, many people online hastened to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, caused the storm on Twitter after images emerged of him looking frighteningly like Wall Street’s Wolf Star.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social networks and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge similarity, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on the face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarities between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh was compared to the star of the Choir Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a “sports version” of the actor “Inception”
Another long-continued comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist from Russia Yulia Efimova can boast not only equally tanned skin and blond hair like that of actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like a “sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt”.
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same facial and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to reveal his delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, U.S. soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful broad smile, which is similar to that of the star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Analysis of Byron McDonald fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the women's relay freestyle 4x200 m outraged on Wednesday viewers of CBC in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stink" and "died like a pig" while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought to the CBC comment team to “dip it in color,” saying, “This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started off like a stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett MacFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'???
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users couldn’t resist hearing how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, that’s a lot of work for . . . ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald's comment, stating, "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance getting on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
IFOR ended up apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
Last night, we acted swiftly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I was talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about her personally."
"It goes without saying that there was no disrespect involved, and I'm sorry."
A Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers did not know where to look when a woman naked to try on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall store in Folkestone.
Shop Primark Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after fitting her underwear, the mysterious woman again “dressed and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the store, she took a pair of panties from the shop window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find somewhere secluded to do it — she just stood there, shameless.”
"Everyone stared when she took her panties off again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing she liked about it, dressed up again, and walked out.
"It doesn't seem like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought of the person who would eventually buy those panties she was trying on."
Jennie Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is going to take home panties that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been washed.”
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these garments from the sale after she left - and all the better."
"Wouldn't like to come home with a new pair of women's underpants and find that another woman put them on and took them off and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All the goods in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'liberate the line of fire'.
Then, you tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follows the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a barrel and walk back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, suitable from the front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any heist — if you’re not a Krav Mag master — is to give away your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Ian Wright spends his language on the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler has put his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, a 51-year-old from Suffolk, spoke the euro note, Piccadilly Circus railings, a toilet button on a train, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called “Guide to the Traveler-Lizun on the Internal Force”, gave some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely abhorrent, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked did not bring him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he directed, he said, "Since I was a child, I've been completely carefree about my health and I've been pulling a lot of different things in my mouth out of the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer value greater than 4,000 units.
For comparison, just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a film about a traveler called “The Inner Power Traveler’s Guide,” which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've smelled in the toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lisun Traveler's Guide to Internal Power" was filmed together with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains fermented milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help speed up the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio’s senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Vuorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in more context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let’s just say I would lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.”
Naturally, some things Jan was easier to lick, and some were pretty tough.
I’m glad we were able to capture some of these licks on film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked fermented milk bacteria exclusively to good stomach and bowel health, and 58 percent said they consumed, at least occasionally, foods containing added fermented milk bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, Cornwall’s municipal home, on the eve of eviction.
A family of hooligans left their municipal home at a loss of 50,000 euros after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing cooperatives found the property in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, the debris was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid there was no way to save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as a not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is infamous.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
Floor boards in a house that used to sell drugs were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week, after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and then regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered lower on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant was not able to accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to give us the information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all slightly over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove piles of debris that surround the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as scales, related accessories and 1,700 euros in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money was used to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there are reports that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the premises lease rules
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without accusing the accuser, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun are scared for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane spied over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft engines, but not being able to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: "It flew quite low twice, and there was a moment at which it seemed like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were terribly scared when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than normal due to lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires have damaged the mainland of Portugal, as well as claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The plane was performing a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food manufacturers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Inspections of the business by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But while officials write fines only for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents").
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account risks when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the Customs Union.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business had 4 years (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the Customs Union in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
We, unfortunately, for a long time were sure that the norm concerns only food production, and not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date of resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause excessive demand, since their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since most accommodation facilities have already been booked before the end of September in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian sea tourism products.
According to the North-West regional branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding when the charters will be resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary on the direction of the sides, ”says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, General Director of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is not worth counting on the hype - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the excitement is not worth waiting for.
“For Turkey, launching charters now is a rehearsal for next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season,” agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from personal income tax established by law compensation payments within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
Issuance of milk to employees engaged in work with harmful working conditions according to the established norms is provided for by Article 222 of the LC RF.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of February 16, 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, income in the form of the value of milk issued to employees on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow “Gazstroybank” was left without a license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license for banking operations from the credit institution Joint-Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROYBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSCB GAZSTROYBANK carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to implement bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit operations.
In the bank, a temporary administration is appointed for a period of validity until appointment to the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSCB "GAZSTROYBANK" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, the assets of JSCB "GAZSTROYBANK" as of August 1, 2016 occupied 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Qadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks that are at stake when traveling to a war zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultans’ family said she married an ISIS operative in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a Supreme Justice candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's approval, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reed's spokeswoman later said he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and simply made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “rock the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said that the Republicans who block Garland’s nomination are the “hyperpaths” and “supporters” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for the job.
Treats says erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Bellmer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to get back to showing an eternal and classic nude figure where women, just like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given memos about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
This will be general information and legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
In the application will be given recommendations on how to make a claim and so on,” — said in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian foreign Ministry published a statement in which he called the name of the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them - Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtey Andrey Romanovich.
"They all give confessions," the report said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporozhye region Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt during the interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency’s website.
“The penalty for Google for violating antitrust laws amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay a fine in the near future,” said Alexey Dotsenko, FAS Deputy Head.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play app store only on the condition that other applications of the corporation are installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Art. 10 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, among other things," said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulation Department of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects the collusion of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The chain of stores "New book" fined for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide", according to the city news agency "Moscow".
According to Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents."
The Ostankino district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor.
A source in the New Book confirmed that this is the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are checked for the presence of the book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow there will be an evening in memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow there will be an evening in memory of sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, TASS reports.
The event will be held on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to commemorate it on their native land,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown, including poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the Pushkin State Museum Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov, were invited to the evening.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Neizvestny plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably, until August 14.
The ultimate consumer of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rushed to litter the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenMiddleYears, this statement follows from the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussed revival of records is not due to a boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to feel the novelty of the material object, but the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are highly likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of gathering by amateurs — it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked through the middle of the busy Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating violently before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Okay, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt - hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent sellers - several music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to various people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgow-born Stewart, 55, followed by me from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and strolling around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I suppose so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn't chase him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles comes in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they first came out and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of what I’m getting is the late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy for,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my fault.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by the hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
Spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some older customers, in particular, are insulted by the non-cash payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retire into the permanence of familiar record envelopes, items that evoke memories of a serene youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or owning material things as a kind of comfort,” says Wes.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It’s an easy way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by scrolling through a stack of Bosanoff compilations.
The trophy aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,’” he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the piece, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not the elderly, they are a little under twenty, who are just getting acquainted with this.
Fopp, which has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less laid-back than in the aforementioned stores — Wild Beast’s latest synth and sexy pop, rather than jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers — it’s nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a painful psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn’t earn much, she says, so collecting records isn’t a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she plunges into dreams with a sigh filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion of looking at denim tight shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter discuss buying a Crosley player.
On the left there is a staircase, the wall of which is set by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack records: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just an ornament, some are so high up on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is real art vinyl.
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the hinterland of Soho for a while more, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in SoHo record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or offices.
But they clearly don’t spend the morning of Thursday walking through the record stores on Berwick Street, scrolling through records and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, home to thousands of refugees.
At court hearings this week, Calais authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made shops, where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for a few euros at home-made restaurants.
Calais Prefecture has said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing camp population.
Self-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel people running 72 home-made stores, but said the problems of Kale Prefecture "were fully understood."
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One place that was threatened with demolition was the Camp Jungle Book children's cafe, which works for no gain and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under the age of eight."
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers at the Jungle Camp have risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young freemen to educational programs.
This week, branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the sportsman.
The programs are aimed at the children's audience, so most of them will be held in a game form.

Britain stops at silver in Rugby 7 after Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The UK's impressive series in Rugby 7 was crushed at the final hurdle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji was given a master class in ball possession, evading, evading, supporting the game, running lines, and brute force to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not-so-poor consolation in the form of silver — Britain's third in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby 7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier in the day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji in this form won the best possible team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK — but probably not — that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, a former England chief from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off great, fighting off attempts by Britain to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerryr Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell kept Mountain Man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but that only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another after resuming and the clock still had more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
Realization led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby 7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much what it is.
Great Britain made massive substitutions for half the game, and they clogged the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game has long followed the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji's complete joy.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake that did not need embellishment, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the UK fell to the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly outscored South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one try each — the difference is the British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with the help of some magnificent leg work, tore the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last-ditch interception attempt from Marcus Watson, the 15-way brother of England's team, Anthony, secured the victory - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win rowing coach fight against cancer
There will be no more thrilling gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added value to their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two that pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there while they were aiming for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with the elegance of swans do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing battalion of ready-made hands contributing to the incremental victories that are important, and there are no hands that have been more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see this day.
Like he said, it was dangerous.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don’t, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio are lucky to have been able to start treatment in early 2014 off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it can be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to be paid, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking just a few steps away.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little bit too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and so has Robin.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you so much to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were in a phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t trying to do something amazing.
We didn’t expect fireworks today, we just expected to be able to row well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her wedding next month, at her own with television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government extended the term of destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited for import to Russia.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import some types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of banned products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for "prohibited"
On Friday in Moscow, rains and thunderstorms are expected.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
In the afternoon, the air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow, sometimes there will be short-term rain, thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m / s are possible.
In the afternoon it is expected to rain with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m / s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in the Orel, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Days.ru".
Rainfall is unlikely in the next working week.
The panel of WTO arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation,” the organization said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union has not provided sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures “were systematic” or “were comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of economic development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted by the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term South Korean judge Jang Song Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
In the administration of the President has changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers important the anti-corruption work that he began as head of the presidential administration, Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts believe that the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration is transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who worked in the presidential administration for quite a long time, effectively built the activities of the presidential administration.
Instead, came the Deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino - a person who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive to it due to a reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish financial company Bohuslav Majec.
His words are reported by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not completely buy gas [from Gazprom], we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” said Majec.
Currently, Gazprom holds a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the purchase of PGNIG increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish antimonopoly authority did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will be held in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact of filing a statement by the Polish PGNIG with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court in order to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
We will remind, the Commissioner of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimsky said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Piotr Naimski, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two lines of the offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, responding to a question from journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the Network appeared a video landed at the airport of Ufa passenger plane Yak-42, which rolled out of the runway for 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by TV channel 360.
The emergency occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates normally.
Volga Investigative Department on transport of the TFR began to find out the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, believes the fact of what happened is undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack with the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw-in.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense accused the opposition group “Kharakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki” of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I smelled gas, I started burning my eyes, it became difficult to breathe,” the eyewitness said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of a daily three-hour lull in the organization is considered “insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to bring aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a truck convoy to areas where the roads are practically destroyed, and those that remain are mined,” Egeland said.
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia Opened “Humanitarian Windows” in Aleppo
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia on Aug. 11 announced a three-hour ceasefire that will be in place every day starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the requirement to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups have yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s interior ministry has rushed to state that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the leading military.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries to demonstrate development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the interior Ministry of the country "are confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions, Mr Patanacharoen said.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identity of those who were behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand’s Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithichai Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with dining in restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identity of the other victims is still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian national.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the explosions with the referendum held on August 7, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft of a new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission for the drafting of a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We will remind, on May 22, 2014 in Thailand there was a military coup under the leadership of the commander of the army of the country Prayut Chan-Ocha.
The move, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military established a National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok found itself in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in central Bangkok, near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, which injured 28 people, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown people on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and enlisted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Dry Log, the development of conditions began.
As it became known to Kommersant, the government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, while maintaining two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed to prevent companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), said two sources familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them said.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of the Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who oversees the subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project has not yet been received by the official’s staff.
“The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the release of the government order, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can take place in October,” the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to ministries and federal agencies in July (have Kommersant).
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25% of the state participation.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of the Federal Law 57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as Kommersant wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal significance (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the government order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, Kommersant said in December 2015 to the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, “who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec.”
Who lobbied for a restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of "Kommersant" do not specify.
“But it’s in the spirit of the times: not to give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions,” says the interlocutor of “Kommersant”, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy said that foreigners “can go to a consortium” if applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners.”
The interlocutors of “Kommersant” consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners created the joint venture SL Gold, where Polyus has 51% of the shares, Rostec RT-GR has 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Polyus said Kommersant is “certainly interested in this asset” and has all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions are announced," Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, sources told Kommersant.
The possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold miners of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated Kommersant investment in Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants scare away not only the volume of investment, but also the complexity of the project: serious additional exploration of reserves and technologies for working with complex ores is needed, Kommersant’s interlocutors in the industry explain.
On the pension market launched the largest deal M&A - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension savings" will be created NPF with a volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure for combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "PromAgrofund", "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension Savings" - yesterday the owner of 100% of the funds of "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" LLC announced.
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is held on the basis of "Gazfond Pension savings".
As the general director of this NPF Oleg Byaloshitsky notes, the pooling of funds allows solving several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated date for the completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF, Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the combining funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are now Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled by LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
So, controlled by the group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the funds "Uralsib" and "Russian Standard".
“Uniting into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” said Nikolai Sidorov, general director of NPF Future.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is going on in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfund" should join the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF "Trust" will join them.
"The pooling of funds will give an effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses," Safmar said in a statement.
The pause in the pooling of funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator has withstood may be due to several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds, in which the group was actively placed.
After amendments to the resolution of the Central Bank in March this year for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player, ”says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of financial institutions of ACRA.
Several heads of NPFs from the top 15 for assets another possible reason for the pause called the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond to the request "Kommersant".
Although the consolidation of funds is a laborious and expensive event, at a long distance this decision will be justified.
According to Sergey Okolesnov, CEO of Pension Partner consulting company, Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "PromAgrofund" will be in demand in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is inexpedient to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
"The effect of the reduction of duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of unification," Mitrofanov said.
The cost of combining the four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, while consolidating in the medium term, the budget really cut by half,” said Mr. Okolesnov.
In the Russian rental was released the kindest Disney movie “Pete and his dragon”.
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the alluring dragon, the soulful story and country songs are enough to once again believe in old-fashioned magic, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nurse, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, overgrown and in a loincloth, can no longer be distinguished from another clever forest plucker - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired female hero Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively plows the forest.
Now she will have not only to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also to help save him.
Pete goes through an accelerated course of “being human” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their heart, and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too awful for the viewer to really start hating or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be not at all terrible, with a kind face of a bulldog, an airliner wing span and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon laughs funny, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to stroke, this he compares favorably with all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments they begin to cry desperately in three streams not only small spectators, but also adults.
Amazingly good and underage, Oakes Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuoso gives the canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie Dragon Pete, mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and motion pictures, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
It was a miracle that helped.
In his painting Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Behind the board were musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good fairy tale read the features borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other sweet to the heart children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the XXI century.
Of course, “Pete and the Dragon” is not as stunningly beautiful as the same “Jungle Book”, and it does not have the skillful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be as a stepmother in the new “Cinderella”.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magic castle of Disney director Lowry will receive once again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
Worked out in the “Pete and his dragon” tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project about a not growing up boy based on the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will face a new charge
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in the case of their client.
We learned about the fact that the prosecutor’s office made such a presentation from the investigators just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting ultimately did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor's office," lawyer Olga Dinze said.
She said that the prosecutor's office indicated to the investigators that the qualification of the case and the materials collected were not in conformity.
Now investigators will have to fill in the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or the same will remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by "Kommersant", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation to RBC the wording about “shaking the political situation towards instability” and “overthrowing power illegally”.
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
Life doesn't seem to stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village are carried out without stopping, since some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents drawn heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our, consider, exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it there are some flaws.
It's hot water problems, then, I'm sorry, toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but they only popped some substance on the floor, and that's all.
You see, they are innovative.
You can’t wash them humanly.
Yes, we know these floors - the laminate is ordinary!
In general, we have achieved a change of the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, sometimes flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which vending machines walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two ads at the reception: printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and handwritten "I will accept the badges as a gift.
The stand itself is buried in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Memorial on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding".
The text inside is very encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone is waiting for a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide residents with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is actually the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, “No matter what, we’ll win!”
And, of course, poetry:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even more upliftment hangs the announcement: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer service and other requirements by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all confessions.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the congestion of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during a fire.
And in the dark, he stumbled on the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I believe that in readiness to rush at any time to wash innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour for themselves directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend - Vitaly Fyodorovich Dubko, coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his European champion student, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show off their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about by and large, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live two by two, the beds, of course, are almost side-by-side, but this is uncritical.
The bathroom is one in four, but it is spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not cause trust, but something can be put.
"No, well, you pretend, their tea is over!" - hands tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
There are 60 thousand servings per day completely free.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Cooks of the world", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I looked, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, for example, I did not find soups in any of the departments of the giant restaurant.
What soups? - surprised Kuznetsova. - Tea is not!
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in general, for you to understand, our food on the courts is even worse.
You can choose something, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite, I admit, it was edible.
I don’t know why it’s always at McDonald’s.
Satisfied, relaxed, you can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Tricked dexterously - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoked, you might say.
To get a gift, you need to correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But he didn't.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, naturally.
The situation escalated already on the second question: "If I received a notification about passing doping control, should I immediately go to the point of doping control?"
I stopped at option B: "No - I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to wait for WADA.
Anyway, you have to show up immediately.
But in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and by the way, I find it difficult!), then I can use supplements to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not forbidden, but strongly, in several proposals they dissuade.
It's not fair to Wada!
How's it going, Russia? - mockingly asks the host of the quiz.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and our whole blood-soaked team.
So I concentrated and won the unfortunate shirt with the last strength.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
I am interested in counting trainers.
It's down to 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let those who can’t play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line for the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as in the whole village, wherever you spit, there is a device for issuing condoms.
It is written on it an encouraging call: "Celebrate with the condo!"
Then it remains only to twist the iron, resembling a door lock handle, and the condom, made of natural latex Amazon, readily falls out of the apparatus.
I took one for me to remember.
Athletes will not lose - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for a festive and leisurely pastime in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, just in case, there is a cognitive sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video simulators.
- I am interested in a friend in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses an unusual toy.
You could, of course, just say that you do not want to talk to a person in the form of the Russian national team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, for some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes of ragged from the guys in yellow and blue.
The most important game, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village, looking into every corner of it.
But, if you walk, and not ride on electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian national team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a recovery bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and mail with unique brands (only you still can not wait out the queue of Chinese philatelists and banks),
And late in the evening, you, exhausted, will sit next to an olive tree hung with colorful ribbons in memory of friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you'll be accompaniment to a machine randomly spraying insect-killing liquid, thinking about the eternal.
About the Olympic Movement.
Which doesn't stop for a minute in this village.
While the rest of the Russian world breathlessly watched as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite who saw how it happened — not including those, of course, who that evening watched the competition in Carioca.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Imagine a night in Moscow.
Neighbors from below - as always by one o'clock in the morning - wake up and begin to scream at each other without malice, but very loudly.
And move furniture in a threatening way.
There is a tap in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
In the television schedule, nothing is clear, so just kept control of the channels “Match”, “First” and just in case “Russia” — although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" - the birthplace of repetition, the whole sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, on the "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news outlets first about the great semi-final of Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is USA-Australia.
By the way, I can’t say anything bad about this decision.
Australians were on equal terms, the first half won at all.
Put in the place of freaked out by their own greatness of the Americans.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will not be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with DiFranczyska is coming, and on the screen there is no change.
In a mild panic, I begin to flip channels.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep into the cable.
None of the themed "Match" fencing.
I feel like the fight is about to start.
Text and Tweeting of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the site of "First", it turns out that there is a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I call for fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazov perfectly counterattacks, goes ahead on points - and obviously begins to drag time.
The Italian is almost out of the way.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Franchiska rushes at Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian gives an injection.
Victory!
After a couple of seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma ordered its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to “learn their native language.”
The administration says that this “in no case infringes” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
“For those who say that it is “heavy”, in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free,” said Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques of the sermon "should already be in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the DOM of Tatarstan publishes the Shura magazine with model sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, "can thoroughly prepare for them."
The DOM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language in the districts.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques used primarily Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task to ensure that all students speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
“There can be no question of any infringement of the Netatar Muslims,” Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself is “not an obligatory, basic part of prayer.”
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision was actively supported by the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
Rinat Zakirov, head of the executive committee of the VKT, said: “Messages are an important part of our national life.”
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language “the desire of the imams themselves”, but the executive committee of the CGT “believes it is right”.
Interviewed imams who conducted sermons in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the Duma, but believe that parishioners will have difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they will be tight.
“We will have to rebuild,” says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the sermons in Russian are closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian is in schools, kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere from the very beginning."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
God will show the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
Many foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we switched to Russian for four years,” the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language sermons will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The result of the preaching will be different.
But time will tell.
“For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language,” Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service was put on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor’s Office approved the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the SSU of the Investigative Committee on embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
Former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles worth of damage to the Federal Penitentiary Service, will appear before the court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office sent to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court a criminal case against the former Director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise "Center for Information and Technical Support and Communications of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences" (FSUE CITOS) Victor definedov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the Investigative Committee of Russia under Part 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which entailed grave consequences), Part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, on an especially large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the TFR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the Federal Penitentiary Service to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the FSUE CITOS enterprise under their control, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and sold at prices inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FSUE CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, structures for placing production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE turned out to be more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. cash received personally Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case against which is allocated to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the fraud, was found to have an unknown origin of ammunition for the award pistol, which allowed him to be charged with an additional charge.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penitentiary Service filed a claim for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of former footballer and then member of parliament Hakan Shukur and conducted searches in two of his family’s homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s striker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the country’s authorities in connection with an attempted coup last month.
The striker, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
We are talking about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan considers the organizer of the attempt of a military coup, which occurred on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today was issued a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, the organization Fethullah Gulen in addition to Hakan Shukur himself included his father.
However, neither the former football player nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.

He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian “Torino”, “Inter” and “Palermo”, as well as English “Blackburn”.
However, he has not played more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective striker of the Turkish national team: he has 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy post due to the beginning of a corruption investigation around Erdogan’s party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of having links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media workers could face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, which have huge budgets," he said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in the Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of the former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov, Konstantin Akulich, was detained.
As reported by "Yu-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulicha today called in the investigative Department of the ICR Miass to charge in the case a year ago about the beating.
Then Konstantin Akulich went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"It was initially initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich," Sergey Kolosovsky believes.
Konstantin Akulich became the lawyer of the ex-deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the call of the lawyer in the TFR Miass, the defense side was notified that on Monday the deadline for familiarization with the materials of the fraud case, in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused, expires.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK undertook the modernization of one of the oldest and ecologically “dirty” enterprises in the country - the Karabash copper smelting plant.
Karabash Copper Smelting Plant was founded by the English Joint Stock Company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the life of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmed began to change in 2004, after the company came under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the early days of July.
The head of the South Urals called the grandiose changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows capturing up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter redistribution.
Replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new workshop for cleaning industrial wastewater worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes allocated to the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominsky GOK project - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOK, the receipt of taxes to the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is successfully operating, the amount of deductions can be higher," Valery Ulanovsky added.
In 2015, tax deductions from the Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was a major overhaul, and in fact - an almost complete restructuring of kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in disrepair.
Also on the territory of RMK Arena there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

The picture was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the My Taganrog group on the social network VKontakte, which is why many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Azov Sea.
In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed a "budget tower" and a "mobile springboard."
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "blinking", and some drew attention to the fact that the man is seriously at risk of getting hurt when jumping from his tower, because he installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the picture.
“First, we do not know what depth there is, the beach can be bulky with a sharp descent by a meter right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters,” wrote the user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ.

WSJ: The United States is considering the imposition of sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
US officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the servers of the Democratic party, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
To impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to officially blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on the servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other American intelligence agencies are almost sure of Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that usually the United States prefers not to specify by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is made in 2014 by hacking the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, the responsibility for which was officially assigned to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyber attacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers acted with Russia’s support, they will need to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, the hackers of which hacked the servers of the national Committee of the Democratic party.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other applications along with the Google Play store.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, Deputy Head of FAS Alexey Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition must comply with all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further actions: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion "Echo of Moscow" was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s “Anime” Effect Criticized as a Caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially tactless.
With the help of the “Linsa” tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to match Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are rough, warping tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth and plump cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians — “yellow-faced.”
And they wondered whether these recurring controversies point to the company’s more serious diversity problem.
On Wednesday, reports spread and followed outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: The lens was intended as a homage to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photo tweet was actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least embarrassing.”
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very crude caricature of Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly derogatory yellow-faced.
Snapchat isn’t the only company going through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people at Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to wait to be understood.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said 25-year-old Katie Joo in an interview on Thursday, “this course of events is much more difficult to go unnoticed, as it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial controversies are the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the company’s mostly white management, consisting only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag: “DeleteSnapchat”.
As Zhu, who herself is an American of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they did not have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they do not occupy such positions in which it is possible to speak safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing frustration that Snapchat has not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its staff on Thursday, but according to a trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively try to engage domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us so they can say it won't work."
Military leaders have distorted intelligence about ISIS, according to a congressional commission
Officials from the U.S. Central Command altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than warrants events on the ground, a congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by the task force set up by Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who claim that the leaders were tampering with their assessments of U.S. actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the top command of Centcom tended to give a more optimistic portrayal of U.S. counterterrorism activities than confirmed by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable: When senior leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military suffers,” said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that constantly arose in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be falsified, it claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony in Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, that’s for sure,” Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior U.S. Central Command intelligence officials forged command documents to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans set up the task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been tampered with.
As the investigation progresses, a report released Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, not completed at the moment, investigation of the intelligence of the Centcom is conducted by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic Party representatives on the House Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed procedure for making intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraq’s security forces,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party’s top spokesman on the committee.
The procedure, Schiff said, “has stalled the release of intelligence documents,” damaged analysts’ morale, and “doesn’t sufficiently reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom analysts to tailor their findings to “a given or political interpretation.”
Preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by the Daily Beast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened after complaints by analysts of Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general’s investigation was ongoing.
But he said “experts sometimes disagree on the treatment of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics.”
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as more and more Defense Department officials now claim) is reaching its goal.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes a controversy more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, had come out in support of a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on Islamic State-owned oil refineries did not lead to a significant deterioration in the terrorist group’s financial standing because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then-commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate that many MPs deemed overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins four consecutive women’s field hockey games, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain
Once scoring three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the India team 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says that she is not sure if she would ever do something like this.
“I don’t have the mind,” she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of their goals.
Here’s what she knows: Americans score 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains undefeated after losing to Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Teams from the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will take second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little later, when the games of the quarter-finals begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her teammates.
The following year, Koaig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, a change in physical fitness," Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a throw from an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiralled into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in a tournament for U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” said Parkham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - "zen" jumps on the trampoline
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, this is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be constant and inevitable, it is a frantic combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself and there is that burning torch, which is transmitted from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or eavesdrop on your neighbors’ conversation one by one in a cafe and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympic contestant, a handsome man with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in prime time promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But 28-year-old Dooley from the city of Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic jumping competitions on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are those sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal bias, may I draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition in the past 16 years that many people I interviewed were unaware that they were Olympic sports at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the trampoline jump, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share male honors, while Chinese and Canadians share female honors.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have the charm of an outsider, in particular because for the unenlightened ear, they are more likely to be associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential — it’s a caricature of endless jumps — but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports they mostly combine.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word "el trampoljn", meaning "a springboard for jumping into the water".
Candidates to win jump on a giant trampoline, taking off into the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic stunts (turns, folds and flips) before finally landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They are aiming not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the cameras, for another tantalizing milestone: a world or Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But I think it’s a bit exhausting to watch the games.
He's giving the trampoline a break.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they certainly do not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy zeal for the finish line, no long jumps, only a wonderful, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women's qualifying competition and then final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; the men's one on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the daytime program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in a common landfill.
And if the rise in consciousness can be achieved only by subjecting male athletes to coveted views and objectifications — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested to male gymnasts from the United States — Dooley is just waiting for his new admiring crowd of fans.
"Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a staunch ally of the West with a booming economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly taken late last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they were placed with their hands against the wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it’s going to be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - opposition in the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that the dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that might change.
“If people are constantly being suppressed and left with no option but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints range from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After last year’s widely criticized election, the government party and its allies have completely supplanted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; fighting for this uncertain, contested border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, a few years boiling in the depths of the soul, flare up now.
The first, seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and Internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands thrived in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under one principle," said Mulato Gemezu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade, and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was especially adept at recognizing the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government stalled and then forged results.
During the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation for Ethiopia’s leaders’ visionary infrastructure development, such as a new long-distance train and significant gains in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal discontent with the government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhar, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigra hate on social media becomes all-encompassing.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has shut down the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
"And it will be hard to get through this tightrope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that swept his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people in a reasonable manner.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Expressing this assumption at a convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just freaking out.
The post was the exact opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and said that he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew widespread criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing messages that resonate with his fans, watching them act, and then explaining them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them in different ways.
Instead of softening his remarks to the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking released on Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado and coming on par with her in Florida.
While Trump typically tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the target of heightened scrutiny in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is one of Trump’s most prominent deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political commentary,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it not a threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most Republicans say that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop, because it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for unmasking his every word and bias against him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" television experts who are trying to solve it, and said, "They are weak!"
Some Democrats have derided Trump’s acquittals as too much evidence that he is unfit for president.
The once ousted coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verbe coffee shop was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsberg that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
Shop "Soup Sheri", which took the place of "Verbe" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in the renewed city.
New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap shop.
But while New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new "Verbe" has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verba" is Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot of things in their original form.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verbe".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu features sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and capers or fried onions are available.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he was paying attention to the steady flow of old loyal customers.
“Many former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsberg with prices,” he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsberg and frequented the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and atmosphere that impressed me at Verbe,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to the Verb since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like clockwork, I would come and make my bagel with butter and all the stuffing for me,” he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but one day he will change something with bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffing.
Rodriguez said that he did not resent the fact that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soap Sheri offered to make a special soap for Verbe, using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also chose this coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the shop window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice point plans to bottle and sell coffee made cold.
There is a possibility that the coffee house will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verbe" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular client and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new location, Witt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“I’ve wanted to smell it for a long time,” he said.
Depressive food depression in the "Dense meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue's trendy dishes, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - prune pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
Koua’s latest book, “The Chinese Rug,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book, The Fruit Garden House 97.
Their new collaborative work, The Dense Meal, which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flatiron neighborhood that has been running since 1929, the year of the Stock Crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
"The rolls were in great demand," Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed you to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe frowned.
“He was probably lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "Dense meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, uneasy topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as uneasy was the new budget ration: mysterious dishes such as rolls and casseroles became staple foods; casseroles were “a great way to dispose of the scraps,” Siegelman said, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, for many years the basis of American food, has become a cost-effective luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter is completely unsuitable for baked onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
More than ever before, home economics professionals — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers”, to accept the challenge and to transform burda like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
“Dense meal” is a feast of interesting historical facts.
Especially poignant are the stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “let them eat pies.”
Publicly extolling the simple farming routine of Iowa during his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, and this led to the fact that the White House “consumed not only the dullest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.”
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelman says, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Siegelman's mother - that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, "She really poisoned people."
There was an unpleasant case with the spoilers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe took out a dessert they had made at home: a prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a prune mousse," Siegelman said, adding that it was common to give modest recipes catchy names.
There were no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife: “A little chopped walnuts would not hurt here.”
Arrest of defendants in the case of a mass brawl in the Khovan cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest the defendants in the case of a mass brawl in the Khovanskoye cemetery, having granted the relevant petition of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 in the Khovan cemetery there was a mass brawl of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, as a result of which three people were killed.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization “Healthy Nation” Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters on how much we need to raise the pension in order to offset the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are done.
Now economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks,” Golodets said.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Research Alexei Kudrin to increase the retirement age for six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the finals of the shooting competition with a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan made it to the finals of the shooting competition with a small-caliber rifle from a lying position at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 was.
In total, eight best athletes went to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt,” French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gulen as saying.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if at least some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
Istanbul court earlier arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempt of a military coup occurred in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of advocacy services during a dispute over a patent for hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the costs of attorney services it incurred in a lawsuit over a hepatitis C drug patent with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck’s patents related to Gilead’s medicines, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical acts.
In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. federal district court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
US-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State claimed $3 million in revenue from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited a State Tax Service audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate's declarations.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of the inspections.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans in 2012, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and released an online video on Friday that focused on prominent Republicans urging Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: release his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist for the New York Times on Friday cited many tax lawyers and accountants who believe that perhaps things are still going on.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is under scrutiny by the IRS, and that Trump is “afraid” not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with Chili Powder and Fireworks Increase Protection for Tanzanian Elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into populated areas - throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Committee on Nature Conservation, took over its promotion, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, with the result that they are much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the breaking elephant and signal with the horn.
If he failed to scare away, they throw the so-called “chili cloud”.
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a clap in the condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick remains outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a bang, spraying fine dust of chili powder into the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who left the country after a coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 career diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the Turkish foreign minister said.
In July, an attempted coup took place in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military officials of the highest and middle levels.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people died, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
A Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s phone code at the “request” of the Arabs, RT News reported.
A French director of Jewish origin has unleashed a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code on its list, with employees citing “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel on the hotel’s phone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to dial Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel’s reception.
The response he received there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by Kempinski's hotel chain."
The reason behind this move caused even more anger of the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed,” Lanzman, a hotel official, said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “terrible shame,” according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is even more shameful.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "went over" the alleged claims of Arab clients.
“We would be ashamed,” another post said, which stated that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, is located next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident an “inspection” and “apologizing” to Lanzman, the newspaper Der Spiegel reports.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel on the quick dial list,” a Kempinski spokesman told the newspaper.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Riots began when police tried to disperse the students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% - RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is an increase in interest from Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are poised to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which preserve the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the instructions of the general director of the Almaz-Antey concern, “missing work” and “loss of trust”.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed as the head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public sphere.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (MIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the point of view of restoring order in the industry.
Almaz is the parent company of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea-based and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems.
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, there have not been any truly successful trials in several years of testing.
However, as far as I can tell, this is not the unequivocal fault of Almaz,” Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense system.
Development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is being planned and everything will be completed in time", although in 2014 the Ministry acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that delays in projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, likes silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave their positions at their own will, under an agreement between the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it did not receive resonance.
This suggests that the head of the "Diamond" was, perhaps, a figure of shrewdness and resisted descending from the top of the "dresses".
Apparently, the state no longer intends to put up with such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will exclude those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the stolen managers (the fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings devoted to rearmament.
The Kremlin is protecting the ranks of defense industry managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal staff of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleansing” of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying “If you want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s military might and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
This is evidenced by the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, perhaps there is not a single quiet corner.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scottish Callum Skinner races on the finish line, causing the British to capture bicycle gold
Scottish Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, resulting in the UK team trio defending their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly went down in history, rushing along the finish line to snatch the victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the rights to the surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy has since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant’s specialist Jamie Staff.
They did so just when Hindes came along.
Hoi's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was adhered to by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny — champions with Hoy four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes was riding on more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling on the track after a failed start.
He later retracted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK rivals.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We’ve all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many races with a world name that to win the Olympics again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it's not beyond the possibility of imagining him repeating Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Moe Farah and Roger Bannister) — bring his score to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be like Hoi's.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played over three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win by yourself, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-kilometre pursuit team race of four.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set when winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In a related women's event that resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roesell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Kathy Archibald of Milngavie improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
Team Britain has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After actually exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations waned in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not the last - the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening at the velodrome, it seems that the now legendary glory of Great Britain in reaching the tops at the right time may just happen again.
The future of the Portland steel plant is under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies provided to support the plant’s operation.
A fixed subsidy of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down a steel plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the Englesie power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland steel plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called “hedged contracts”, which were supposed to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017,” the company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s earnings since fiscal 2018 is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in view of the “forecoming termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a steel plant or provide electricity to a steel plant.”
The American company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL’s chief operating officer Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has been featured at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of “Kardashyan Family?”), prepared a reality video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshiri Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them as the universally favorite uncle of show business, producer of “Kardashyan Family” Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the cover, and they planned a turn.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to the birthday (Cicrest says the phrase: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 am), but Chris needed this fame to somehow get to other girls.
Because with this episode, dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian Show.
Although Kendall Kim's older sister may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
Thicker than a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages from last year’s 832-page issue contained advertising).
News of which of the stars will be on his cover is expected with such impatience that in the last two years the photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who work as models" than "models who are celebrities."
The Academy Award winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine described as the “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she’s in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, in view of her past star of a reality TV show, always had to remain shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitch of the moment."
These sentiments were again stirred up after the news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there is no point in focusing on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own applications, available on a paid subscription.
She sells hand-made photos of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the world’s most vulnerable are denied service in public legal centers as the sector prepares for an effect that will further reduce funding for activities already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been refused, trying to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating beyond capacity are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Director of Queensland Public Law Centers James Farrell said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people a year have been refused.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision was not overturned, the situation would only get worse.
“The Queensland Public Law Centers are consistently underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unfairly laid off workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to tackle complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Secretary and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Palaschuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s campaign was sued: allegedly, the headquarters did nothing after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized "it won't happen."
Director Earl Phillip "pulled out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional administration of the campaign headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal states.
"Pistols don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after a Republican presidential candidate made a splash, telling listeners in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" — understood as gun owners and his fans — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and able to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for negligent control, and from Phillip - for the threat of physical violence, insulting the action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County High Court Division (Charlotte).
Britain must put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
To me, it was just that huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we did our best to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just a small circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from the T5 — chosen as the best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK and I’m sure Heathrow expansion will be, too.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trading future and building a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attaché
Adblock Plus, Facebook are playing cat-and-mouse on the issue of blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a cat-and-mouse game, according to one company that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of just how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe survey; nearly four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article for Facebook to consider such a step as a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced it was going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are a concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we’ve instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people’s hands.
Woman Moved on Swiss Highway in Violent Suicide Episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after the woman was moved by several vehicles on the freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 near the Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark “in a gesture of desperation” and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers involved have already been interviewed, but the identity of some is still unknown, police said, calling on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve said.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a hit?
That’s what the prosecutor should determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the freeway — it was ruled that motorists could not expect a chance encounter with a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on an A1 near Pyern on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that the female police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near the Morges should call the police at 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus was Once Habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists from the Nasov Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for exploring the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have conditions similar to Earth’s.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotation rate is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a rarefied atmosphere similar to Earth’s and still spin slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had more arid regions than Earth, but once it had enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus substitutes its daytime side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella to protect the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures that, surprisingly, are a few degrees cooler than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/CEO Joe Sakick confirmed the news and said the club would start looking for a new manager immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as Colorado Avalanche’s head coach and vice president of hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a voice in decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakick said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs the last two years.
Team Avalanche announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second preferential ticket to participate in the Western Conference.
A goaltender from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and with the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Resume Talks and Suspend Strike
Workers’ strikes over North Sea oil workers’ wages have been suspended and all sides are embarking on a new round of talks, leading officials said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes," the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Trade unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cut came after a 10 percent rate cut for contract employees working ashore in 2014.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for crude oil: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that have emerged in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotation speeds of stars entering the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation correlate with the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Louise Riball, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, said in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on stars.
As a star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball likens stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades Ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster are usually very light stars,” Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotation speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their “dancing shoes” to the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades' rotation speeds in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, Kommersant reports.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenia, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcers believe that not all accomplices of saboteurs could be detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 world Cup.
On August 11, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous football player who previously played in Moscow “Spartak” as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as all the same “Spartak”, “Pearl-Sochi”, “Terek”, “Amkar”, “Dynamo”, as well as Warsaw “Legia”, which became the winner of the national championship and the Cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who falls under the obligation to prepare the national team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panicov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian national team to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - this will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team on themselves.
Nestled between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to “recover costs”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country’s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of income inequality, dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also declined, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is made up of human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, as commodity prices fall, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of assessment, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the upper-middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbors, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, enriching the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production facilities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of the country’s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and production contracts to make sure this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why the government’s strong support for free speech is so important.
As noted by the head of state Hage Geingob, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial site, known as Grave No. 43, recovered 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon move to a nondescript-looking bead, found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite of the Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a gold strip folded into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiyev, the head of the excavations at Tella Yunazita, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it is older than Varna gold by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
Technologies that allow to date metal with perfect accuracy do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I am quite sure that Yunacite gold is older than Varna gold.”
This is an extremely important find: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiyev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with as much accuracy as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
At present, Tell Yunacite is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the next centuries, metal processing developed rapidly in this region, from mastering the first metallurgical skills to creating a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to appear around metalworking centers.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunacite a prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” says Boyadzhiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia — modern Iraq.
There appeared the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
Excavations of Tell Yunacite have been conducted since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
Little remains of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, the "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunacite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds were found here.
All birds are depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local worship.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but horses and guns.
The three-meter walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: inside the houses were found the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the “gold of Varna”, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna’s golden opulence should have been preceded by something like a tiny golden bead created in Tell Yunacita.
Porsche has artificially aged model 911 Targa
Officially, it is stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the division who work with serial machines.
"Retro bow" is, for example, in a special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the model Porsche 356B - in this color even the logo of the model is painted.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some body design details painted in "white and gold metallic".
In the interior, retro drawings are much less: it differs, by and large, the gray-blue range of design, new seats with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed with black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the division.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists Porsche Exclusive did not touch: retro-targa on the characteristics quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers launched an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the concealment of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked the developers of solutions to block advertising for response actions.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote”, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “non-blockable” advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook has expressed regret over this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network publication TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook, will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected side were users who missed interesting records from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated recently.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court - Vecherniy Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015 the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia the Fengguang 370 crossover and the Rich New pickup - the site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the increasingly popular class of cars in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another declared Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting innovations to our motorists in the near future, will act as a powerful front.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current exchange rate).
Russians such a price tag is unlikely to shine, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 by the results of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic body kit on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be considered as crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla" on the center console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossover, and cars with "music" were on sale simpler.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading pad with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum trunk volume is 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a sparing budget for the owner of appetite at the level of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is familiar to Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly ennobled Chinese stylists design.
Despite the outdated design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 liters (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 liters (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected "front".
There will be a Dongfeng stand and a new flagship A9 sedan, its Russian premiere, the representative office of the Chinese company announced in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme unchanged for years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the taxpayer" on the official website of the department nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, “paper” mailing list.
The novelty will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, there is an opportunity to return to the old scheme and the owners of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal cabinet" immediately after the compilation, while the letter will go for several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed procedure.
Some could register in the "personal cabinet" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notification by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal Account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that in the current year, the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which improvements are aimed at achieving very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took on a modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sledgehammer with the aerodynamics of the tank and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Inflating the "muscles" of a crazy "helika", the masters took advantage of the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight".
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying “brick” is capable of a breakthrough in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from medium speeds probably give it much better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km / h, the tuning all-terrain vehicle with a deactivated electronic “collar” is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR with a dimension of 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach announced a striking conceptual coupe with a length of 6 m, which will be presented in the framework of the contest of elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, at least four environmentally friendly innovations are expected to appear.
