Parliament does not support the amendment giving freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Its ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya's victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary law of Shariah, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the punishment for theft is cutting off the hand.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society composed of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
However, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best, and most likely would not suit, for example, the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, the NATO raids were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in gunfights, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, need not worry about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Without the occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold for almost nothing?
Most likely, they will not, and the West will finally be able to boast of unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shari'ah put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
Statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, Germany and France are showing growth.
And yet the debt market today is breaking records.
Investors are no longer only looking towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (initial information assumed stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, GDP stagnated compared to the previous quarter. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth in comparison with the previous quarter by 0.2%, which coincides with the forecasts of analysts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bond yield is 28.45%.
The yield of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
Czech national team has been selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with a score of 1: 0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chech and the beautiful goal of Pyotr Jiracek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the home return match, and she will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
Czech national team, partly due to team defeat at the end; great Czech; and heroic Jiracek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates reaching the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucic were the most unsuccessful pair of matches after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr Cech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thereby earn about 200 million CZK.
From the first minutes, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty with the combinations; the game was mostly in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Long-range strikes over the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
At noon on Tuesday, students' prayers before entering the building were followed by a prayer for the deaths of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
Thus, they demonstrated their readiness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) pointed out that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
At noon on Tuesday, student prayers before entering the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by a prayer for the deaths of both the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of school children are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see again the importance of the environment and the behaviors that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate French fries for dinner on the eve of a survey relating to an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not play sports. This, however, applies to the majority of families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time to play sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 elementary school students across Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Véobecnj zdravotnj pojijovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students of grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determining factors that cause a rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day, according to the scheme of breakfast-dinner-lunch-dinner-dinner, and this is one of the indispensable conditions for proper nutrition,” says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even such relative details as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school children eat breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst finding is that one in ten families doesn’t have breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study showed that fried foods are more often consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly play sports, this figure is reduced by more than half - up to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Food preferences in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"Of particular concern is the great popularity of sweet soft drinks," the study concludes.
As the main dining dish, the pasta defeated the bird with a small margin.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetable dishes.
The pursuit of a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are ready to change their eating habits, provided that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study’s control group showed a significant shift in preferences toward healthy eating when they filled out a questionnaire after completing a lecture on Obesity is not an accident,” the project said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them to just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children were more likely to celebrate poultry and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about trainings for stylists, I lamented the amount of information at the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lectures by three experts in the field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
Next is more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there are no men on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the owners of a more lush chest and hips and a narrow waist, and not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so great that you can not pick up a skirt or trousers, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will definitely not regret the money invested, since perfectly seated clothes are priceless.
In a skirt made to order, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, rolls, exposes the waist, etc.
Holders of boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruches, appliques, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize it.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant of the courses had to come up with two outfits for some celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I’m going to wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know from Victoria’s Secret advertising campaigns.
I am happy for myself because it is much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered by a ton (please keep in mind that I am exaggerating), or very young Selena Gomez.
We must cut clothes from magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard - the so-called result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic component of the style.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashionable bags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday's lecture, rich with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one piece of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, over jeans and T-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without fasteners like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
In any case, I most appreciated the following advice: “For your work, you must know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start to break them," Yakub told us.
Here I finally understood why we cram all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review of ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the garment often looks and works in combination with others in a completely different way than in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look - a second time).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to name us a different (less) size than the one they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about the fact that some celebrity got fat / lost weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up an outfit.
Our job is mainly to communicate with the people we dress; so it’s important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them and hold their opinion.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things that you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a work bag should hold.
This is a bag that you tie around the waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should be nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (bumps and similar items are prohibited as they spoil the clothes) or a sewing set.
In order to distract from lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to properly make linings on the soles of shoes.
Even while filming in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting outdoors.
And here we are, sticking.
You don’t have to touch the shoes with scissors to not spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t so easy no matter what you say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute due to a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambitions have been met to some extent, but that doesn’t matter because no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Escape" there were high hopes.
It was expected to shift the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take a worthy place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, a lot of things are different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by several unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of the story, the main character of which, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
There is no feeling that the same thing happens in the game all the time.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to look at.
And yet the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm, significantly reducing visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
Individual races are pretty well-ordered.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while, you try to overtake a few opponents (essentially a normal race); then you try to improve time (a standard stopwatch race); or you compete against one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time you come across the police, which further complicates your task.
The components outside the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's no big deal.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out to be good for the game because it’s a property that doesn’t get bored; given all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you are looking for an imitation of real life, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although better options can be found on the market.
So far, it's very good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not as good.
From such a game you do not expect difficult transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before the collision with the object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another car slightly. And yet, sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car begins to unwind wildly.
Or smashed to shreds.
It’s not that important thanks to the restart system, but it’s enough to spoil the fun.
Restarts are designed so that if you crash or get far away from the track, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you’ll have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work out, but you can’t completely rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race by heart.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a specific location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily drive between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you find yourself there, the cars are already positioned so that you either need to go around them or lose speed.
It doesn’t matter when you find yourself next to them; everything is arranged in such a way that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is that when he rides in front of you, he worsens your view, which leads to one or more accidents at this site.
One can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-filled, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
It’s a shame because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so eventful that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on around you.
It doesn’t matter what makes you bored — a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races, or anything else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to track gas stations along the way, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases, the one that you already have is quite enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for straight stretches of highway; and exotic super-sports cars for technical driving, for example, along curved mountain slopes.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; these are races on individual sites that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to challenges and story modes.
Many features are available to get a higher level of driving: from machines to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another drawback that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (we’ll assume it is) where you race on the rails in the dark (we’ll assume it is).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s assume that this is the case) when suddenly a subway train comes on you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editorial board discussed whether no one really thought for a second during the creation of the game, or its creators really consider us such fools.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video sequence is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments the quality of recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true for events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'entered compositions from different styles'; but hardly many people will buy the game because of its music.
Need for Speed: Escape is pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, this is a good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the flaws will blind you like an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation of detractors and skeptics against the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
“It will take five or six years before the situation somehow stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vitsenova rigidly began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how she adhered to her motto “Clearly and openly about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual institutions of the EU and the relationship between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the KU would envy.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse that couldn’t perform any role; I have to say everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, communicate with them perfectly and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative on foreign and security affairs as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on the program, which is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful presidency of the Czech Republic in the year before.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czechs are very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing ferment.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be meager and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will receive less; all these issues are in the upcoming program.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, Intelligible Language”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our varieties of cheese?
It is also going to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says: 'Hey, what about the meeting, the Visegrad group again?' and he is not even a little happy about it.
In the future, the Union expects mostly new strict rules for the budget policy of the member states.
Compared with the new European Federation, she considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that do not want to, can stay away.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” expects Vicenova.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member states, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be “durable.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid down by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says the current head of the company, Samuel J. Palmizano, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way that Batja in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for top inventors and entrepreneurs.
IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers is similarly advanced.
From the very beginning, the company found brilliant applications for talented people. It was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which provided it with an excellent choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometty, will succeed Palmisano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming sessions, during which many future innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
A strong position of the company in business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Forrester Research’s Joe Coloni.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
For a hundred years, IBM, or the “Blue Giant”, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a diskette.
With $ 220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place - Apple), ahead of Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all of its products came to the liking of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is driven by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundations on multiple platforms — if they don’t work, it abandons them.
This differs, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Promising technology
IBM’s main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth coming from computer programs and hardware in each case.
Whereas in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, while it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was hit for the first time by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net income has been constantly growing.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM History: From Cheese Knife to Space Flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Calculating, Tabulating, Recording Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924. It was originally called the brand, which was used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They owned technology, such as the legendary "table clock", i.e. clocks that record the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the board of trustees of the company until 1930.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the head pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unshakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacture and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years in office, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the chair of the director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control spaceflights — to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 — the human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the consulting department of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make reasonable use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research group also operates.
Rikhtarzhova about his unfaithful husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rikhtarzhova (53) said that it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarzh (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has outlined clear rules for her future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not as my partner,” explained Rikhtarzhova.
When Darina Rikhtarzhova provided Bartoshova with shelter in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rzhychan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In fact, he admitted publicly that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now finally said goodbye to him.
Richtarge doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if one day Richtarj and Bartoshov break up, his wife will not accept him with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out."
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something in common," said Rikhtarzhova, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am in charge of repairs, garden, home and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we don't share a bed anymore," Richtarge told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rikhtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and whether she has a friend.
I know it’s my fault, I’ve fallen in love with Yveta and I’m fully responsible,” concluded Joseph.
Worst Female Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your other half complain that you shop all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who among you will refuse to walk around the clothing stores in search of perfectly seated clothes and trying it on (preferably in different color options) in the fittings?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Eternal Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you enter a group of women obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints about their partner’s appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, dust cleaning, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; kids for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a living room window glass that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that going to extremes is not good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not be in the first place.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
The desire to command
"Put your clothes in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, they may find it very bothersome.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps, if men understood this, women would not have to command them so often.
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult and weave intrigues against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
Every once in a while, we're probably all gossiping.
Let’s be honest, that’s the nature of all women.
Be that as it may, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's work collective, are a great danger to their environment.
The successful transmissions of Yagra and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two assists hockey striker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the ice of Carolina. He again became the most productive Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists of the match also belonged to Yakub Vorachek, who played in the same team.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Giroud.
“I told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick.
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," explained Jagr, after whose actions Giroud scored a goal at the first opportunity that the Flyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a “Czech trace”.
Closing Hurricanes Voracek took possession of the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the laps.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap at numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, the Flyers again led.
Especially Giroud.
After Yagra's effective pitching, he scored a third goal; his kick was later converted to a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his centre-back.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I sped up, and Reed went to the far end."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the team Montreal Czech Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomasz Plecanets could not score during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was upset by a large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“We can’t do anything about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement by replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added defender P.K. Subban.
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjaj Pavelec helped the Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets goals, which interrupted a five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned travel agencies were allowed to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Zédok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was strictly limited, travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balato).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from this country was necessary; otherwise an individual journey was impossible.
At that time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but it was necessary either to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permission was necessary for trips to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit, it was impossible to obtain funds (Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most often, the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989 we were not able to freely visit the most popular Croatia at the present time, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to the neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not be satisfied with traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring your own food (canned food, salami, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech krona. After decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air travel has now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries, except the United States. This made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. Great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights bring Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country, thus, forever joined the most developed world countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during vacations abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general meeting must choose the president, the threat of the pat returns
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAQR) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindrzych Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Patzlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gasek resigned from his post in June. Leaving, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
However, the Gasek era has again plunged football into contention between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
Delegates to the general meeting came in vain to the National House in Prague, Smichov, as negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the general meeting - only the legal representatives or also the officials who were granted the powers.
This point has since been partly settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Council also did not help very much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly engaged in this issue.
Ideas about how to vote have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the path?
"The debate is whether to follow the established norms or find another model," says one of FA-R vice-presidents Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who received great support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider the candidate with the largest number of votes in both houses to be the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the overall percentage of the winner must get at least two-thirds of the vote.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers," Liberty agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Patzlik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates, the election rules determined by the charter suit Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held according to the charter as much as possible."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representative stupidity, as in the previous general meeting," says owner Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he mostly contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburk; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
“All emotional ferment will calm down after today’s expected release of the national team in the European Championship.”
"Football will be happy again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says Yablonets representative. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
"It's not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another disruption to the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, some negotiations were held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to deliver, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucheru and Reichl to Podgorica, did not take off from Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
At the end of the day, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opposing parties in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and a planned general meeting of STV with a new Czech sports directorate after Saska's financial troubles.
Patzlik enters the presidential struggle, because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football players Plzen Tomasz Patzlik would see a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAQR), he would not even claim a high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But such a person has not yet been found," said Patzlik.
Patzlik's motive for joining the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindrjih Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the supposed election favorite, from taking over FAQR.
Moreover, Patzlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken by an experienced top manager who is not too connected with football life.
"I've talked to a few people who could be kept in mind."
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football.
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Patzlik and Pelta is connected with the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbr, president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berbr is a man of contradictory reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the votes of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik thus considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
“If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward.”
“With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football,” said Patzlik.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago, Pelta's name was recorded while tapping phones in a corruption investigation; Pelta managed to avoid a conviction.
"I don't know what kind of prestige a Pelta victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik. He now does not mention his previous statement that he will "sell the club Plzen if Pelta becomes president."
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could present a collaboration with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would turn to."
'He's very capable.'
“I can imagine him leading the team.”
"But he can't run the association."
"I don't get a nose for things I don't understand either," said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he backed the removal of the Ludec Matsela-led judiciary team, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patslick claims he will risk running the association.
He cites his experience in running private companies; since last summer, he has managed the Pilsen team, which with his help celebrated its first league triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"To limit the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appellate council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Patzlik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA-R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key things a new president should be doing.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Patzlik does not consider his association with the Plzen club to be a burden, although he argues that the FAQR president should be independent.
The pelta is connected with the Jablonec, and the Reichl with the Prague Dukla.
"It's not the ideal option."
“And yet I don’t see the point in hypocritically handing over my Plzen shares to someone else, since I’m going to be back there in six months,” Patzlik says.
Pelta has promised new rules FA-R, which will avoid Elective Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FA-R rules in order to avoid disputes over election rules in the future.
Before the talks on Thursday in Nimburka, Yablonetsa’s official remains an optimist and believes that attention from the election campaign will significantly distract today’s expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and receiving funds.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas regarding football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to become known on Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to lead the association," says a man mostly affiliated with the Jablonec club; but he has spent many years at Sparta and the association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gasek.
"Unfortunately, rules that weren't as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June."
"If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He treated the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will take it personally and I’m going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist,” says Pelta.
In addition, he says that he does not try to distinguish himself from rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindrjih Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's had some success.
"However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
"Even so, some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football,” the forty-six-year-old candidate said two months ago.
Then he promised that his election to the post of football head would not entail dismissal of staff.
"I will need to learn the job descriptions of individual employees." This was his message to the Insurer, where the prolonged period of inter-authority causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday delegates will come to Nimburk not in vain.
“If the only question is how to hold the election in the third round, we can handle it.”
“Football needs the trust it can get by finally electing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before a key day in his career as a functionary.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA-R will begin to work actively
If Jindrich Reichl, acting vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association at a meeting on Thursday, many people in the association are rumored to be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas in football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; raise more money in football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gasek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and football events for young people".
“I don’t want to say that I’ll do it myself,” Reichl said in an interview with .TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I will carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments football makes great strides forward.
“It’s probably not going to please a lot of people, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any sense in it; and that I won't be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
“However, a lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others will come.”
"It's a trust I can't give up," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gasek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to override it.”
"There have been processes that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to the one before Gasek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent for."
"He is surrounded by people who would play football in a way that is only accessible to the elite."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for subjectivity.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
"While many people are trying to argue otherwise, I plan to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Pilsen club manager Tomasz Patzlik entered the presidential fight, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his successes, he attributes the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiations on contracts with television and negotiations on the law on the lottery.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another opponent, Patzlik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Pilsen this year."
“If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gasek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
“He wouldn’t distort the facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try out the incredible water of Europe - and relax a tired body in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing Iris Meder could not do during his research trips for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building and the history of the building.
Architecture historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools - and has now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing), which includes everything from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Townus.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" led her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true bath culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, Meder says, but the water is different.
The only drawback is that fans of swimming should put up with the blue tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the alluring smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the refined oils in the sauna are such a significant health factor in the baths, because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes, if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and jumps.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joy of Bathing contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump into the water.
Water collector Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolc) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (the V?rosi Term?lf?rd? in Jasberen), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest.
From many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offers a stunning view. You can see all of Zurich from the rooftop pool or view the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And in the steam room there is a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld. The aqua cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem very small against the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder, a collector of pools, did not smell chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur. Baths named Arpada in Bekeshab smell so much oil that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a wellness source.
The smell is caused by carbonates in alkaline water. The water is almost black from silt, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a wellness experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at some point was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places. When she tried to visit the outdoor swimming pool of the Czech Baths in Lugacovici, she found the area sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the views of the red-white-yellow building in the Art Nouveau style, she saw weeds growing between tiled tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on a hot trail is the amazing swimming pool in the Black Forest - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will find not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she hails from the Black Forest.
“It’s a real achievement to combine such different architectural styles in such a masterful way,” says Meder.
To dive into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann gave a task to the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study builds on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harold Schumann, demonstrates that betting on world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is aimed directly at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade similarly.
Initially, bets on goods were intended as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and profit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism. He promised to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade "is worth risking Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Managing Directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decline or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Thilo Bode was pleased with the news, emphasizing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "Betting on rising food prices is a blatant example of how reckless banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“Deutsche Bank should remove from the portfolio all investments that make cash bets on food prices,” said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his tenure in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
Eliminating controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little to no need to worry about costs - with consequences his successor will have to deal with.
Every second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take specific steps if they found their bank involved in such trading. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to speculation in goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and a happy ending. Austria's pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold which expressed a belief in technological progress.
Schwanzer's Pavilion won the Architecture Grand Prix in 1958 for its lightweight soaring steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
He eventually rose to fame around the world in 1973 with his legendary BMW four-cylinder tower and her sister, the bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna got a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and his condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has now renovated the pavilion, which has been named “21st Century House” and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum, a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening, is a joyous event in every sense.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and made a decision on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to accommodate a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with contemporary art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an exceptionally important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems that arose in the last restructuring were much more serious. The building was a "energy absorber," Krishanitz says.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a glass-enhanced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel bars of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building but still an elegant Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would be approved by the museum management,” Krishanitz says, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite limitations, challenges and transformations.
Krishanitz noted recently that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical history of "drops in the city".
Such an architecture is “always out of place” and yet wants to “stimulate real awareness.”
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, as unexpected luck has happened when planning the city. A completely redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The 21st century house may be complemented by a second Krishanitz building - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly in talks with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-millionth winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn’s internal anti-crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that investments totaling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
The investment is intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and involved employees involved in snow removal from tracks and platforms will be doubled, to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before work and 90 percent of the required hands within four to five hours.
Ruediger Grube, the head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellations and delays of trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE axles much more frequently for years after one of the ICE trains broke the axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds fine in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds.
Like Deutsche Bank had few problems at home, the past of the industrial giant in the US has now caught up with it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to calm disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds plummeted during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are pleased to have resolved this issue without bringing the parties to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
In the agreement, the bank pleaded not guilty.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the swift response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for the billions of dollars in losses.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer brought a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are backed by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when the US real estate bubble burst in 2007.
American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the U.S. are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, demanding to pay compensation or punish fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for Housing Finance (FHFA).
It accuses 18 of the largest international banks of having purchased approximately $200 billion in collateral from U.S. lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also facing the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt-headquartered bank to take responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unsubstantiated and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investments were regarded as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of “Sir IBM”.
In an interview with the American business TV channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he has purchased shares of IBM for a total of $ 10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said that even IBM, until recently, knew nothing about his participation.
He praised the management that managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has been focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers for a long time.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He claimed that he invests only in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in rail freight, lubricants and mechanical engineering.
His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher R?ck), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with the help of skilful investments, built on it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
IBM's stock price rose one percent before the markets opened after Buffett's investment announcement.
The “blue giant”, as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, which makes it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The imminent danger
After the identification of the “cell in Zwickau”, the Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has raised long-forgotten fears. There have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the arson attacks in Mello in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of such a scale that it is not yet fully realized.
"Revival of the Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of an online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant for the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may find themselves embroiled in a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket across the street from the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin, at a ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the employment of labor.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap in the face. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of H?rriyet also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"Begins to smell bad" is the title of Ahmet Kulahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
Police conduct and the subsequent successful round-up were sharply criticized at German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought earlier about keeping an eye on suspicious individuals in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached quite a sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act just as clumsily, migrants will have no choice but to armed self-defense."
"It will be the best self-defense."
“Peace in Germany depends very much on how the whole network is opened and on the legality of punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in Melln and Solingen in the 1990s were an example of the fact that peace in Germany was under threat.
A photo of the burned ruins in Solingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has so clearly shown the Turks living here that they are in danger, and the Germans - that distrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mello.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the President of Turkey after the burnings in Solingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech and calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany.
It is as if he determined the value of a person by the taxes that he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media again showed how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis or the other ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber probably did not suspect that he would get this role.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he will begin work in an equally spectacular post - the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better".
“I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.
But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the post of chairman of the board in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He’s an economics professor and a central bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he’ll certainly need time to adjust.
He was suddenly responsible for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that it has long earned the title of “the largest banking scandal in Europe.”
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently, he managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other - does not get out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not spare anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a secretive and sustainable, but at the same time agile asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in management of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, he joined the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always cited my UBS students as an example of a good bank.”
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong."
He was really very wrong.
It wasn’t until 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley — who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker — abruptly stepped down from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported a 13 billion Swiss franc increase in capital to counter the crisis.
The bank did manage to find investors — but investors that many bankers would have politely turned down until recently — one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so secretive that even its name was not reported.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel - the second-highest-paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster struck. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was in danger of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased an undisclosed amount of billions of toxic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks settled in a small country.
After all, UBS’s final balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland’s production (see chart).
“We can’t save UBS a second time,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and said that it was ready to transfer data of wealthy customers who, perhaps, with the help of the bank, evaded taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of refunds of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus admitted more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich customers - the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as it used to be.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The customer’s money has started.
Over the course of several months, the bank has lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - in investing due to failed speculation and in asset management as a result of assistance and encouragement of tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it began to seem that UBS managed to turn the situation around, as happened this disaster with a scammer-trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it does not have a tool for controlling risks.”
Caution has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world outside the Alpine republic has collapsed or not.
Safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprungli symbolize a refined taste in chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still conforms to the image of a decent Swiss private bank - only it is a little more.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on the Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snowcaps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprngli, you can find jewelry companies such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been around for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls there are large leather sofas. Next to the bank emblem is a large sign "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need, reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at one point abandoned Swiss notions of banking — or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is anything, it means that they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost so much money in the jungle of subprime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country's history," Lucas Hessig wrote in his book The Crash of UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger - and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but steppe bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, executive director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wolffly and Ospel are the dream team,” says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at a bank."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember board meetings where Wolffley always repeated the same slogan: move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "tournament table", where the successes of banks were made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to walk part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. By that parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To plug the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. subprime securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them further - continuing to carry the risks themselves.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” Geiger said.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have turned into a children's game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
Anyone who heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has an idea - to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about their Swiss roots.
The bank, however, (yet) is not ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that investment activities need to be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only seen as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
Since then, he has managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on an ongoing basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It is cutting 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly, he only said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe pull down the American stock exchange
The looming recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis could be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty — but now problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 percent.
The market barometer during trading fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 countries of the euro area has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
Eurostat reported that in September, companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
This message plunged American investors into skepticism. "We're not on the island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to quickly shake up the recession and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The price of shares of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of its remaining stake in the Construction Bank of China, raking in $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital quota with net profit from the sale in order to comply with stricter regulations.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing won by reducing losses at the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 series aircraft with a total value of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, the total is actually $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares have changed ownership on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
Shares of 630 companies ended the trading with growth, 1913 with a fall and 82 remained at the same level on Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart crows fill cities
Rattles are considered problem birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will not be able to drive out of cities.
Some like birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining about dirt and noise are becoming more and more in many settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposia dedicated to crows, in the city of Lehr in East Frisia, experts argued that the rooks could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially protected rooks, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Jever, Deepholz, Achim near Bremen and Lera there are large colonies with more than 600 parent pairs.
A controversial crow-shooting project in Lera caused disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics have described trapping birds and hammering them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"Ordinary displacement and intimidation do nothing," said architect and landscape designer Werner Clover of Lehr.
Collapsing nests with a jet of water or cutting trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Wurttemberg.
"Animals disperse, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only as an exception next to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, - says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Koelner.
A combination of deterring birds from needing protection in residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a solution.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" - was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the life of very clever beggars is given on information stands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about the noise produced by birds. "Noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and ingenuity of these birds are included in the legends. Roaches often not only use tools to take possession of the piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of the bird’s mind on four rooks.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the board to get the moth larva.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, clever rooks had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket of moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to hook the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players managed this on their first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks to win at the last minute were not held up for a long time.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last places in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1), perfecting their fifth Euro exit after 0-0 in the first stage.
Czech was 1-0 (0-0) in the second round of the playoffs against an outsider Montenegro after a net victory in the first round (2-0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0-0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily achieved a score of 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the rest of the goals for Portugal.
Former professional Bundesliga player from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spahic reduced the difference by two points thanks to an effective penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at Lisbon's Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, striking a free kick in the gate from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, increasing the score from 25-meter mark to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half hour, got their first opportunity thanks to striker Edin Jacko.
Former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yirachek scores for Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Poshtigo in the Bosnians' penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing with his hand after foul Fabiu Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
After a break, the 2004 European vice-champions secured the score with four more goals.
Peter Yirachek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions go to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at coach Michal Bilek's team and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Peter Cech in the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented a potential autogoal of Tomas Syvok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when the duet of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was on the field.
Damjanovic struck from the edge of the penalty area in the 40th minute and nearly scored a goal for Chehu.
After the break, the bar saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper Chekha after FC Seoul forward left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although now there is almost no doubt that the coach of the national team Gus Hiddink will now make a place on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croats are in the final round of the European championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long shot hit the rack in the seventh minute, and the striker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandzukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which already looked confident in its place after a 4-0 win in the first stage - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the team of guests equalized the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but it was only in the 23rd minute that Robbie Keane of Los Angeles made his first net goal kick.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Having bypassed the defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in the right place and, letting the ball through the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more research and development opportunities and employ thousands of people,” Bill McDermott, SAP’s chief executive, said in a statement at a consumer show in Beijing.
The staff of 2500 people should grow to 4500.
The global market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
This booming country has about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
Counting on China’s growth is an important component of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Waldorf-based company earned approximately 12.5 billion euros.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 employees worldwide is looking better than ever.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by building on informatization in China.”
Mass Murders - The Human Dimension
Peter Englund’s intense and very kind new book, Beauty and Grief: A Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of characters from which the heart freezes.
Here’s a tip on how to read on: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of characters will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you will get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, dexterous journalists or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what it was, he explains, as "a book about what it was like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and state of mind."
The book "Beauty and Sorrow" brought together the experience of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone will be captured, lose an arm or a leg, go crazy, or die.
Their lives shimmer here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of military operations: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A bee hive falls on the soldiers in this book; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When the cannonade is not far away, and you are a woman and are at home with children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
Beauty and Sorrow traces the fate of such people as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other already published materials.
The stories about their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are extremely alive thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about hardship and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Ersatz, ersatz everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He continues to talk about ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice cooked in lamb fat (and decorated with fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes battered with wood."
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
“You feel that, after all, this is what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and say that this show is civilization and under your starched shirt with cufflinks is not a barbarian.”
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be upset.
“When a person comes to terms with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that this will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But on the contrary, it is frighteningly similar to a “sentenced person who is hanged secretly.”
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new kinds of fear.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit that arranges a massacre while sitting at a desk."
People act in unexpected ways: low actions as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about soldiers who tried in every possible way to catch venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
"The desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is flexible but unflinching, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich-Marie Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this haphazard pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-fiction.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it’s as if he reached out from the book to the page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and set fire to the match.
After the previous error - carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park should have had the fewest people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the others were first told they were going to the drills.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence emphasized how much importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could be no question of a repeat of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to free Zuccotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing, watching as the occupation unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island with the expectation of Zuccotti.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police - referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was referred to only as “training.”
“The few cops I know who have been called to this case have not been told they are being sent to Zuccotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were at the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed inside before the deadline, hearing about these plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including forces from the districts - a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal neighborhood.
Mr Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and go out of the park during the day, making 1 a.m. the right time to attack.
“It was right to do this when the park has the least population,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with floodlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Spotlights and pre-recorded announcements coming from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack up.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate, and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr Brown said the cars with cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could have taken the picture.
As police marched west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged out, photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp chained themselves together by hand.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
To cut the locks, rescue workers were called.
No arrests were made at the park until around 3:30 a.m., Mr Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Brown said about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violating public order and resisting arrest,” he said.
The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the department's detective chief, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, though present, “did not direct the operation,” Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The fences were set up on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From these positions, the SMM saw police expand the perimeter even further beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, the SMM saw a group of police officers, many with shields, crowding people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The Union of service personnel of schools will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The trial is probably the last resort available to the union of District Council 37 trying to overturn the dismissals.
The six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city lost their jobs on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds run by worker groups to close the budget hole last spring.
City officials flatly denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One council member parried, telling him that nowhere in the budget was there any indication that school support staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37th District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit was being filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing with the state's Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The suit will name Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education and list eight of the temporarily dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like most assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint, the union has focused on a number of layoffs in schools in the city's poor districts to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and there were few on Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget shortfalls."
P.S. The budget of the 36th has been cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for every poor student entering the school.
The union also claims that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The notice used the word "excess", although "excess" is more often said when a teacher from the school payroll moves to the list of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired,” the draft claims, “and not just transferred.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something to do with the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), which praises Libyans for a successful uprising and American troops for "courage."
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties."
The language may seem innocuous, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and never got a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry as to really knock the ground out of her underfoot.
Then events overtook Congress’s indecision.
Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee is “admired by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or split lawmakers like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
The measure, proposed by Rep. Bob Goodlatt (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote by the House of Representatives.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
Goodlatt's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this convocation.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and some more about “control over federal spending.”
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors — mostly freshly elected Republicans wanting to embellish their resumes — the opportunity to brag that they have “proposed” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms for members of Congress, and member of the House of Representatives Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to abolish the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed many amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has another banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th introduced 66.
This pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced in 1789.
“Bashed but not defeated,” Giffords says in his first television interview since the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in the spotlight at a public event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arisona) appeared on a federal channel Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC News' 20/20 program with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from an injury caused by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
Asked by Sawyer how she was feeling, Giffords, 41, said: “Very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special, 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The special described Giffords' recovery after the January 8 shooting.
In the video, shot by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Pull out the lips.
And then her first word is "what."
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows music playing a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see a congressman singing along with doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, said she does not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 shooting, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed then.
The suspect, Jerd Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is undergoing compulsory treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten up.
And you'll get through this, you'll recover and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in the tuxedos applauded him standing up.
“Soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also attended by the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers wanted better.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Quite opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
Troops are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, military officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they are feeling pity for people in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity is quiet and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cansion warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have crushed rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if “a violent evil veteran is hiding under the mask,” said Canshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take up a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the combat campaign.
Canchne recalls telling his sons: “When you talk about your service, you have to expect a negative effect.”
The embarrassment the military feels comes in part from America’s indifference to wars.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that knows little about the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism the way we did in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Burnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mostly focuses on the depth of the soldier’s suffering.
Troops are estimated by the number of hikes they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
A historic court hearing this week will decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private first class Elizabeth Lyman 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant, according to her, at night was raped by his colleague.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male colleague carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the native of Texas brushed off his fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, toppled and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former service members will be waiting hard for the court’s decision at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether to go to court the lawsuit they brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to cope with widespread violence in the military in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs but rose to 28 in the following months — 25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or threatened with sexual assault by co-workers and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or provide proper justice following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence? Top leadership".
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may take part in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open a lot of cases if necessary to maintain pressure.
The Defense Department's defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents that Newsweek obtained reveal a defense strategy — basically, that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in dealing with local women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for armies to become modern, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are preparing.
At Yale Law School, a Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against four major military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, a non-profit association of American Vietnam War veterans is preparing a lawsuit against the military, which centers on diagnoses of "personality changes" that are put to victims of violence in order to remove them from service - a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Organization for the Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Affairs Department, accusing it of discriminating against pension claims from people who claim to have been at risk of sexual violence while on duty.
Nine separate bills proposing a series of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But, as is known, attacks are often not reported, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases went to trial - half the number in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call the attacks on them only the first among a number of other injuries.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to a string of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive description to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read out,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was about to give birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't his trial. It was my trial.'"
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavorable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs will move forward is a difficult question, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict stands that doctrine, which has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and disincentives it imposes.
He adds, "The chances are pretty much against them ... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing isn't in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a regular guy outlining his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to a mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared at his first public trial.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just need to go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting close to them is not difficult,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber populism by the British research center DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to single out the necessary demographics with scientific accuracy — something marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pitched them ads, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ads offered the user a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results aren’t as startling: Online supporters of right-wing groups are often male youths dissatisfied with immigration.
“Those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, which are expressed in “Likes”, posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-relevant information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site’s title in the title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who can’t be approached on the street with a notebook.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never have accepted you,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you address them directly."
Others say that with this site it would be possible to identify and research social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunk statuses too often.
“You can’t solve a problem without identifying it,” said Washington Post co-author Dimitri Christakis and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, mid-term voter turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that only they have access to — champions of cyber-freedom have long insisted that the site should make its vast collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about what a researcher can observe their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using students’ public Facebook pages.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to find out how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite years of his work in technology research, Selvin thinks notebook and pen are still the best research tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and much of social is still happening offline."
“Cold and inhuman”: Anders Bering Breivik for the first time publicly appear in court
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to orchestrating a double attack that claimed the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of 500 people in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
“I admit my actions, but I don’t admit my guilt.”
Judge Torquiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others - to make sure that he is kept under lock and key.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” one survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I felt a little bit better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Shown In Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest revelation in the newly discovered interview, which was recalled ahead of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizationist of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skillful labor."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the television series Triumph of the Nerds about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the mass adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview went missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which airs at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of in-depth interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to state his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface where he seems annoyed by Kringley’s questions, forcing him to move more quickly to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
The Lost Interview is something ominously prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' posthumous evaluations, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Throughout my time in business, I kept asking, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answers you invariably get are, 'Oh, it's just done that way.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to rationalize reporting at Apple.
Frustrated with a way of recording costs, often starting with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted using “clarification”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business costs down to the smallest detail.
A joke about the Pope:
Jobs talks in detail about the “blue box” he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a payphone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the globe half a dozen times, and you were screaming at the pay phone, and it was infiltrating a minute later into a nearby pay phone,” Jobs says with a grin.
“We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever have come along without it.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one famous antics he and Wozniak had practically dealt with by calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two burst out laughing just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and the cold nickname of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s Palo Alto research labs, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for it.
Improvised innovation:
In several interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of circuit boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think over both the assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced while developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300] and I was fed up and came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Companies that are losing energy:
Long before he spearheaded Apple’s resurgence, Jobs foresaw exactly how many industry leaders would go wrong in their vision and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are] the types of people who end up leading companies and the people making the product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times bigger, he could have been a Microsoft of the '90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a great amount of skillful labor... when you promote a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You’ll learn a lot about its intricacies.
There are compromises you need to make - some things you won't be able to make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - connecting them all together...
Ultimately, it all comes down to taste — it all comes down to trying to express yourself at the best that humans have ever produced, and later trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law, while the court is considering the case
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious issue of whether he would listen to President Obama's health care law challenge, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored at a luncheon sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
The case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss petitions filed for consideration.
One case on the agenda was a motion backed by 26 states challenging a sweeping health care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, a pivotal debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a hindrance in the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the judgment is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that has consistently championed conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
Attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law.
Honorary guests at lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not at all against ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they would probably fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This staggering breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts statements by some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Case.
"Judges have been drinking and having dinner at an official fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now being heard in court".
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to confuse court cases with groups involved in cases such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this raises an ethical issue with respect to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court level of the first instrument.
Her critics demanded that Kagan decline a hearing on the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan has not shown that she is going to do so.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Order for Aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is an aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for all these 50 aircraft is $ 18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in dollar terms for commercial aircraft - 50 two-pass Boeing 777 aircraft.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total list price to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai 2011 Airshow.
Later on Monday, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger amenities.
The list price for six aircraft will be more than $ 1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neil Diora said.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in fuel prices, which usually hurts airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, is not so damaging because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from encroaching on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded to increase the carrying capacity and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have failed to implement her bid for governor Michoacan's seat during a fierce state election, and she said Monday that drug dealers helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is called the leader in the race for the place of the governor of the western state.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country,” said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our election workers... They grabbed ballot boxes, put up obstacles... and forced people to vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She is preparing for a comeback, and winning at Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderon, the National Action Party candidate, or MHP, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now owns the governor's seat, came third - a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Moreglia, denied links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacan was long dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election, when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates pulled out of the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michoacan look, the victory will give a driving impetus to the party.
The man who should represent the PKI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has ordered India and China to be ready to help save the euro zone from a European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of ADB’s Manila office, said the two fastest-growing large economies must “do everything they can” to accelerate the currency bloc’s recovery through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe’s difficulties “impartially,” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
“Anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been hit hard by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing has skyrocketed, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s unfolding debt crisis has raised fears that it could lead the global economy back into recession, and has led to calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided tremendous strength in the negotiations with Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital injections.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have tremendous challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a prerequisite, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be very difficult politically to provide assistance to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on holidays to the sea, and that won’t be taken well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, unprofitable enterprises such as railways.
Neg said the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “reducing risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Potential Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta escalated the situation Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to the $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger a 23 percent overall cut and the end of many new projects.
"Such a drastic reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to lay off many of our civilian workers and, as the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off civilian workers to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will eventually affect military units, Panetta said.
“While military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by sequestration, military achievements will be seriously affected by a major disruption in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
"Contract personnel will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops."
Staff will be cut, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be broken.
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of the sequester at the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
“It’s not an option that we can live with, and it’s not an option that we have to impose on ourselves.”
"Sequestre is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta’s letter or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls for the Pentagon to be exempted from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was completely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the leadership of the Pentagon after many years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might come next: a shelled, but nuclear-free force.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of an airplane without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out a mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and unable to fight potential enemies.”
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined new details of how the cuts “create significant operational risks: slowing down responses to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severely limiting our ability to be first in deployment and response anywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face hurdles, including those that have already passed tests, and some are only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its backers say it’s a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught talking to U.S. President Barack Obama at the microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York congressman and online exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his antics, which was quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during the campaign related to the cover-up of extramarital affairs.
And again, no one living at the time would ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating in school and college exams are common.
There were cases when teachers gave students answers to the tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Mentors who have to teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many lies are we facing?
During one day, studies show that you can lie 10 to 200 times.
Much of this is now believed to be a lie for salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes they met each other.
Identifying lies or incriminating lies is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game similar to, say, a charade where you have to exclaim "Fucked!", lie detection is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific evidence gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look in the eyes.
They do not always stutter, stutter, blush or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, the structure of questions and time characteristics.
I’ve spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of lie knowledge, and it’s clear that lying detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and helps navigate in our complex world — especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone else’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they say are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty about cheating on you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "defining the initial state."
This helps provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping with their feet in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see a kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceivers can fix the top of their body when trying to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show "relief after an interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change of posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-examination signal just to look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled on and used the past tense, claiming his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search across the country.
Adverse people can also use distance in speech: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely perceptible.
Someone can use “qualification language” when answering a difficult question: “Okay ... in truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know”.
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic means to detect lies, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to become a victim of skillful scammers in professional and personal life.
Controversial pipeline plan needs review after U.S. threat to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering labor unions but reassuring environmentalists -- the company, which is about to build the pipeline, says it will willingly review the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said on Monday it would remove the planned oil pipeline from an environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident the project will still receive approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually gain approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and Ogala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," Congressman Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to push back the decision until 2013, after elections next year, although authorities have denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama in a written statement last week called the decision a call by the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline should stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It has to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, he has to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but is loved by labor unions, who hope for about 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up movement from the Sand Hills area and Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current study on environmental impact showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said the department's auditor ordered a separate examination of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another is whether the choice of firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate since it was affiliated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly making a child sick from fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle began to rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point that she puked out in fear.
Lady Marmalade’s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that she suffered “personality change, sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers,” her family says in Manhattan’s Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Roseanne Monk went down in the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanne Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle angrily reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door,'" Monck said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'
She became enraged and began to use swearing -- word on C and word on F -- on elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her attendants had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Roseanne Monk.
The baby was crying so hard that she threw up, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives do not respond to calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money that he receives to charity to children with cancer.
“The goal is to get Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for his actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate issues have slowed the economy
During Mario Lopez's first year in power, unemployment and the illegal labor market rose in Sinaloa, foreign funding declined and the economy weakened.
2011 is the year that will go down in Sinaloa’s economic history as associated with the first year of Mario Lopez Valdés’s government, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Not only did the low temperatures of February result in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a decline in economic activity by a total of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by frost provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55.053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53% of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19%, a share that is more than the number of people.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is tainted by many factors, for economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions that were taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is due to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, since it is difficult for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Cervantes said there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States was limited, primarily because of difficulties with entry, and the second because once they entered, they already face many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, the unemployment rate increases,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa’s labor market analysis is worse when you look at the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malpractice, another reminder of working in the state is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state’s FDI stood at $630,697, a drop of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded just 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly fell on service companies.
Debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government asked the state Congress in July to approve a 3 billion peso loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and until November, no sector of the state’s economy was expected to benefit from the debt.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Slowdown of the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as early frosts this year had stalled the state's economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not become fast enough to create economic dynamics that allow us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue the most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we found that we were working on it, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - such a sentence was imposed on a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The attorney general’s office said the convicted drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a health crime, in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the street of Cypriano Valdés, in front of post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck in which he was carrying a black bag in a box in the car, and in the passenger seat - a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was placed at the disposal of the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be a prisoner in the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
You need to contribute to the work
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or long-delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programmes had evolved so far, they were in danger, as the state government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
“They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they did not give us a penny, when from the beginning of July they had to give us a part,” he said, “in order not to delay, we started work and they are very advanced, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the board's term the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capacity to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, to access these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state owes,” he explained.
Although the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that a request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interest relating to them would come as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny."
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have befallen the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and House of Representatives against a presidential decree that shifts the so-called “digital TV transition” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not cast to annul it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in law by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive power cannot determine the general rules of measures for which the state administration should prepare.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of state policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is related to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate, the management of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting societal needs that have not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive branch, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan analyze the possibility of counting the "voice for voice"
The difference between the first and second places in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, accounting for 879 out of a total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is real with respect to this year’s elections in Michoacan, where, according to data from the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREC), the difference between first and second place in gubernatorial elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes accounted for by 879 of the total in the 6.074 protocols.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacana (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not pass the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame specified in the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature, and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal", since he has no right to "allow or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of a “vote-by-vote” Maria de los Angeles Llanderal argued that with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of the IWM, it will be possible to submit a partial or complete counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no protocol for voting and counting documents in the ballot box or it is not at the chairman's office; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the proposed winning candidate in the election in question and the one who won the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition from a representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
A total recount will also be made if, at the end of the normal recount, it is established that the difference between the winner and the second-placed candidate is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a petition from the political party whose second-placed candidate is excluded from the ballot boxes that were taken into account in the partial recount.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, even excluding 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a survey and funeral mass was held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attending the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel’s ashes arrived in the chapel, located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he underwent an examination by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member while in high school.
“His desire was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains, he always said this to his family and friends,” Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot’s sister, said.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to attend the College of Aviation in Sapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he was dizzy even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He will be taken to the last path.
Shots of guns thundered in honor of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress in his studies, and in sports, were the last way.
Basio Cortez was killed recently when a helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Provincial Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of this ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortez, a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral home of members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, on an esplanade of a training school where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Kaderate farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereita Jimenez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was discovered on the 1.5 km of the Cadreita highway towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that in the village house, the wall of which is painted beige and brown, the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, just three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no casings on the spot.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group to another, and in it and in the gate there are several holes from bullets.
11 Caught in Kaderite
The Department of Homeland Security has identified 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in Kadereit municipality, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the colony of Los Alvero, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel were making a patrol detour in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereit when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian president to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the Italian president to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and hurt the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monty, who is scheduled to meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday, would confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is now well defined,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
At the heart of the pressure on Monty to hasten, volatile markets have set Italy’s BTP bond yield at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to bail out.
Emma Marchegaglia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monti, "We have said that we will actively support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centrist-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the government majority consisting of technocrats who form Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will end his series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi will resign, the cost of Italy’s debts has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said his government would exist until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before calling a new election.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the financial situation affects the process.
Political sources reported that mutual distrust and disagreement between parties made it more difficult to include political figures.
The Spanish have more gaming experience than the Ticos
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players claimed to have played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica when compared to the 22 players summoned by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, have a whole list of Class A qualifiers, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and in strong Premier League clubs have been very active this year in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
It is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or World Cup.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in an area like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We can see that the top of the list in the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as the best last week by UEFA, along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and scorer Schalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost approaching a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica side alongside Michael Umana, left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and goaltender Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five crossed the line in 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeif with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain against Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquetsa (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In the national team with less than 30 appearances on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Mury with 23.
The rest didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one to bring in more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It’s been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the assertion of bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is available online in The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some dedication to the band; fans live in suspense in the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We had some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope it brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, that’s how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, we can say that you have made a grand show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that happen?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe what you did?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we’ve been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are excited about our successes and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We are happy to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things are going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flowering of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group appears from the same city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and it’s an honor to be part of the Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and in the same lineup for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music and it couldn’t have been better.
Your attitude to the word fame was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it has done, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we’re writing really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and did not release any albums until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of disappointments because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the producers sent us some video offers and it was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas has to offer live and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Heather Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping grunge relevant even though it’s no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came along at the same time, and if it’s important now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, but now it has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you’re growing up and you’ve had some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or a friend, those events start to affect your creativity and your music, and those two songs certainly reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a state hospital to be examined for the loss of muscle strength that is seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, due to which he was operated on four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said he believed Fujimori should be a candidate for a humanitarian pardon; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for cancer of the tongue, lost 18 kilograms in weight, to which other diseases were added, such as strong erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the forces of the Army Destruction Unit, which operated in secret during the first years of his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President Jose Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin talks on the region's political problems.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations,” as the leadership of the South American country published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon's support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked a protest by Uruguay and a recall for consultations of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has essentially had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave this “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not use international standards of tax cooperation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has boosted trade between the two countries.
Mustache plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will be available in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to report how stereoscopy will work without glasses,” said the head of the press service of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because until now, successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “on the second lap” to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero’s return to the handheld console, something that hasn’t happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks to the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, the plumber with a mustache needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, scenery, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun for him to answer in the United States for a $70 million money laundering plot.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision is related to the independence of the judiciary and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance has already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “hands-on” legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano, Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug sales.
What Kolom did shows the executive process after exhausting all legal and constitutional courts to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling Q120 million at the Department of Defense during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter-century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results at a ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or subject to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political representation during the election showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education consultant, Ernest Maragal, and ex-Lieutenant of the Mayor and current Ecosocialist, member of the municipal council, Rickard Goma.
Also appearing in Fabra I Coats is the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris, and La Caixa's Social Work CEO, Haume Lanasp.
He said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and instilling hope in people experiencing difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
Captured building where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on 51 Balmes Street.
12 occupants left the building at noon yesterday without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied at noon yesterday, where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be pass control here," the manager said.
The squatters, who captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, appropriated all the electricity and some of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by visitors to the club, but by squat residents and, above all, by those who attended parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and now for nine months, as he “forgives” her to pay the rent.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week "immediately evacuate the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have appeared in neighbors, and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months, squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them have had break-ins.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and firmly resist the culturelessness that is happening in the building.”
So, yesterday, police evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police drove into Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
A park or a mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of competition after disputes about contributions
16-Door Municipal Competition Resumes Debate on Collserola's Role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now defunct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not to the north-south, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 contests for many other gates in Kolserola.
By the gate is understood the idea of the park, of course.
Either that or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
The question is: Kolserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic of discussion for all Barcelona architects.
This is perhaps the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people get to know each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to exactly one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain", when Ildefon Cerda's proposal, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We have to admit that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, due to its excellent accessibility.
The colserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the title “Colserola gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as an entrance to the park, but as a restriction of some areas where we have to act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of forecasting public space” after the experience of the 80s, which ended at the Forum site with “its swan song”.
The first fear is the actual limitation of the boundaries where one can build.
"Limiting something is preparing the next step," I mean, the transition.
“We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [in terms of the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola that "should not be missed", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor's office offers his profession to join this project "from the very beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues), which was supposed to create: "Architects should be just a tool."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this part is complex, as the rules of the competition lack the general appearance of Colserola: "16 overlapping competitions have been announced," he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, leads to the decision to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap in program and definition with an architect's project for a nearby gate.
From your point of view, the advice is to ensure that the strip directly above the Rhonda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino judicial representative forgave the mayor's brother Monterrey in a lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting an extortion trial against the mayor's brother Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution so that the authorities of Monterrey would allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Crime Ministry, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the instructions of the second order banning the move after the prosecutor ruled out bribery crimes and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kadereita for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving time in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as charging 1.5 million pesos to representatives of bookmakers in exchange for allowing the operation, was quite obvious.
On Monday, Red Casino's legal representative, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek clemency for the region's mayor's brother, so he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the gambling house's partners would grant a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to voice the name.
Based on entry 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements can be made after that regarding the process that was planned against him; nor will any damages or punishment be required.
After the hearing, the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
A court official, Jorge Yanes, went to the San Nicolas Municipality prison in Garza to notify Jonach that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in the accident in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed showed that the helicopter hit directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity, without attempts by the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Hacome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees at 25 meters, where the facility lost its fuselage."
He also said that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the transportation of people.
He also said studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transportation of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
By now, he said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the presidential helicopter was flying at cruising speed during the strike and that it was on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a conventional flight maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hacome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports revealed suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed for the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for an area of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Scattered debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
Scattered debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground in structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
Unfound evidence remains in the disaster zone in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research suggests that there may have been multiple contact with the ground.
While working on the spot, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9.200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful investigation over a larger area than the delineated area near the site of the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social protection leads research into obesity gene in children and young adults; it is supported by experts from IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is called the Protocol “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence”, which will provide a count of signs associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Division of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the XXI Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was assembled.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where tests involving children will be conducted every Saturday, from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began to be kept in the sports center in Cuautemok (in the west of Mexico state), and since October 8, events have been held in the sports center in Nesaualcoyotl (east of Mexico state).
Once the goal of attracting between 500 and 600 children is met, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with the permission of parents and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of familial hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) would be performed on Saturday.
Cruz Lopez said that this study reflects the concern of health care professionals about the alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just 6 years, there was an increase: in the case of boys, 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 percent; in terms of excess weight, there was also a significant increase,” said the MSSI specialist.
He said that the validity of the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European, and five percent African, a condition that affects genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of the genetics of obesity is the body’s inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories), and it is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit to the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can reveal whether they have at least some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with all confidentiality, doctors transmit it in writing to parents, to whom they explain all measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV and using transport at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie intake, that is, an increase in the consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic predisposition, analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher in the UNAM chemistry department, developed polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, resistant to environmental influences and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road surface were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, researcher of the chemical faculty of UNAM, and adds that if the process of construction and content of asphalted road surface is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture The Technological View of the Pits, read as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract pit formation.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight called maltens, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120, its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius, it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that street asphalt resistance is not constant, but varies throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
He noticed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, of which the last three include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is the bitumen, made up of small stones lowered into the bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is immersed in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying effort, it helps forces to be very well distributed over the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would distribute even better, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt pavement, he added, is placed the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, in fact sand is also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will come into contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute this effort, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of there, this causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, consequently, the formation of pits.
In the formation of pits, he said, the first wear layer and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, this process should be paid attention at the first signs of maintenance programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be associated with transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still a lot to learn about bitumen and do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair pits with ease and without using high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to want to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to get on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
Based on the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Maria Atlantika won the crown and sceptre, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1981), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Belini Alyala (1979),
The question that many are now asking is:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, for a reason she was elected the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face according to Vogue - the titles that the Queens possessed, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the Miss Colombia crowns.
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?” posed by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literary Society Let’s Read.
She answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood, The Little Prince, is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all be reading, and at the moment I am reading a book by Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: “the universe is wise, what is going to happen is happening.”
And all of you, please read at least a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the voiced hypotheses - Valle burned from favoritism.
A Bogota reporter suggested that because she was preferred, she was greeted with a standing ovation, and she was the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Oster's cooking competition, spectator voting for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which excited the jealousy of the other candidates, caused stress for the Queen, and as a consequence, she did not shine on stage."
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's How to Go Home program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle recently avoided communication with the press and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the selection, international jury member Lucy Doti said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects,” she said.
There is also speculation that the representative of Valle sinned with defects on the buttocks and fibrosis, which was visible on her stomach, but this is controversial, since the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens consultant Jorge Hernan Orozco notes that Melina had a bad body, which was better, "but the problems of abdominal fibrosis, which for me was not very noticeable, made her lose points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had undergone surgery.
“The operations are good, but the representative of Valle does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National beauty contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say that it was a woodpecker, which Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for the fact that she lost the pleasure of getting the crown.
Either way, the fact is that today Melina is starting a year of rule, not as queen but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A criminal from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, CTI criminalist Kali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminologists working at CTI, this week it was the turn of Elizar Gonzalez, a Puerto Tejada man who has spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to wade through the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies that needed to be identified were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and stags.
On the week of Elizar's operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to have belonged to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten images of Guillermo Leon Saens' prints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses and significantly thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a spatula and a flashlight, Elizar matched the body's fingerprints to those on the images.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, a representative of Puerto Tejad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the head of the FARC.
Search for fingerprints
For a specialist in the field of fingerprinting division of Sijin from Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference about the operation against Cano is especially significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When detained, many criminals have forged IDs or are undocumented.
We're taking their fingerprints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to carry away a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to master a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case, we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he says.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles of liquor around him.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative could be suspected of committing a crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist at CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to places where there are fingerprints.
When they show up, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything that you touch leaves a mark on yourself.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People Challenge New York City Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court’s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allowed “angry people” to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the dispersal, capturing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to set up camp in the square, we will set up camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street.
Bray explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent camp, which was ordered personally by the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, angry people have begun to seize a new park, located at the confluence of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they could have occupied the place, but then police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not give the exact number, but told Efe he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people were standing with tents at the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for the movement members, trying to act as an intermediary in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday that will examine the legality of this morning’s crackdown on protesters.
Some of the protesters heading there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, leading to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said some police beat the demonstrators.
The ruling prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and enforcing "laws that were issued after the start of the seizure, or prohibiting demonstrators from accessing the park again with shops and other property previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to deploy tent stores and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the area as it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "for the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was abhorrent and shows that deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” said a spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they intend to organize “grand rallies” on Thursday in conjunction with civil society organizations and trade unions to recall the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in “The Great Repair”, a lifeguard in “Rescuers of Malibu”, Bunny in “Playboy”, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner (ballad performer) Michael Bublé and other outstanding Canadians will appear in the TV program “Christmas of Russell Peters” on December 1, in the role of a very special Maria.
CTV presented today footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for her widely circulated home pornographic video, where she appears with her then-husband, drummer Tommy Lee of the band M?tley Cr?e, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's My Brutal Truth Torpedo tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV is attended by Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Recently, Bublé called “bitch” American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, revived after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and put an end to the cycle of decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that caused the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
The Tokyo government’s initial estimate of material losses was $300,000 million — a blow that, despite the dire world situation, appears to be passing.
After three consecutive loss-making quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 - also personifies the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital expenditures seen from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan woke up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This figure increased by 1% under the influence of an increase in the cost of cars, travel and recreation.
The Yen Mark
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "currency safe havens" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro zone and negative forecasts about the United States, a privilege that weighs like a stone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is not reducing vigilance.
We must be alert to continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a slowdown in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts fractures in the global economy, showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the 100-point average, after hitting eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives grounds for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign a single written commitment.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to a way out of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new transitional government of Hellas is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by the true conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon at his appointment may not be enough to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for a new election, scheduled for February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive power.
A package of 24 programs to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything.”
The Conservative leader took one step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that are supposed to defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of acceptance of the treaty requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the all-or-nothing effect of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafay said the troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek tangle for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the “main” place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain “ranked prominently in the world in the field of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose “essence”, she said, is that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and "especially with the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day - the level at which the poverty line is fixed."
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all "responsibility," says Dona Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that emerged during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new abilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main recipients of these loans."
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face".
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a platform for debate, but also a platform that contributes to the “two main goals”.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of these households will be lifted out of the poverty into which they are immersed.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world was “following the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the instrument’s father as a “prominent idealist in the global fight against poverty” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policies on the spot.
That experience was echoed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Cote d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I have seen continuous development," said Her Majesty, whose association with the project earned her yesterday the title of "head of the family" assembled in Valladolid by "the banker of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"The Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic boom, as this is a “permanent obligation”.
Jimenez concluded that microcredit involves “a serious and firm commitment to poverty eradication,” and now “more than ever” developed-country governments must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to people "deprived, in front of whom all doors are closed", and Mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva greeted all those present in the city, which "opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but arose in the fall itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is not as strict as it should be today with respect to Greece and, possibly, tomorrow with respect to Italy.
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which earned their speeches by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schaeuble, Europhile and Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of eurozone countries, but it could also affect the European Commission’s presidential election by a general vote “to give Europe a face.”
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which, obviously, belongs to Wolfgang Schaeuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is opposed to it, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
The soil is prepared.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in dire straits, which like to criticize “arrogant” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just in passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Hospital List Fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an assault on the sick leave.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and make a speech on the issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on combating social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save money in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right-wing campaign for re-election to the presidency, the majority wants to concentrate on sick leave.
First of all, with a view to saving the budget, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the start of the payment of benefits.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose a salary for four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day without payment of sick pay (public servants still did not have to wait for payment of benefits, as opposed to a three-day wait for employees in the private sector).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most are also raising the topic of fraud again, referring to abuse in the issuance of sick leave.
Control will become tighter and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all illegally received payments,” warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks, which have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of Health Economics, the daily compensation costs in 2008 of 11.3 million euros accounted for 5% of total health care costs.
Of this amount, 46% belonged to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand euros.
And, therefore, accounted for 2.5% of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on sick leave in 2010, up from 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An arithmetic average that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare these figures with the figures of European neighbors, it can be seen that French workers are no more inclined to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the total proportion of absences from work in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with sick leave is very low compared to “gray” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 has led to a systematic review of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 conclusions about short-term illness were "unjustified" or too long, accounting for 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked sick leave for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unreasonable”, which is 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the figures of “gray” employment.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to between 9 and 15 thousand million euros of lost budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and, therefore, infinitely higher than the loss from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos told parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to carry out the task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement opening a debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the “primary task” of the new government, since the country’s presence in the Eurozone is “on the map”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos projects the country's budget deficit to be "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the New Government's Measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the tasks of reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European commissioner in charge of the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada.
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutes, and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care possible, not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when this choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Due to medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of assisted euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, that is, the implementation of euthanasia or assisted suicide against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia, because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are less valuable.
As for people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among their other recommendations, that the penal code should establish that legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
Regarding palliative care, the committee urges the government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Meter Pierre Deschan, a health law specialist, described as “extreme” the position of the experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says metro Deshan, who yesterday discussed the summary of the report.
Metre Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Margaret Somerville, a health care law specialist, also expressed “categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a ‘manifest for euthanasia.’
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the data of the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on Assad to cede power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration in front of the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday increased diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for the resignation of President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about forty more civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
“If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the king of Jordan, a neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country that Turkey is increasingly hard on.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly hard line against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces have been killed in the Daraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other residents were killed in gunfire and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the Arab League to exclude Damascus, which, according to him, is a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, journalists and military observers to enter the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for UN monitors to be sent to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to resolve the crisis, adopted on November 2, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where fighting is taking place and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to overcome the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form their team and execute a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European commissioner yesterday participated in a discussion with political parties ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of the program, which involves many victims, said Francesco Nucar, a spokesman for one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with a candidate for prime minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask Parliament before Friday to vote on confidence to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he was convinced markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment by the president was initially approved by the markets, but the concern arose again, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was supposed to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini said the new government will receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr Monti has guaranteed that by taking office he will work hard to ensure that Italy will again become an important actor in Europe.
European Commissioner Ollie Rehn said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget target despite a austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded, inter alia, new austerity measures.
Italian boss Emma Marchegaglia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth can not comply with the parameters of the deficit.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence when he was European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", a "professor" symbolizing the "challenge of seriousness" and the "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as Italy is due to make payments on public debt worth 200,000 million euros by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, the American agency specializing in the field of atomic danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “beginning in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds explosion methods.”
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to set up a company producing "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “clear signs that Iran’s development of a nuclear detonator system was aided by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, anti-Muslim crimes increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racially and religiously motivated violence slightly decreased or did not change over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared with a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14% increase in the total number of religiously motivated crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is growing again, Human Rights First stresses, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is especially significant,” the organization adds in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious violations of human rights,” added Paul Lejander, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting of hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality, and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and other “name” allow you to follow more easily and directly the activities of other “twitters”, Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) you track, and those who track yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they will publish messages, if they will subscribe to new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before going public across the network on Monday, Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively quite obscure and as using rather obscure terms (RT to repost someone else’s message, ?followfriday to recommend tracking other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, opens itself up in this way to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation with the help of “tweets” on the Internet.
"It's useless, intrusive and too Facebook-like."
Functional activity will help me to better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote .
Austria
Introduction of the “golden rule” of the budget into the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “golden rule” in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies of the state credit rating of Austria (triple A).
Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with Austrian public debt at 74.6%, well above the upper 60% threshold set by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest of three thousand million euros more each year, said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and foreign minister for Christian Democrats.
Thus, Austria complies with the demand of the summit of the Eurozone member states on October 26 in Brussels; heads of state and government demanded the reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and the return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian government’s ruling resembles the “German model,” as Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule.”
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced every year by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and since 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force the national debt to fall below the 60% mark fixed by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Yoshihiko Noda
Threatening new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historical mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new power record since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the buying of investors who perceive it as a “safe haven” in these tumultuous times of falling economies around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this yen growth will kill the fragile germ of recovery.
The world's third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter of 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the prime minister feels the yen’s high price does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps”, making it clear that no additional easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros), raising to 55,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) the ceiling on the amount it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties with the repayment of loans by the euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Worried investors are just too worried about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the weight of new doubts of market participants about the ability of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its view on Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Aquino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This is a return of concern about the future of the eurozone, which is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, the opportunity for a country in a difficult situation, to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year bond yields reached 6.85%, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the exchanges for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be his government’s “primary task.”
Spain came under fire from markets ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
The spread between interest rates on the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expecting growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised downward the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 am, the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
With 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will become necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity constantly, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat the climate imbalance - a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany is left alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which has made its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one plant to its kit, resuming construction of the station, which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although Germany’s renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion for turbine construction, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; due to which carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the key to maintaining industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country’s energy policy made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect ones.
Highly export-oriented, it attracts a whole galaxy of internationally specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 thousand million euros per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to last sixty years if its manufacturer was scheduled to close?
To solve the energy equation, we must recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centers, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are full of the same security obsession.
Over the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but with no consequences for humans or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the reactor arrangement and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy professionals wishing to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a boon to the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policies have been criticized on various fronts - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated to the policy figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberation, May 23) said that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters.”
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The left and right agree on this point.
The right-wing tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and the left-wing by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from around the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the country by the hordes of Polish plumbers was felt by both the left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande limited himself to platitudes, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Shape Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restriction of immigration leads to a weakening of growth and reduces employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, by provoking lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than replacing the local workforce by doing jobs that lack the local workforce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor, and the most skilled - in dynamic sectors where training is not associated with job offers.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarity existing between local and immigrant workers leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migration flow leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profit to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labor Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant, arriving at the age of 30, will bring the state budget a net profit (income minus expenses) on average 150 000 euros during his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his mandate was going to “teeth” to cling to the missing points of growth.
These teeth, which were used to scare off immigrants, gave exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to comprehend European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it is enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the days of Napoleon "Little" it is known that this comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and may even become a "tool of suppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Washro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of a truthfully false Greek referendum will have a double-debunking effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change of policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referenda, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Carte blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound legs into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of a common, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many more of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe obeys the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and from a lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project under people’s sovereignty.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Recovering from the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now demands a European economic government.
That's it.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come to life is another madness and a new impasse.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe that is united on an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe on a political level, a real people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let’s create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more widely.
The world exhibition of chip cards opens on Tuesday in Villepent near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with 11% growth in global microprocessor sales (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important sector is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by drawing a card over the reader.
This year, the world will sell 460 million contactless chip cards against 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will make up almost 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France starts from a more modest position: 400,000 Visa contactless cards are in circulation.
But big stores are accelerating.
This year, Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
To move to a higher speed, it is necessary that banks provide equipment to their customers.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gerard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to make such transactions.
“They were postponed.
"But they should really fly away next year."
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Burten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June next year in Caen.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will be equipped with iPhone devices that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer to the market that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
Long-held links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even said Algerians were now confident.
“The way these two organizations are used and the reports from the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without going into details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January identified two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the remains of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man allegedly close to Aqmi and a sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly have to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressuring Abuja to address the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and under Imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict observance of Sharia, and its activists have begun a struggle against the unholy central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, committing numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local office of the United Nations will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger and Somalis from al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé warned about the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With respect to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying loud, but detailed statements on foreign policy, which have traditionally been the strong side of Republicans.
Slogans concerning China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often confused with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being promoted by the Old Good Party, has threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulation of their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It’s worse if it leads to a trade war,” he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a grasp of complex foreign policy, has been unable to overcome a position that indulges emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill promises to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, showed a discouraging ignorance of the cases.
He recently called for confronting the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power — apparently not knowing that China already has it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who backs Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to torture suspects in terrorism, banned by Obama in 2009, also recommend Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from Republican candidate of 2008 John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan, too, had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower his tone on the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive isn't that simple.
The population considers the balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden, to be positive.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that get bogged down in sand.
And by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas to Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, Russia’s giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between an orchestra performance and gourmet snacks, in the opening of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Through the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe every year through the first pipeline with a length of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to France’s entire consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the Nord Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe seeks greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries that consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us," Francois Fillon said, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel Towers, with no breaks along its entire length, no valves, and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not happy with the fact that the Russian state-owned company will permanently settle off its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Muller.
So, in case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to designers who have designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Control over the condition of the pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as a device circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by a stream of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of traveling at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is carried out only due to its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Muller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay back their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The 4.5-meter-high vents form the outlet terminal of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste for writing.
He has the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by its rectangular black cover, by its rubber band, by its yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old technique of production, moleskin - varnished cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought an old and forgotten thing that was iconic for avant-garde artists until the 20th century into line with today's taste," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We are far from the production of the first years, when only 3000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer, because a notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small towns and was able to gain wide popularity.
“We have followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing despite the advent of email,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition "Around the Way", where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a leopard painting cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for people with disabilities begins today.
Despite the policy of public charity launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, namely 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
“No,” emphasizes Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
“Over the last 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
At that time, the share of the unemployed was not 2 but 3 times more.
“But there is still a lot of work to do.”
I must say that there are still many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them, there are more elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They are more likely to have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities, against 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association commissioned by Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "represented complete people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally impaired."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of disabled workers set by a law passed in 1987.
The last known figures, dating back to 2008, give a value of 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of “taxable” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law that raised the tax put a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before the fight with the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to claim that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the rostrum of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his striker’s antics in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.
“I want to go further,” says Lille’s player.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the national team, this is one whole, he is justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but I'm not in Belgium."
“I have to earn points.”
Left in reserve, on the eve of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "bring".
Not to mention the concept of pleasure.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Mathieu (Debyushi), Johan (Kaba) and Adil (Ramy),” he recalls.
“We just crossed our roads.”
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens thought kindly of "pride."
"Pride" to play in the "festival match".
“Pride” also claims as a “neighbor” that France “became a very high-level team again” just a year after the injury in Naizna.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technical athlete will be flying in the same plane with the leadership of the blue ... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see it in future matches. Including this one against France".
Portugal is very self-confident.
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his return match against Bosnia (22.00 hrs) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, at the helm of which he has been since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played and Bosnia to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it’s clear that the game isn’t over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would calm it.
“It’s a good result, but it carries a certain risk.”
But at home, in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, who should be delighted, although the match will be very tense,” said the optimistic, but reasonable Bento.
“We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being in Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
The draw on Friday against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
It could have been the Bosnians.
“This is a good result, which, however, has some risk,” Bent regrets.
“We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and players that have a lot of individual merit,” he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not to give them time to think."
It’s a good idea to make it realistic this time.
