Welsh additional MPs are concerned about what looks like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to that of a "member of the Welsh Parliament".
MPs resented plans to change the local assembly's name to "Parliament of Wales".
MPs of all political views suggest that this is some sort of deal.
One Labour MP said his colleagues are concerned that this rhymes with the words "bad" and "bad".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "bad" and pwp means "bad".
The deputy said her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a short word transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a "marinette".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a law to make changes to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly's deputies call will, of course, be a question for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which found widespread support for calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional MP, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales or CNC, but the CUP option received the most support during public consultation.
Additional MPs are obviously offering alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a change bill over the course of several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the assembly, such as rules disqualifying additional MPs and changes to the structure of the committee system.
Additional MPs will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called if they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a perennial issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, it was long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represented a claim to their territory, which prevented Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, a member of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent, the churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
"Earlier, as the old people I spoke to used to say, there was a bar and a church at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and attitudes at the moment," he said.
"Bars are no longer the indoor local inns where people go constantly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not be seized for as long a period as the leaders expect it to be, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches," he added, "can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help the temples that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will accelerate the day that these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become parishioners of these churches."
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black area - the Church of the Steel Community in 1870, the Church of St. Martin - a decade later .
The original white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community that was praying nearby was given ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black society led by the likes of John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of traders at the main trade in Harlem's 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but believers under the direction of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the corrals into operation.
The progenitor David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and his successor in St Martin's Church, proudly called the karillion "calling poor people."
An expert who played the carillon in July called it otherwise: "Cultural Treasure" and - "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by the black-skinned musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago .
Mr Meriwether said that he had not been replaced at St Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by the church's false leaders, others by the diocese.
The congregation of the faithful — the governing body of the parish, consisting of the chaplain's assistants — wrote to the diocese in July warning that the diocese was "trying to shift the costs" to the congregation of the faithful, although the assembly was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobbyists in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then swam with the rest to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just excitement from catching the lobbyists, but then he "realized something bad had happened: 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his collarbone was torn," Hamel said, adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, "In the water next to the shark!" added Hamel .
The boy was transported by air to the Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that made the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site several weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victim had sustained injuries to his upper torso.
The Chins closed the approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety's sake.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of a significant advance into the British beauty market with a turnover of ?2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the volume of fashion clothing and home goods sales decline, larger beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year.
The investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on shelves that used to be occupied by TVs, microwave ovens, and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
Existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the firm departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Larger stores are also relaunching their Boutique cosmetics line, so that most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly demanded among younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfumery store will be testing the concession at Sainsbury's two stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of products daily at local stores near the house leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's executive director, said that the trading points will be increasingly similar to department stores because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's, Lidl's distributors using more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, and has also placed several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it says has contributed to an increase in food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to renovate their beauty departments and pharmacies had not ended successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenues from pharmacy stores ended after a series of crackdowns in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago, along with 281 Celesio stores, to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy network for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was said to have played a role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in training our employees to be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands are designed with any needs in mind, and the attractive furnishings and convenient placement make us the best home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones rallied after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million pound sterling deal.
Dragons star Den Peter Jones broke up after TV host Holly Willoughby backed out of an 11 million pound deal with his brand specialising in the image of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There is no time in Willoughby for a brand of home goods and Truly accessories.
The couple's business became similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
Today morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones broke up when a "golden" TV girl confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals for up to ?1.5 million in cash meant that she would not be spending enough time at home.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's fortune of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
Source reported: Truly was Holly's top priority.
This was her long-term future, which she will see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon lunch should have started.
Marlow's headquarters have a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the departure of the leading This Morning, which ranks among the most significant British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in various goods - from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as possible further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin were close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby would become a spokesperson for the M&S brand and replace her with McPartlin as ITV's lead "I Am Celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones reported, "We won't comment on his affairs."
A sincere conversation, "after which we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from media outlets for his comment, which he considers "unpresiding" for having a positive talk about a North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much of what?
Trump said his parade's "dictatorial" voice.
"I don't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have gone into deadlock.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, said to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not been waiting for "appropriate requests" from the United States in response to North Korea's previous steps in the disarmament field.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended in war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have good relations now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"Being on the president's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to infiltrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake at W. Lambock, foreign NGOs were told they were unnecessary.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lambock's population having been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid to be provided.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
Though the Save the Children Foundation and assembles a team to travel to Palu until it is clear whether foreign employees can work locally.
Mr Sutopa, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia always experiences, the country is still well prepared for the troubles of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh, there are almost none in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of siren to warn about the tsunami in Palu led to more casualties, although the warning was.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And distressing disasters have complicated the logistics of displacement.
The hospital vessel that was located at W. Lambock for the treatment of earthquake victims is approaching Palu, but the path to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidoda focused his pre-election campaign on improving Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spent money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funding is haunting the Jock administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka is also facing the pressure of continued interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives are embracing a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool push ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalling the number on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
The oldie received a transmission from Jerdan Shakira when they were about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate creation, which led at 1-0.
He made a fint ball to his left before making a shot at a distant rod.
The attempt ended in a kill high under the top bar when the ball flew to the right of the top corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over Kepa Arisobalogi's head, which jumped, directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shake were always trying to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," Starridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante running, made an easy pass without thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 early in the second half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Attacking the Blues in this match, he made a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before returning to the half-back zone and running into half of Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
He then made an impact kick, passing the ball to Hazard at the gate.
Hazard ran around the defender and broke into the bottom left corner at the far rod past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool are battling Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Italian Naples.
Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Relief Agency reported Sunday morning.
At a press conference, Sutopa agency spokesman Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports many people found themselves trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was littered with rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with knife wounds in the Grayson Muse area of John Street, and the 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people from the area to address them who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to reach out to anyone who has been nearby John Street in Birkenhead or seen or heard anything suspicious, and ask that they contact us.
I also urge everyone, in particular taxi drivers, whose video recorders may have filmed some video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own house.
Today's event a friend of the woman came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several more hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer explained to one man that the entire area was now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, "It's so awful."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in a fenced perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, exploring the multi-storey building.
All who have information should contact the police department of ?MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling entry 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last century-old blow in the matter of "rewriting history".
His removal would be a poetic justice for his similar Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, perpetrated by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate about the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near the Palace of Westminster would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a bad Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid representation of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of the figure whom many believe should be venerated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell many have known since the late 19th century better than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation, the subject of lengthy historical debate.
There is no question that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure representing one side of this clash.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored."
The pig-killer withdrew to the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
"A man known only by his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and blood flowing, next to a shed in the Lupanshui market in Guizhou province," the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to introduce the swine vaccine into a pigyard on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in China's Qinghai province.
He and his cousin are reported to have come from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pigyard was open.
He said there was a big knack of blood on the pig.
According to the report, forensics confirmed that a 550-kilogram diver had removed the farmer.
"My cousin's feet have been covered and damaged," said a cousin from Wu's surname (as quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
A video from the surveillance camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, they have been before.
So, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife had let the animal go.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a downing hook.
"They're just gullible.
They're cuddly and very inquisitive...they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it is moving over the colder waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The speed of Rose, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. according to Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture down to the south.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture, which interacts with the incoming area of low pressure, will in the coming days call forth strong lefties in the southwest.
In places between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall, it causes dangerous sudden floods, mudflows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the dispersed areas of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible under the condition of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert on foot because of the possibility of tropical rainfall being threatened.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and rain will be accompanied by steamy wind and dust.
The incoming low pressure area will bring heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coast in places.
Possible total rainfall of more than half an inch can lead to a minor garbage stream and make slippery roads.
This will be the first shower in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature swings in the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of sharp temperature drops in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moyne, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the continued summer heat will try to get stronger and expand again.
Warm October is expected to begin in many of the central and eastern U.S. states, with temperatures ranging from the Southern Plains to part of the Northeast.
Temperatures in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched interesting witness testimony on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that supposedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of the emergency news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it consisted of conducting a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunken Cavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull her out of her clothes at a party in high school.
Kavanaugh said in his heated testimony that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were watching it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, there are usually problems with judging people watching TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing a playoff or Academy Award.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ran all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearings as well.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him for an address and when he tried to climb the elevator to a hearing before the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes as he was being abused, and this was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, but many women are deprived of it."
Flake said his office had published a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcast networks ran a live broadcast for several hours when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the issue of selecting Kawana's candidacy at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so, only realizing that the FBI was considering charges against the candidate next week, something that minority Democrats were calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several Senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would have no votes to endorse Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of planning to leave the European Union that they were "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one interview alongside her on the first page of the paper was her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "chassis" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EC have single fares was "totally flawed".
Murder of Wade Sims: Police have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU player Dytheon Simpson.
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
"The 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder," Baton Rouge police said.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
"Police took the glasses from the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them," reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said that he confessed to the fatal shooting at Wade.
"The cost of the facility is set at $350,000," the Advocate reports.
An East Baton Rouge investigation published a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force Department, the state's criminal police laboratory, Southern University police are asking residents in the area for assistance in an investigation that would have contributed to the arrest.
University of Louisiana sports director Joe Allewa thanked the district's law enforcement for "anxiety and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was only 20 years old.
Attacking six feet tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
He averaged 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
Ashes erupting from the Papacatepetl volcano reached southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay further away from the volcano after activity in the crater was detected and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
There was an audible gloom in the center and there was a feeling of jolting.
Images on social networks have shown that there are thin layers of paper covering on car windshields around Mexico City, such as Sachimilka.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the south-east of the capital after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence supporters clashed with police over public order protection, and thousands of others joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of separatists in masks, restrained by police on guard by public order, threw eggs at them and colored them with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fighting broke out when police used their batons to deter demonstrators.
Within hours, groups of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" were confronted by present trade unionists shouting "Live Spain".
According to local press reports, fourteen people underwent treatment for minor injuries sustained in the course of the protests.
Tensions in the region seeking independence remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid found illegal, but which was marked by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the summer after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to go the other way.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
"We flew through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to keep momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or in jail awaiting trial.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Pooch, who records a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Selecting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonders: Men arrested after ramming house on car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonder.
The incident occurred in the Belinagard-Cresent area on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was released into the car.
As a result of Mang's kick, Livingston get a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Mangi's first goal in favor of Livingston secured them a win
Livingstone's success stunned the Rangers, and this caught on to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Mangy's hit was great because Gary Holt had risen one level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win on their way to the Premier League this season and will meet leaders next Sunday, the Harts team, who are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers in the Europa League will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continued their unbeaten streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still feels paralyzed after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances due to rude visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before they were killed, but that kind of direction caused Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some points.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty kick was allowed on the Rangers side, and Livingston went on to make their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Menga, who made the pass and scored from midfield.
By this point, Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the team's defense was untenable, and goaltender Liam Kelly was practically unengaged.
It also continued into the second half, though Alfredo Marelas did save Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was deflected by Rangers goaltender Alan McGregor, and Lithgow was far away from the second set of Livingston.
The balls constantly hit the Livingston gate and were deflected, while two penalty requirements, after being called up by Halkett to replace Glen Middleton, and a penalty requirement for the game by hand, were waived.
"The Phenomenon" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alessair Lamant at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For the men, they were wonderful, continuing to surpass expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the senior echelon, but it is worth giving proper Holt for the way he has been stimulating the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grand, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo held Conar Goldson and Joe Warala everywhere on the field.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerard's, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match, they didn't own the ball, only scoring in the gate once, which was something like an alarm bell for the Rangers, who ended up in the middle of the list.
Mixed attitude towards Erdagan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and there were groundless summers when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights problems, freedom of the press, and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdagan headed to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
This city has the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police were saved on security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect dissent over a guest whom one German Turks declared a hero and others condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: Ravarist died when he collided with a car
Ravarist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped, medical staff arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another rower died as a result of a collision at Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Standing Police said their staff are working to identify the man and report him to their closest relatives.
There are roadside fences and bus stops near the site, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin tour: Six staff members injured during riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in a strict regime prison for men," the Penitentiary Administration said.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and continue until now.
To deal with the riots involving eight inmates placed in one wing, a Tarnada special group was involved.
At the scene, staff underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the Penitentiary Service said, "Specially trained prison personnel were sent to fight those who committed the riots at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members underwent treatment after receiving injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Royal Long Lartin Prison contains over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was undergoing treatment in a hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October last year, public order police officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots during which employees were attacked with balls for water polo.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix City, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which may be beneficial for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but this is exactly what may happen early next week because traces of Hurricane Rose remain in the southwestern part of the desert that form the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already published data on flash floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Sol.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or drop in pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona state border."
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts rainfall to fall between 2 and 4 inches, with individual locations at levels as high as 6 inches in the Magalion area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall between 1 and 2 inches, with individual resulting values can reach 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rosa could be a long-awaited one because their region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfall are likely to be useful because droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing a Category 2 emergency drought," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose's path leads to a landslide on Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the hurricane's power with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will face colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore subside.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, there will be an exit of rivers from the banks during the day or evening on Monday.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall is expected to be between 3 and 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sanllra, where rainfall of up to 10 inches is possible," reports weather.com.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The major danger is expected from Rose or her remains, these are very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest Sanora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and mudflows and landslides in the mountainous area.
Attack on Midsamer Norton: Four attempts to arrest killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds at Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terraces area of Excelsior in Midsamer Norton around 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and both others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Samerset area," police said.
Police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what had happened to advance further in their search.
"Cavanaugh is reeling from the Democratic Party's subterfuge and anger," Trump said.
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to repeal the Democratic Party's ruthless and offensive tactics," Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering from the subterfuge and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his election to office.
Cavanaugh gave testimony before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually assaulted her for decades while they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony during her prosecution hearings.
On Saturday, the President said that "on this day, the Americans saw a brilliant, qualitative and courageous character" by Kavanaugh.
"A voice in support of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most accomplished experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service," he said to a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly saved Kavanaugh's election by talking about the importance of Republican turnout during the interim election period.
"Five weeks left to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he replied.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to "confront and obstruct."
"The first key procedural vote at Senate level on Kavanaugh's selection is expected to take place no later than Friday," a senior parliamentary leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of people affected is rising
"At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi," authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves six feet (18 feet) high were battling the shore in the twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
Following the earthquake, a magnitude 7.5 tsunami occurred.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the Indonesian disaster relief agency's press secretary, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before hitting the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palou centres.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Relief Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and collapsing, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The next push continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "widespread" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without news.
"Accidents and damage may be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
Communication at Dongla was "completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely disclosed for not reporting a tsunami in Palu, but officials say the waves were coming at the time the warning was made.
In amateur shots published on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately yelling out to people on the street warning of an upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell ashore, dragging buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, so it was difficult for authorities to reconcile the rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the troops began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vida planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost their lives
It's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Danggala successfully made their way to the city of Palu, where the workers are hiding in the brisk hideouts set up in the courtyard of their office, on the way they saw scenes of devastation," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began grim actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to come in if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Arriani, press secretary for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we will be able to open for international assistance, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing with no news hoped that their near-miracles . . . would be among those that would leave the bleak storylines of distressing disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her was her baby's body.
Gendon Subandona, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"Being older in the field of paragliding I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Hendon told how hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu members who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one grey head rather than two blue ones.
"It means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport on Levy
"On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who was laying bills at a Bancomat in Newport on Livy," the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "run out of behind the Brink worker" and stole the fur from the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who had left the scene, but police did not ascertain the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police by phone at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change to Tweet on Saturday, he wrote: I am officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that has been cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
I believe "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," West said earlier this year, discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, all of us
It went from "Keyney," which means "one," to just "Ye" — a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former employee, Jay-Z, also handled without a connection and head letters.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use army against peaceful residents
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador vowed to "never use the militaries to subjugate the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired a peaceful demonstration on the area, killing about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were ingrained throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those studying, thus opening up more free places in public universities.
"The unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal groups," he said.
U.S. should double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Li, an investor and machine intelligence specialist who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if there is no official MI strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
"A doubling of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area," Lee said.
"Double funding could double the likelihood that the next great MI achievement will come from the United States," Lee said on CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of MI's most famous companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melan University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player, Atel, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency's robotics competition for advanced research projects in the field of defense, and asked if there would be one next to help identify the following visionaries.
"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants," Lee reported.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders; it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lights from universities to work on MI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the United States bolster its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of MI," he said.
China's State Council released a next-generation machine intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, in which industry and science partners must participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the action for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece that blocked bids to participate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed accession to NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments struck a deal considering the proposed new name, but nationalist supporters say these changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The referendum vote question suggests, "You are in favor of NATO and EC membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a cost that should be paid for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievskaya, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name will require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was just 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Skopje's 62-year-old voter, Jose Tanewski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the country's name, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and laid out chairs in front of tents set by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want a union with raised heads, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that friendship in NATO would make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming number will be in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia says that 30 to 43 percent of the electorate will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's TV showed 57 percent of those polled planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-government government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City passes to the gates through all of Brighton's defenses
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by a 2-0 victory for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero easily did so.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before hitting an open field.
Then Aguero found himself among four green shirts.
He went around one defender and overtook several more on the edge of the Brighton field.
He then pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
England's first touchdown in the penalty kick gave the ball to Aguera, who used his right kick to bypass Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan's kick to the right of the net.
"Aguera has some problems with his feet," Pep Guardiola, the city's head of operations, told reporters.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that very moment."
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got this ball in the depth of Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sein made several touches before Sterling was able to reach the far rod.
Attacking, the Sky Blues pointed the ball into the net before it popped out abroad.

Scherzer wants to play the "choice points" role against Rocky
After the Nationals were eliminated from playoff competition, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But constantly competitive Scherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies remaining in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
Rocky won at least a clear spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still hoping to get his first division title.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will make up so that the game is probably going to be at the highest level of anything I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start to Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer the ball in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, held a CPR session on Thursday and will be on Sunday for a normal rest.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly saved the situation around his choice of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big ones, the big ones — I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are full of determination to regain power by using whatever means are necessary, you see - meanness, meanness.
They don't care who they offend, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to him, the Democrats intend to "confront and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, mean, backward and false."
He was saved on the Senate Judiciary Committee's earlier recognition of Senator Diana Feinstein's Democratic group, which received a loud evaluation from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you allow the document to escape?
Uh, that.
No, I don't expect - it was a very bad nonverbal language - the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It is impatience to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last one in a number of MPs from the Labour Party to be told we're not welcome - all to express their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The message from the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, says that "we want these meetings to be lucid and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, that's exactly what meetings were like on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not that and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed there ever was one.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is judged from that side of the view whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed that I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would not have made any mention of national security issues or the EU alone.
Every time I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — there's a tirade of insults on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center's policies, saying I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist acts every day, but never evaded.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that holds different views, and with each "uncertainty" movement or rule change, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years I have been given many advices that have urged me not to fall in love, not to be so loud, and then everything will be all right with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which caused my schoolwork to fail, I have been trying to stand up for the best public services for those they need most - let it be local residents or the government.
I have never hidden my political views, including in past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could get confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I'd like to say that when a country is headed for Brexit, which is hurting the household, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour Party Leaders.
But in fact the only message I have is not the Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether it's Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation of the election will be there and political expediency will not prevent me from acting in you and in you.

Ayr-Melrows 38 - 17: Invincible Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat told the final result, but without a doubt, Aire earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
They now head the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just like their best chances of making them masters, coach Peter Murch had every right to be pleased.
"We've still tried our games so far and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, Give due to Eyre, he dared more than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, converted by Fraser Clime, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealized try.
Klimov stretched Eyre's lead with a penalty kick before, right in the break, he scored and then made a solo try, making 17-5 Eyre in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was sprained, and after a re-start, Aire moved on through Stafford McDowell's attempt implemented by the Clims.
Air, acting Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt at the end of February pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for kicking the Clims without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Aire.
Klimov realized his attempt, which he did again almost after re-starting, after Kyle Rowe got hit by David Armstrong in the penalty and sent flanker Gregory Henry to the field's fifth try.
Star Still Game is like, ready for a new career in restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is about to enter the hotel business industry after it turns out that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show series, and Kernan seems to plan to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in "a thriving trade in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the painted motto is "Our Sea by Right".
Adjusting is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict due to 19th-century resources is still alive - as is the urge to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached a maximum summit in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Rabert Kalsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the MS on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is committed to negotiating to provide Bolivia with a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Eva Morales is Bolivia's charismatic president facing a controversial re-election fight next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and this will change little, even if it does.
The UN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision on Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments were considered indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Chilean international law expert Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have thrown it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Morales has lost its remaining Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that holding discussions will be very difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime problem as a political stronghold.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The ordinance is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until they can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompea is similarly on the verge of resuming nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Cheng Yong more than three months after Singapore .
Ree says it is "an inescapable dream" for continued U.S. sanctions and objections against the declaration to end the war in Korea to ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not begin significant disarmament steps at first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump demand a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country is likely to view as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive headgear on the way to the shops in your cities
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a bunch of unusual headwear on the podium for their SS19 collection, which crossed expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has won the popularity of impractical hats whose designers have sent their faces to the podium.
A notable feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat decorated with wide margins similar to feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tim Brown also showed a selection of wise-cracking masks - just prior to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with shriveled lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a snorkel for underwater swimming with a tube and safety goggles, and the other resembled a molten ice cream cone.
And if you keep sticking strongly to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who believe in style predict that huge hats can break through into our daily lives.
Huge-sized hats follow the heels to La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot-wide margins that can be seen in everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label for a very uncomfortable hat that was dissolved in social networks, contributed to another big face on the podium - a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag dressed in a swimsuit.
The dark-orange reef bag, trimmed with accompaniment from the reef and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach stalls on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for non-gable accessories."
John Edward: Knowing languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain achievements in academic success, this continues from 2018 with another excellent exam result underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community beginnings.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't only hope for English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's most recent exams, we see languages ranked first in league tables with the highest enrollment rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of the students reached a higher grade A in learning Chinese, while 72 percent - those learning German, 69 percent - French, and 63 percent - Spanish, too.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will no doubt be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now chosen as a subject just like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you take, if you learn another language, in the future it will become a real advantage if you will possess such skills for life.
The ability to contact directly people from other countries automatically puts multilingual people first among competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff that are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will and will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for Scotland's youth.
This should be done
John Edward - Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts Sunday in San Diego
Start waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play at the pre-season opening Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James would likely play in limited minutes.
According to a practice that took place this week. James was asked about his plans for "six game pre-season schedules".
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's performance time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a multitude of campaign actions.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled speeches next week, including stops at friendly venues, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming a vote on arrival at an election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking to bolster support for those with midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's performance start tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia performance on the Internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider a hearing this week on the candidacy to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who has problems on the occasion of charges of sexual harassment with an expected confirmation in the Senate vote within a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help Republicans facing election in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at "activating the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states as we enter a tense pre-election campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today's action could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team advances to fight to keep hopes alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's fours may have been exactly what you need for this Ryder Cup.
The pendulum of momentum that's going on is a completely invented sports concept that players sincerely believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
Dick where would they say impulse now?
"They had an advantage with six points, and now they have four, so I think we're going through this with a little momentum," said Jordan Speat, spying throughout the day.
Europe's advantage is, of course, four points ahead, and there are twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spitch says, feel that they have a slight uplift of the wind, and they have something to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spite was lethal from T-shirts to greens and is an example.
These laryngeal cries of celebration became all the louder as his round lasted, and he sank a decisive kick to play in a four-field match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His kick, which allowed them to win the match on the 15th, was met with a similar cry, like one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out.
"You just have to get deeper and worry about your own match," said Spiti.
Already, each of these players is gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spait and Thomas are Francesca Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Malivud" were the only couple who did not make a boggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a boggy on Saturday morning, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.
This is happening, and as their energy is like flowing to and from this stormy crowd, and it confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe if the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief job on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was paired with Alex Norén.
Boggie and two doubles on the front nine dug out a Spaniard and a Swede to him, with whom they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't follow, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has become a better team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team is keen to fight, which some have questioned, especially in the States.
Europe advance to the Ryder Cup final with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's matches with four balls and four with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Malinora marked the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an effort to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, reigned in the U.S. agency of displeasure this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in a four-ball match by winning two matches, but they failed to do more.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Furik's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, and he and Mallinari, who was named Mollywood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they miraculously clinched to defeat downed Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCamba by another 5 and 4.
Woods, who spent himself through two matches on Saturday, showed an occasional splash of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-ball matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rouse, resting on x matches of four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the four-ball matches to para 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki - ranked one and two in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time main winner Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas set a control point for the Americans by two points.
They scored a 2 and 1 victory over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in the four-ball matches and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team come back from a four-point deficit going it alone, though towards Furik's owners one only has to draw to keep the trophy going.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will all get it.
North Korea says "no way" will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations was continuing sanctions that increase mistrust in the United States, and in such circumstances the country could not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping testing at nuclear and missile sites, dismantling the nuclear test zone, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"One thing we don't see is an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves in the first place."
Despite Ri republishing the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea was rewarded as it took incremental steps, his statement turned out to be significant in that it denied one.
Ri salvaged a joint statement by Kim Cheng Yong and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," with Trump promising to give security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on 'denuclearizing' and increasing the level of pressure using sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes 'annihilating the end of the war,'" says Ri.
"Recognizing that sanctions can put us on our knees is the ultimate dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. chief noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the denuclearization issue had been South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have become such a dumbass."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed sharply from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly saying that targeting the U.S. continent with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man"-self.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there would still be a lot of work to be done, and sanctions should remain in place until that couple is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he has no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council said it should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompea told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be active and mandatory until we are sure of complete, final, and complete denuclearization."
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006, trying to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the Security Council's colloquium. The General Assembly then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea already three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea within hours of talks ended with a visa statement that he was imposing demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to eliminate the missile facility and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said Kim said the "appropriate measures" he expects are a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump has promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course on proper rest.
Harvard University's new course this year should encourage students to sleep more, and has the goal of fighting culture by studying at night with a coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech on the impact of lack of sleep on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, "Why was I told this just now, in the last course of study?"
"She said no one ever told her the importance of sleep - that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught by a student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were often sleep deprived within a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section has an image of a room on the internet where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects sports performance, as well as the importance of habits before bedtime.
At the onset, participants are told how years of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know that this will not instantly change students' behavior.
But we believe they should know it as well as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking," added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, nightlife culture still exists, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
"Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid excess weight as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaser in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to educate everyone on campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all undergraduates to complete a similar program of study before entering university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students be able to set a clock to know when to go to bed and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of "blue light" being emitted from monitor screens and LED lights that can change the day-to-day mode that causes problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mengo kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another collapse when Dolly Mangy's goal was assured that Stephen Gerard would not receive a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Aibrax wants to record his first win on the way to a 4–1 triumph in February at St Johnston, but Gary Holton's team carries Gerard's already second streak as manager of 18 games to leave his side eight points behind the Ladbrokes Hearts Premiership leaders.
Mengo hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were clapping the parakeet.
At the same time as Rangers drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, with Hibernians remaining behind with a difference in balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after forward Colum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after he has an item thrown from the stand.
Gerard made eight player changes, causing Ira not to play in the Batfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy at number 11, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they walked their opponents at every step.
The Rangers were more in possession of the ball, but Liwigston made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill already two minutes later when the first time Mengy directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gate, and then the midfielder used that chance.
Jacobs Keegan's successful penalty kick caught Craig Halkett's sack, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to deliver a strong kick from behind.
The Rangers seized control, but in the last third of the game, they were more likely to kill than demonstrate a good game.
Alfredo Marelas certainly had to be punished with a fine a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lawless faced off on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Columbia's complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit the gate in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly nearly gave up a goal to Lasan Kulibali and an effective attack by Ovi Eharia.
Although having scored the first goal in the 34th minute, Livy may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the bowlers a good game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to break through Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for an opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard substituted for Ryan Kent in Coolibaly's break, and this had an effective effect when the attacker broke through to Morales, but an impressive Kelly ran in and blocked the kick.
But Livingston continued to please visitors by playing the game they liked, and Lithgow and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long standoff.
Holt's side could only prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to oppose the Jacobs before Litgow went to the bench.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton happened another time after being fined when he faced the Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... day of future physicist Ian Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radio activity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Called Caranad, which involved those seemingly obscure scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on the ground?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms giving in to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Say it's really shaking now"?!!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system "see" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is like teaching the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells can then "see" the protein common in many cancer cells and then reintroduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was injected with a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so they can "see" the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then re-entering.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.Our results indicate that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer," Professor Berazofsky said.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "learning" them to reach cancer cells worked well in treating leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a debate in support of Trump, wearing the MAGA title, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday evening, Kanye West was suspended after a performance where he praised the United States.President Donald Trump said he would be running for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening, titled "City Drive", when he was in the "Make America Great Again" hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show featuring the lead role of Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the handling of the Christina Blasey Ford sexual assault case.
Despite the performance not being broadcast, West's words popped into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to get rid of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They got excited over me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap.
They bargained over me.
"And then they say I'm in a gibbous place," he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Want to see a giblet place? "Talking about what he" would put on my Sperman cap, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to love.
Due to his statements, they withdrew the hearing at least twice, and SNS representatives were dismayed by the message from Veraiti. "The whole studio has shut down".
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of TPUSA's conservative party, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But lead talk show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art', which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially called Kenny West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and has followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg called the cripple Snoop Lion and, of course, a music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then he's also an artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted Murder at Belfast Restaurant

Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington was captivated by idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and for his role as John Snow in the series Game of Thrones in the medieval raw material fighter HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor received a stereotypical macho hero, which means that young boys are often felt tougher to respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he believed "something had happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the ?MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his roommate on Game of Thrones, Rouse Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he feels he has the power to solve this problem.
"I feel like a personally strong guy - when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?"
Keith believes that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of the very male characters.
He went on to say, "What lies at the beginning and why is this taught?
Why study on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel like they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of our time — how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series would end, and he would quit the battleground of the series and would not make docs or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November, Keith will begin to revive True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a burglar.
Recently, the actor has reported that he considers meeting Rose's wife to be the best opportunity to complete the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life is here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with Keith's hero John Snow in this fantasy series, awarded "Amy".
The couple announced themselves in June 2018 at Leslie's Manor in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"One number of such people who contracted HIV through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still persists.
Because of conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread from lack of knowledge and sexual contrast.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data leak, danger and conspiracy theory to her MPs
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters dropped charges on Saturday that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that there were claims against members of the super-right wing and their websites.
"False, false, and a lot of disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sense. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Oryn Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to the Waters office and distributed information to a Waters team member," Hill said.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my team whose data, personal information, and security were compromised as a result of these ashukan and false accusations was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal causes anger," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that she does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They don't have to lead themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives behind their accusation.
They must be calm and agreeable.
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarra, the Republican Party candidate who votes and participates in midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a cutoff if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false allegations.
"We guarantee that the perpetrators will be found," she continued, "and they will bear legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my team members."
Johnny English Strikes Again review strikes fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It has now become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXITU in any new film with a British twist, and that twist seems to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny English, which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "The Rebirth of Johnny English".
Will the satire be able to express itself well about how obviously mindless we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to scoff at things - his name was louder than all the comical faces he had done for non-English viewers in cinematography.
Of course, he is a secret agent who, despite his sage claims to glamour, turned out to be a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a little taco guy who contributed a single note to the Choir of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on the journey and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few nice moments here that weren't there before.
I loved Johnny Inglish, who is approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades knock a little on his helmet.
Dar Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but humor is felt weakly, and so it is surprising especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Unfulfilled confidently offer comedy as the main part.
Humor feels as if it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even Johnny Inglish's senseless accidents are not as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in Bean's face.
The many-year-old current predicament is the UK's serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy community in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of a state agent - this is unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldan.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed-minded man who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Tereza May, but there is nothing like it in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be revealed, she will have to engage some of those already retired.
And this means that for Johnny English himself, things are getting complicated: he now works as a sixth teacher at several shaki institutions and gives lessons on how to be an undercover operator: some good examples here, since English offers Academy of Music lessons on espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Currently, Bo has a marriage tied to the submarine commander, a role that Vicky Pepperdine played a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get horribly wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve problems with UK hackers: with the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Bow start their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers aboard a luxury yacht Volta; Inglish commits pure anarchy because he tries to use the headset of virtual reality at home, with the help of a virtual reality camera.
All moments are pulled out for the last event, but so are the nice and noisy ones, which have quite a bit of a baby in the TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other films about Johnny English I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being drawn up to pay the British for a four-day work week with pay as low as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but they are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants enterprise managers to hand over to workers the results of work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was seen that the employees of the future would enjoy the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade union congress endorsed the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times, "A planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that fits the views in the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy to the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are not generally supported.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: The four-day work week is not a party policy goal, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he had decided to take power back from the "poor directors" and "managers" in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire package of shares because the Labour government can make a "calculation" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to bring workers to company councils and create joint property funds to transfer 10 percent of a private firm's own funds to workers who will hold annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for "60 Minutes" that an FBI investigator working with Kavanaugh must change his mind
An FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh postponed to a final vote on his election to the Supreme Court for at least a week.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Paley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "The Meaning": whether the FBI could reveal anything that might lead to a change.
Kennedy proved more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said, going to the court seat: I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked about the cause of the charge, asking, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive and unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
"I think Brett Cavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"And everyone she calls hasn't been able to believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the International Festival: an annual music event that has a very impressive lineup of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on a large lawn of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes concert, and learn about the event's true goal of ending poverty and ending hunger by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the branch of an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a number of tasks either to "take action", to be a volunteer, to write an email to the country leader, to call any other activities and to raise awareness.
But how successful was the Civic Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a no-cost concert a real way to convince people of the need for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" - people feel like they're doing a good thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers have claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from their supporters trying to achieve various goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet commitments to account for more than $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and executives based in the UK to "help children develop in full", and promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 dollars.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken calling in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a "food aid" project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website, "what makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival responded: It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will suffer paralysis and failure.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are one of a number of peers who are performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use Navy for 'blockade' to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Washington can, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EZ and Middle East markets," said U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to acquire energy just like they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to assure the openness of the sea lanes, and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy does not get into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less equalizing and replacing fuel," he said, calling Russia a "one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "incorrect" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump agrees has turned Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline at a cost of $11 billion, which is being created to bring the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is taking a start in economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the only view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans received a blow in return from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
A major German organisation representing industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at Halioki City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and sort out our failing government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be very serious about considering the possibility of running for president."
During a speech in the mayoralty, Warren shaved on President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday in her tweet, Warren wrote "of course, you need the FBI to conduct an investigation before you vote."
However, the results of the poll, published on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's voters did not believe she should be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Policy Studies at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be bullied.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Devall Patrick, where 38 percent were in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats discussed in relation to potential balloting in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially make the decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic Train Palin syndrome
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called up for service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after returning, I can compare to the results of post-traumatic syndrome and injuries that our soldiers are coming back with, in other families," she said gathered at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a "ballistic issue" and said her son, along with other war veterans, "return a little bit other, hardened, come back with the question of whether there is that respect that soldiers, pilots, other military men fought for, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of attempting to report domestic violence, possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, the press secretary of the Wassila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new policy to grant asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a challenge to new U.S. policies denying shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C. to support a challenge to the policy to provide a shelter, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his friends from the brutal gang" had raped her, but U.S. authorities refused to dock on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, of which the largest number of requests for U.S. asylums come from, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American policy on asylum changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Reisin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislative experience by states, countries, and the world."
"Federal legislation requires that applications for the dock be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a similar change violates this principle," says the analytical note.
Lawyers also said in a note that policies that deny immigrants worsen the U.S. economy, saying often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and "create the jobs they need."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Residence is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
The refuge never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During attempts to find those who survived, the number of deaths doubled
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very stressful," says Rice's 35-year-old mother Kusuma, calming her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute a car 'fast' brings bodies.
Clean water is very little."
The residents began to return to their ruined homes, sorting out the wet stuff, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated on the street due to strong pushbacks that recur.
There were tears in his eyes as he recalled feeling strong underground jolts in a hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was squeezed under the ruins of a wall," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for marriage.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
American ambassador accuses China of 'threats' using 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid addition of China Daily to Des Moines Register - the state's most selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election. This is China's accusation refuted.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the American election marked what American officials in a conversation with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's pressure campaign on China.
Although placing ads by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have now unleashed a trade war that has resulted in the reciprocal imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been imposed to hurt exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in the author's article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by printing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you will find not so many votes against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron Fifth Communist Party of China," he said.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the offer" to print his article, though he did not name that newspaper.
Republicans push back on women voters ahead of midterm elections from Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will receive a blowback, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be brought back," said Grant Rihar, a political science professor at Maxwell Syracuse University's School of Political Science edition of The Hill for an article that was printed on Saturday.
Rihar said he was not sure Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s statements about the investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper from Washington, D.C., said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Cavanaugh's candidacy despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be extremely great," said news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But there may be even higher numbers, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a Supreme Court candidate of sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong hit in return.
"For the Republican Party, it made it some kind of a mess," said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican Party's National Committee at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee voting or the final vote, or whether Cavanaugh will get into office. It's about how Republicans handled it and how they put it," noted news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it is similar to the fact that the Americans have split in the matter of whether Ford or Cavanaugh is right, with a little more in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are likely or not very certain to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they were likely or not very certain to trust Cavanaugh.
In addition to this, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or may have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed by Flake, the FBI is investigating charges by Ford and at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh, when drunk, had sought her as a 17-year-old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate demonstrated her genitals at the party when they were studying at Eyle in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start New Internet to make Google and Facebook compete
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is built on Berners-Lee Solid's open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and who has permission to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that, by creating Inrupt, he meant "to dominate the world".
"We need to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own online data repositories" or PODs.
This may contain lists of contacts, lists of cases, calendars, fanbooks, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this "personally enhancing the potential with data."
According to the company's executive director, John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the ability to bring together the resources, process, and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, several developers working on a contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not complete changes if all their business models were instantly reviewed.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Commemoration of a priest awarded by the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a participant in the battles was commemorated in his city 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack under Belengliz and Leacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper bullet and never found out he had won the highest military British award.
On Saturday in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren on a parade unveiled a commemorative stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone would open exactly 100 years after it was awarded to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a thick implosion and under the strong pink and machine gun fire of the enemy."
He then ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, capturing the gun on his own and knocking out three divisions.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to do and also something worth respecting."
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also erected a wreath after a parade headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said that "it is a great honour for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of the true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have provided."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Pep's pig instead
Just imagine, you've stood up all night to watch a packed transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're denied a view of the main event.
There were 13 fights on the program from San José, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on British television channel Channel 5.
And at six in the morning, when Gerard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were just stunned when the program changed to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night specifically waiting for this fight.
One of the cheerleaders on Twitter called switching to baby multyk as "some silly joke".
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications said, "According to the state regulation at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and needed to be switched to a children's program."
"Yes, Pep's Pig."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said they would be working on the program in the future to take British viewers into account.
"In the belief that we will discuss the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can resolve this issue," Cocker said.
"But now it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to resolve this until Sunday by now, which is Monday by their time.
But we do our best.
Believe me, when the programs were remembered, we got very many messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to resolve the issue by thinking it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state ordinance.
Magoo will promise that next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to tip the fans, but we overdid it.
It's a beautiful situation."
'Disks of a deserted island': Tom Daley felt 'insignificant' because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley said he grew up with a feeling of insignificance for others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation on his way to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Disks of the Uninhabited Island" program in lead Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional lead of this rather old Kirsty Young program, took a few months off due to illness.
In the role of a man who found himself on a deserted island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child he felt "less than everyone else" because "the public didn't take those who were liked by both boys and girls."
He said, "I still believe that this feeling of not being like everyone else and being insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he would not disappoint those who had learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympics has become a significant LGBT activist and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia has urged countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - an American screenwriter, director and presenter Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "it was unexpected to me."
Daley married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he says the age difference doesn't matter.
"When you go through this at such a young age" - on the first Olympics he got to be 14 years old, and three more years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to find a fortune teller who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son is called Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said his "perspectives have completely" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Roby is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is also called as his father, Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be sitting in the first row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't immortal," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - jumping into the water in front of my ballers at the Olympics, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the song's choice - Proud by Heather Small - which found echoes in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now fleeing.
"Disks of the uninhabited island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Mickelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47 match in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get his form back so this event doesn't get unlucky.
Mickelson, who will play in this competition, which is held every two years, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Furick has landed on the bench for Saturday's foreballs.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner split his days between working as a cheerleader and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the challenging Le Golf National field, where hard-hitting kicks are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't bleak enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact British Open champion Frances Malinari, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of 12 singles matches, start with success, Mickelson's match can prove extremely important.
The Fuhrer expressed confidence in this player, but could not say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, stroked me on the back, picked me up and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He's very confident in himself.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and has given very many teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two games.
I planned more, but it worked that way and that's how we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, though Furick said his presence brought the team benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke over people and just a very good person to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players were pleased to parry his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big break may soon disappear
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual last day's Ryder Cup games can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderam, where the European team led by Seva Ballesteras had a five-point advantage over the Americans but finished with a minimum advantage of 141-2-131-2.
"Constantly remind yourself that at Walderham we had a big advantage and we won, but with difficulty, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," said Byrne after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday, and yesterday, and scoring 10-6 at the National.
"History shows me and everyone else on the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to play for all hundred.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
As long as the points haven't appeared in the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, which is what we will focus on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are the best players in the world on the opposite side."
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Byrne added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
There will be individual games tomorrow, and that's completely different.
It's just great if you're on the field with your partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing alone, that's where your true galfist talents come in.
Here's what you need to bring to the players that they need to show the best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go and also show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furick hopes for a better individual game by his athletes than the one they demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furick himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word of it," he said, responding to a question as Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain set his players up for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but always want to have a quick start that you've seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
If the speed grows, then the greatest pressure is on those who play matches in the middle.
We made an appropriate schedule and put the players in the way we liked. You know, tomorrow we're trying to get a bit of magic."
Thomas was given the task of starting to play and plays against Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play against the top gals.
"I put my players in that order because I think I'll shut everything down like that," Byrne said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of the new German warship is postponed again
Germany's new navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to failing systems and ever-increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The descent of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the absolutely new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019, as the Die Zeit newspaper wrote, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but the problems that emerged after construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships ordered back in 2007 are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics are longer periods between maintenance - newer frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern battleships — which may allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country — will become obsolete by the time they finally enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have written about the many "defects in software and hardware" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships only have 120 sailors - half the crew of old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, double the weight of ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - although at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates are made particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's sea power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions."
He stated that the problem was increasing over time because old ships were being written off and there were no ships to replace.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Monument Conservation Society overheard the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by the National Society for the Conservation of Monuments in Scotland deals with small bats and also the brown long-eared bats of Dabanton in the gardens of Inverview in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this area to monitor bat actions during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records determine the frequency of bat calls, as well as what bats do.
A residence map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals to live in.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developer work that affects and destroys their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as can sticky ribbons for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
Spoken is not blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife, bat ears are more auditory than eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in the way of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check residences and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat preserve in the Three's estate in Dumfries and Galaway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
Property manager David Thompson says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Here, in Trev, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of bats before carrying out repairs on the property, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young bats, leading to the complete destruction of the local population.
The convicts are under guard and are forbidden to kill, be frightened, restless, or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Fair, an employee of the Organization for the Conservation of Bats in Scotland, is urging the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and many of the species we don't even know how to live their populations."
Ranaldo accuses of rape, and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Kristian Ranaldo called the charges of rape "fake news", saying that people want to "reclamate themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
Forward Portugal and Juventus national team were accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 for the silence, wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video, the 33-year-old Ranaldu reached out to 142 million of his subscribers hours after the charges were published, calling the message "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an ad in my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ranaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel magazine over the charges, which they called "an unsubstantiated report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said that the player would demand compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the difficulty of the violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights."
The once-in-a-lifetime incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Howtel and Casino Hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Meeting up at Ranaldo and Majorgo's nightclub would be like going back to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as written in Clark County District Court documents in the state of Nevada.
Majorgo claims that Ranaldo then conjured up and said that at "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents state that Ranaldo admitted they had sex, but according to the parties.
Majorgo also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then agreed to a bail settlement because she was "very afraid of revenge" and she was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge because she feels a moral injury for that case.
At the time if there was a place this case Ranaldo was going to move to Madrid Real from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will 'always regret' losing car builders
Britain will "forever regret" losing its status as the world's automotive leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was "dismayed" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at a plant in Bernaston, near Derby in half.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the delay on the border as a result of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernaston - where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be carried out if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. These include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is with what carmakers say about the risk of supply chains resulting from a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that will lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the Derby plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" on future relations with the EU was "made exactly so as to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will allow not only the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of that opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue to operate successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long the production would not last, but for the future warned that the added cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuwalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the trade union coordinator, said trade union members are very concerned: "By my reckoning, if jobs are cut, they won't be reinstated anymore.
The government's press secretary said, "We have proposed a precise plan for our future relationship with the EU that deserves to be trusted."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week", while fighting around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is studying interference in the election by Russia, Trump's associates' ties to Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
To dismiss Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, pours oil on the fire of Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office by means of a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein overruled that.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump, who was at UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a skirmish at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Cavanaugh, which further slowed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not yet set, perhaps this week, perhaps next. I believe that rather a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information."
Some journalists are willing to challenge her claim: Sanders has not conducted press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Programme host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of the briefings was not caused by contempt for television reporters who "work for the public," though she added, "I'll take note of the fact that they work for the public."
She then said that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more meetings with answers to press questions than any president that was before him," she said, adding without specific facts, "We have studied these numbers."
Briefings are taking place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask a question directly to the president, will replace the briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
Press conferences of the president himself are rarely held.
This week in New York City, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from the EU working in Scotland's health care system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and wish they would stay after Brexit as well.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of living applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations continued between the UK and the EU about leaving our country. They are leading to pending decisions this fall.
But the British government has also rushed to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know it's a very troubled time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and beyond, provide valuable experiences and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Linebacker Tennessee State Tigers team Christian Abercrombie underwent an urgent operation after he received a head injury in a Sunday match that his team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player's injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He switched to the sideline and suddenly fell," Reid said.
Coaches and medics gave Obercombie oxygen still in the field before putting it on the force and undergoing to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "details on what it was about the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to find out if the player has been injured.
Obercomby, a second-year sportsman, spends the first season behind Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving a total of 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay more tax
According to the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher salary, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the count of Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in state duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state fee, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters as well as affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high income.
The increase in state revenue is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing donation program for the homeless.
Raising the current state level, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, to buy second homes and housing for hire, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to receive up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents of the United Kingdom, this leads to higher prices and new buyers are making it difficult to buy their first home.
Many of the country's rich regions - especially the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a large number of buyers from abroad do not live in the UK most of the time.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state's supply for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of first housing.
He accused large construction firms of keeping real estate prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas in order to direct a "disgraceful housing situation" in Britain.
Spadar Corbyn announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and stopping "unreasonable" evictions.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in housing construction.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - life for every new generation should be made better.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly elusive, and the homeless problem remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run the Scottish constituency"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his main ambition is to ever become the coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer, after returning St Miren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," Ross said in the BBC Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"I grew up often sickening for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such an opportunity will come if I am a successful club coach."
Among Ross's predecessors are Sunderland coach Dick Advakat, David Moys, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye, and Paula di Kanya.
Former coach Aloa Athletic says he felt no fear of such famous names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success for me will be the answer to the question 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is definitely in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I will only consider my job successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked at Harts coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Aloa return from the third league and converted Saint Miren from a loser who almost got into the Championship in the winner of the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his work at Aloa, he said that "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds incredible because I worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through it when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."
The full interview can be listened to on the Sportsound programme on Saturday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time
According to the study, the ideal time to drink pints of beer is 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but brought pressure to the restaurants' networks.
According to statistics from the pub and bar group, sales rose by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the volume of sales fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA advisory business group that collected this statistics, said: "Continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of the English national team in the World Cup final means that in July there was still what happened in June, when sales increased.
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have so far shown the best result as opposed to restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food also took care of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent, and food sales fell three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation issues said, "These results are being made by a trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volume of sales in the public food market.
It's no wonder that restaurants continue to struggle because sales have fallen 4.8 percent in a year, which is very frustrating when costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the most difficult time for operators who are focused on food, and time will tell whether lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployments.
The sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars, and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is an important landmark in this field.

Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" account showing to their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 - create accounts in the networks that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid rise in "fake Insta" account counts - as if leading to an Instagram photo sharing site.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they keep "clean" "basic" account records to show to their parents, and also keep private account records.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, learned that they had called on others to "rape me".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent school principals (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents aged 11 to 18 had two profiles each, and half of them admitted that they had secret credentials.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where neither their parents nor teachers will find them."
Eilide Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at that body's annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled athlete and chairman, Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to gain many benefits from her experience at a variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit a lot from her work in council," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can help manage the sport in Scotland."
An American who won gold at the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert on the BBC, cannot walk after having experienced a micro-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will adjust and to what extent.
It's been a hard job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again and now I'm doing exercise on the reed!
Thank you for the messages of support!"
An advertisement of a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions online
The dairy pump production company shared the opinion by releasing an ad that compares nursing women to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is called the "world's first wearable baby pump", consumer company Elvie has released an Iranian music commercial based on the video to show the freedom that this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a pigtail to a song where there are such words as, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "On occasion, if you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my chest."
And he sang, "Dai, dai, I feed my children, dai, dai, I give my women."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a heated discussion online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.The reaction to the video was mixed, many said it was a horror of small-scale production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to graze and give birth to give milk, here's just their children being picked up after a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's baby pump hides unobtrusively in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for a mother in which no children are taken away?"
Someone added, "Such an unimaginative ad."
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was "fun".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd like to have one if I breastfed.
Sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's an ad a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a genius product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very entertaining advertisement aimed at a mother sucking milk pump (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and hearing herself "carved".
This ad does not endorse or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible baby pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use baby pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no truths, no tubes, and hides imperceptibly in bras for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave the house while working the device.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, remarked, "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to sucking off milk and its difficulty, while simultaneously demonstrating in an entertaining and enjoyable way how a new dairy pump would bring about extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's baby pump has hit the center of attention.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium wearing clothes from Martha Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without excessive noise are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of migrant children detained has risen dramatically, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration that have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrant illegals who fear endangering their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
Risks rose significantly in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other full-time household members would need to file fingerprints and data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Service official, spoke before Congress about the arrests by an agency of dozens of people who had asked to sponsor minors without escort.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had previously had no convictions.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant portion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we continue to persecute such people," Mr. Albens said.
For faster handling of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with asylum workers saying the previously standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status as an immigration judge will have to use video communications rather than being present in court in person.
Those who are being treated with no reason to provide assistance are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety that could lead to violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers state that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are much stronger, as signs that the child is in a hot state are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving the children to an intentional town without providing time for emotional preparation or to part with friends can make the injury worse, which many have already faced.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of 'occupation forces' of US, France and Turkey
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war continuing in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and not put any conditions," he said at an Assembly meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have had to abandon their homes, "the war on terrorism is practically over."
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, who mainly serve as instructors and advisors to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is over 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for return were favorable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that hold refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he says.
"They are politicizing the exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "exact terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first sittings of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and cautioning against interference.
Why Trump will go on a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will not end his presidency prematurely.
And it will no doubt be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
There are no signs of viewer fatigue at this point.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled, to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the channel's "Rachel Maddow Show" aired 3.5 million viewers at the screen and crossed cable TV ratings in the evening.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand it," says Neil Burr, director of the ABC drama The Conqueror, about a Cabinet member who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scowell, a comic book writer and author of "A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys Club," there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he cheers me up," Ms. Scowell told me.
Chaos is also valuable in that it can be comforting.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington can become as defining a future as the Rove v. Wade case, depending on whether immigrant families are reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you're six o'clock watching Trump's being framed by a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "not-for-print information" in the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket with edible skin (a garment sewn with pride, as written in The Washington Post), the implications are clear.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show he shows every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars (Stars as Pawns) about the changing cast of the show.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll be away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleas this week, behind the windows of his home on the north bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not fail, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging on his hair.
"I remember the kids when we were producing these crazy shows, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleis told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External cash flows flow into a tough pre-election race of midterm elections to the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district has been covered by a cash-strapped lobby thanks to a change in the boundaries of the districts introduced by Congress, causing two candidates to run in elections for one seat.
The recently redrawn suburban area of Pittsburgh surrounds a Democrat, House of Representatives member Conar Lamb, who won his seat in another district on the dodge last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in campaign funding by major party finance groups, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory at a widely-charted dignitary in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This seat has already been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20 point margin.
Political experts argue that Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of El Salvador being punished for supporting China, and then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to recall American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," State Department press secretary Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug trafficking control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would hurt Central America's country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings concluded, representatives from North and Central America postponed holding the conference at a high level dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent them from participating in the Games.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stop considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration is in favor of hosting the event.
And three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while maintaining anonymity.
Their reports are corroborated by other, close-to-administration analysts, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, examples of which currently have very hard evidence in public documents.
Mr Mueller is reported to have drawn attention in the investigation to the possibility of the Trump campaign and Russia plotting to attack the election.
If Congress changes the landlord, Mr. Trump will find himself facing responsibility before that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately to jurors from among his colleagues.
There are many "ifs", and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, just like his peers in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a state coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History revolves around similar turning points, and the implacable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, the Americans are facing several of these turning points.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult position since it was reported in the paper that last year he suggested secretly writing down the president's words and pondering his profligacy.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' retelling is inaccurate.
"How will we react when the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's case is not comprehensive or fair, or when it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual violence and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in an election for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak gabrel who was deported to Aswencim by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers optimistic on the eve of the match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villareal earlier this month will allow them to confidently exit Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented halfback Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season to a 2-2 draw with Villareal, however, he believes that Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a trump.
"It was a substantial match for us because Villareal is a strong opponent," the 31-year-old footballer reflects.
"We started the game thinking we could get something, and scored a point.
Maybe in the end we could have scored the ball, but overall nothing was a good result either.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took ourselves in hand and we had the best half of the field.
There will be another significant night for European football on Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be able to earn three points, but it'll be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of crowds on the stands, I'm sure we'll be able to beat them and show a good game.
The past year has been determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, cross last season's result and succeed."
Women lose sleep out of fear for retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had an accurate idea of what they wanted for their care, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, Nationwide's vice president of life insurance.
That's what it's worth starting with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family won't be ready to help you unless you exaggerate your wishes in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical help, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Engage in a discussion with a financial advisor. he can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can self-insure your life - provided you have money.
Solve cases with legal documents: anticipate court battles.
Get confidence in medical care to assign a trusted person to control your medical care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can't talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing trusts for financial management.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are undecided.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about banned medications and the presence of allergies?
Record these details in writing to be ready.
"It's not just financial issues that play a role, but also the professionalism of doctors," adds Martin.
"What kind of medication is required?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything."
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man received several paws from a pneumatic rifle as he was walking home at night.
The victim, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place at approximately 02:30 local time, as an "accidental event".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, the police ask a witness to contact them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that collapsed on the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection of communications, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donghala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's epicenter by a force of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a distressing disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and a tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency is an administrative unit with status below the province, with 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donghala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times in the past 100 years by tsunamis.
In 1938, more than 200 people died from the tsunami in Donghala, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Dongla in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes swept the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that battered the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred in Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake swept into the regency of Podzi Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as people he reminded of the devastation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes swept into the tourist island of Indonesia Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on family domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin of Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to a report from the KTUU channel, Palin is in the Matanuska-Susitna investigative insulator under a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "exactly innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, for which he is threatened with imprisonment for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B crime punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence, and possession of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact have spread on social networks.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami swept ashore.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, who has killed eight people - a rare punishment not used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly took advantage of a rented Home Depot truck in October to hit a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists in his way.
To justify the death sentence, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" hit eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court materials, there is a possible death penalty for both offences.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigating judge stunned Saipov with a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder to support racketeering; this clause is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of trafficking.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "an early and deliberate planning", and describing the crimes committed by Saipov used phrases such as "offensive, brutal and debunked".
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov Caused Injuries, Caused Harm, and Caused Loss to Diego's Families and Friends Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lori Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlio, Erna Ferrucci, Erna Diego Mendas and".
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last criminal case commenced with a death penalty measure in the Southern District of New York.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York on a federal case was applied was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been punished after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators he felt pleasure from his act.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed authorities that his attack was inspired by watching an Islamic State video on the phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in a hospital palace, police said.
He does not plead guilty to a 22-point indictment.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "certainly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory Member of Parliament says Nigel Farage should set up Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at a Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel uncomfortable" with Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs offered his candidacy for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would already "exit" if Mr Farage had served as Brexit secretary.
But the problem faced by Mrs May, trying to reconcile her disparate supporters, got even worse when the Tories, who are in favor of maintaining EU membership, mounted a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying his best to keep the compromise Chequers Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insist on continuing attempts to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "the mess".
Chairman Bone said at a rally in Salihal, Leave Means Leave, that he wanted to "throw the Checker off the board".
He proposed that Mr. Farage should be made equal and that he should establish obligations for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would already be out," he said.
Member of Parliament for Wellingboro added, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We haven't fought world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely out of line."
A supporter of Brexit and a member of the Tory, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in a conversation with reporters said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out on the streets and electing us.
Please give up the plan and start listening."
In a scathing address to Mrs May, she added, "Prime Ministers stay in office as they fulfill their promises."
Spadar Farage said politicians need to be forced to "feel uncomfortable" when they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us - the people and the politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'It won't get away with you.'"
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, who gave us victory in Brexit, and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, members of the outing passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists brandished Tories Against Brexit banners (Tories v. Brexit) after launching the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adanis has gotten into trouble with the Conservatives over the security problems they faced due to the party program when the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the balloting process for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will "pay close attention to the balloting process for the presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a general assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go for re-election; she is opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Deal, who was a co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it was already the 36th meeting with voters in the general assembly format, which was held on Saturday afternoon in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she planned to vote for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that to be led by a woman."
The arrest occurred after the death of basketball player Sims from the team of the University of Louisiana.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that a suspect in the murder of basketball player J.S. Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditan Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m. eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the shooting asking for help identifying the person featured on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death," Murphy police chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot-tall junior athlete, 6 inches (201 cm) grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season, of which 10 were on the field from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on the course, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per tackle.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the World Championship title after an intra-team deal won over Sebastian Fethel
From the moment Walter Botas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton's qualifying event on Saturday, it became clear that indications within the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good place on the gallows and almost left Hamilton to his fate as he defended his place on the first two vibes and invited Fethel to attack his friend on the team.
Fethel was the first to go on a pit stop and left Hamilton to worry at the end of the overall mass of the racers, it was this maneuver that was to become crucial.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit stop on the lap later and came out behind Fethel, but Hamilton came forward after several wheel-in-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking to hold off after a double cab.
Max Verstappen, on his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the network and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while the tyres held because he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed on the remaining eight laps, so Raykanen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri spoke fantastically all weekend and expressed himself to real gentlemen if I was allowed to speak that way.
"The team has done an outstanding job to take first and second place," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the indications given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "subtle, disgusting and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see angry, angry, and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, is that your escape?
Do you remember her answer...you lost the document-- "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing of me."
Wait a minute.
We allowed the escape... No, we didn't," he added, advising the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the charges put forward by Ford against Kavanaugh and he escaped in early September - but Feinstein denied that the escape had occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story leak," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked that the story remain confidential and I granted her request."
But her denial probably didn't please the president, who so commented on it during Saturday's rally, "Here's what I'll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are fully determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see meanness, meanness, and they don't care who they hurt, through whom they have to step in to gain power and control," conveys the words of the president of Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played back for Friday's defeat, which they inflicted on the Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 return match in a home game on Saturday.
Thanks to a hit by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville, the Giants led by two goals at the start.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalled the number before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard of Dundee equalled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen two goals secured the team a win.
It was the third streak in the Elite League in a season for the Adam Keefe team to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer from Kendal McFol's pitch, and four minutes later, Bavilier doubled the number after David Rutherford's pitch.
In the lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the number on the part of the masters of the field and then Kaun levelled the number after Matt Marquardt's transfer (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants the lead on leaving for the first break, killing his second goal for the meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bouchard again equalised the score, killing the puck at the team's numerical advantage (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five meetings, will play their last match at the home ground against Milton Keynes on Friday.
The airman dies, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An aviator in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring a successful takeoff of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news following a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong underground tremors are still ongoing, and many people are buried under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were saved by the escapes, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the dispatch tower, which was swinging wildly at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in place until Board 6,321 of Batik Air, which was at that point on the runway, blew off the ground.
He then jumped out of the dispatcher's tower when he decided it was breaking down.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian program ABC News, according to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan which was to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach several thousand, and the agency for reducing the danger of distress states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Button is limited.
Sutopa agency spokesman Purva Nugroha reported, "Perhaps the number of victims will still increase, as many bodies still haven't been able to dig up from under the wreckage."
Waves reaching up to six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Rice Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a car 'fast' brings bodies.
There's no clean water.
They're robbing stores everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don't know what awaits them here.
It's already a tragedy, but things can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Vidoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the troops, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reports "CNN".
Earlier this year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lambok, killing more than 550 people.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports one man missing without news after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which was on a flight that made an emergency landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously said that all 47 passengers and the team had been safely evacuated from the plane, which was melting, and now claims to be missing without news of one passenger.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon, it could not report the location of one male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and the team after landing the aircraft on the water in an attempt to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unexplained.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing strip.
According to reports from some witnesses, the plane missed the landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
"It's very successful," Janes reported.
According to him, he and others were able to sneak through the belt in the water before the plane's emergency exits, which had already melted.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming as well as that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors ramming nearby the wharf also aided in the rescue by using a hover boat to carry people ashore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst resumes the course of events on the night the woman was burned by a resident
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has given indications for several hours as an involved expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records from mobile phones to recount the movements of 29-year-old Respondent Quinton Thelis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlett, he received information about the location from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his past statement.
When it was confirmed that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time when, according to him, he and his friend Michael Sanford were confirmed, police were on their way to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford gave indications on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that evening, he stated that he was "lying, since my van was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was Telis's claim that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Records from mobile phones showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Rowlett, sometime after Chambers died, Thelis deleted her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Haley said.
The defense side should start arguing with the parties on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins: political statements and East-based issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have brought back collectibles such as The Fugees and Common, a popularity in the UK.
Another black one?!
A New York City nanny sues a married couple for a "racist" message after being fired
A New York City nanny sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies they are racists, equating the poses to "extortion".
In 2016, Lynsie Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day at work.
"NEEEEEE, YASHCHEA ADNA CHARNASCURA," Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent a message to Miss Morris twice.
As the New York Post reports, having realized the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, who was also African-American, was doing a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris paid for the day's work and sent home on Uber.
Morris now sues the couple and wants to be compensated for her dismissal according to the terms on which she was originally hired, though without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residency.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied accusations of racism, arguing that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her, after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," reported Post's husband, Joel Plaska.
"Would you trust your children with someone you've treated rudely, even by accident?
Your baby?
It's okay?"
Plasca equates the pose to "extortion" and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"And will you persecute a man in that position?
It's pretty tough," added an investment banking specialist.
Although litigation is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, subjecting them to harsh criticism of their behavior and logic.
Padrington's publishers feared that readers would not overeat the bear talking, says the new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter, "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it is published.
That's how great it is to read it, already aware of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he ventured to write a book for children about the little toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a fairly quiet man, and not at all boastful," she said.
"But since Padington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's pride for a child who got something done: you're proud of them, though it's not really your merit.
I think he looked at Padington's success exactly in that key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave due to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to break up with her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Over regularly called to tell that everything is really bad, that it won't last," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I called Nad to say she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to scare her heart slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and it was the very end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was unfolding there.
I couldn't stand or scream or cry because there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - and they didn't know what she had to go through at all.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and tears flowed through my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was in flight that Ned's sense of compassion gripped me.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who are embarrassed to hang out cards to warn suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their dear people who committed suicide are doing everything to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting cards on with warm words and phone numbers by which people can get help, on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began his depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I do," she said.
45-year-old Mrs Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Spouse Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that there might be unpleasant consequences to this."
Spouse Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people in the world that you can reach out to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you need to talk."
Mistress Hasfris, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She said his death was a big injury for them, but had to live with it: "There was a huge hole in the family.
It just kills us.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

Future Brett Kavanaugh uncertain as FBI begins investigation
"I thought we could have what he wants - a limited time and in scope investigation - we can get a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that his concern was that the committee was "collapsed" because of what had actually gotten into traffic.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is explained by time.
The midterm elections just five weeks later, on November 6th, when Republicans are expected to lash out, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect to the top court the candidate they need.
George Bush called a senator to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the vote equality problem and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors from North Korea to South has declined since Kim Cheng Yeon came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo Sun, bringing South Korea's Ministry of Unification data, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Spadar Pak said the main reasons are increased border control between North Korea and China and higher costs that have put smugglers behind the move.
Pyeongyang has not commented on this in any way.
Most defectors from the north are in the process of obtaining South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 residents of North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which is North Korea's longest border.It is more easy to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South — which are technically still in a state of war — have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyeongyang for talks concerning denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards fully freeing the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yan Ho accused U.S. sanctions of lacking progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we are not going to disarm first," Mr. Ree said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brett Kavanaugh a "sterile", she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "historic" and said he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court at his own pace.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called a 'sterile woman,'" led Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted the accusations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and the school's senior classes were being discussed.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "gratuitous and organized assassination of a person" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's performance showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had bias against Democrats.
"I believe he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he not only shouldn't work in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in Rowe v. Wade's case because Kavanaugh was considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings at Kavanaugh's office, he did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say 'how wonderful it is,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified indictment speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and she can't fake it without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was working as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got angry, she cried, but she worked out the technique of behavior. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the co-conspirators, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And just kept talking.
I think it was great."
Tears are allowed in part, like the exit of a sum, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, in which I once cried out of unspeakable anger, then I was grabbed by an elderly woman behind the collar - a restrained chief who always scared me a little - and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be glad they've proven you."
Patricia Schrodar, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt filed for marriage treason on a yacht called Monkey Business and came out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder thought she might as well be part of the presidential campaign herself.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision," laughed she told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was completely unnecessary to them.
Someone called this situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already gone quite a long time, it lacked funds, so she said she would not take part in the election unless she ran for $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who had sacrificed $1,000 to men, had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made the statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly gripped by emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters rather than candidates, and anger at sexism - that she had caught a breath.
"You might think I'm having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Shrodar's prettiest reaction to the press being to her condition.
"You might think that my corporate sponsor is the paperware manufacturer Kleenex.
Once I thought, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
Why a trade war between China and the United States might be good for Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between China and the United States have been deafening, and since the war is far from over, in the longer term, misunderstandings between countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week when new tariffs affected goods worth a total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods that fall into the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in this way, raising recently tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged a symmetrical response to the United States, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to lead.
To force Washington to back down, we need to deepen in demand, but public leaning before the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long term could support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would start the process of a sharp economic fallout is far more dangerous than observers had thought before," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, a research scientist at the University of Washington.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country ravaged by war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"As of today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions to return refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Rydar Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rydar Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won a Rydar Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown as long as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who competed most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water for 3 pairs of the 16th hole, giving up that match to Frances Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinari played excellently in all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this field at 5-0-0 from the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played in his last Rydar Cup.
The veteran eight-cup Rydar Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the player who has won the tournament most with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said the excited Garcia after the European team won.
He passed the baton to his countryman John Ram, who played American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I've followed since I was a kid," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four caps in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Rydar Cup.
Amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus on this score.
The American team competed with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finns, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing defense game for his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we were capable of.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'll be working with the Golf Association of America and our Rydar Cup committee, and we'll be moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been rerouted."
